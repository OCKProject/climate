<p class="p">Some reflection should make it clear that calculating 
 <italic class="italic">Viab</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">K, T</italic>) and the viable controls is quite challenging. For our calculations, we have used Saint-Pierre’s algorithm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> (see ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref> for algorithm implementation). In our case, we have only one constraint (on CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations), the other dimensions being not constrained. However, given the computational challenges associated with finding all viable states and controls, we have to limit the range of our analysis. We chose a range delimited by the minimum and maximum values for each of the six state variables of the baseline and temperature-limited scenarios. From the range of analysis, it is then necessary to define a range for the actual viability computations by finding all states reachable from the analysis range. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2</xref> presents both ranges and explains the relationships between them. Next, it is important to note that we cannot consider all possible values of the state and control variables within these ranges – this is not practical (it would take an infinite amount computational time). We must thus discretize the state space. Thus, for each control and each state variable, we consider 11 uniformly distributed values with a time step of 5 years. As a result, we consider nearly 11
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> states of the world and 11 × 11 policy options for each time step yielding 3.10 × 10
 <sup class="sup">37</sup> (11 × 11
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>) policy options between 2010 and 2100 (18 time steps of 5 years).
