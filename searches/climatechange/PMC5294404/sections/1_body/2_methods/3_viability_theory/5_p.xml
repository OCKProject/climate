<p class="p">It is important to note that in a sequential decision process, the mathematical term “initial states” refers to “present state”, i.e. “now”. That is, the “present state” is the initial state of any decision process into the future. Within the viability kernel, the system can be maintained in a desirable state indefinitely for so long as it is not disturbed - it is, by definition, the set of all the viable states. The computation of a viability kernel also yields the set of controls that maintain the system, the so-called the viable controls.</p>
