<p class="p">As outlined above, our analysis focused on two key thresholds, 350 and 550 ppm by 2100. Here we present the results of the analysis in terms of key attributes of the structure of the control variable and the most important state variables to track in order to remain viable. We will first address the 550 ppm goal followed by the more restrictive 350 ppm target.</p>
