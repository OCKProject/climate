In comparison to the trajectories discussed above, there are none that enables the recovery of 350 ppm in 2100 from the 2010 initial conditions. We explored a doubling and tripling of the capacity of acting (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>) that doubling (or tripling) the capacity to act will provide a gain of around 20 ppm in 2100 because the climate lag makes it difficult to decrease CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref> are required. We therefore consider a scenario with negative emissions by allowing the emission reduction rate 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) to be higher than 1, i.e. we allow 10% negative emissions. This maximum limit for negative emissions is still being debated in the scientific community and estimates vary from 10 to 30 GtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/year
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. We decided to be conservative by choosing 10% in order to allow for a maximum of negative emissions of around 10 GtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/year in 2100. The cost of negative emissions is a topic that is also still being debated (from $10 to $1000 tCO

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref> for more details). For our analysis, we assume that negative emissions have the same costs as abatement costs. Our results (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> done from 10000 simulations) show that it is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality and implement geoengineering technologies (
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) = 1.1) before 2075. After this date, it is not possible to bounce back to 350 ppm by 2100. Between 2045 and 2065, the relative difference of net output is negative in all cases since economic efforts are critical for complying with this planetary boundary by 2100. The date from which negative emissions are effectively introduced significantly influences the results. For instance, if we focus on the trajectories that consider negative emissions only from 2075, carbon neutrality has to be reached by 2050 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, orange area). Indeed, delaying the introduction of such technologies after 2060 considerably reduces the number of viable pathways for recovering 350 ppm. Based on this analysis, access to technology that enables 10% negative emissions and reaching carbon neutrality in 2060 constitutes a clear milestone for the planetary boundary of 350 ppm in 2100. Moreover, so that this milestone will be relevant, it is necessary to get out of the baseline scenario by 2020 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>).
