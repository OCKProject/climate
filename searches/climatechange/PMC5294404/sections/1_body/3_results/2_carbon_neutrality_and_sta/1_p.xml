<p class="p">We analyzed all combinations of the world states from 2010 and 2100 in order to characterize the adaptive policies, for each world state, that enable the planetary system to stay below 550 ppm until 2100. Our computations generated all viable states as a function of time. In order to represent this very large data set for 8 variables, we focus the analysis on the most influential variables for the viability of the system using Sobol indices (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figs 2a</xref>–c and SI). As can be expected, the most significant variables for the viability of the system are the emission reduction rate

Therefore, it is necessary to closely monitor these stocks in order to derive adaptive climate policies with the objective of not crossing the planetary boundary. Note that the economic variable (the world capital stock) is the fourth most important variable (CO

The more we advance in time, the more the Sobol index for the atmospheric carbon stock increases (value triples between 2010 and 2060). This is the result of the fact that unlike the emission control rate, it is easier to control the carbon stock earlier than later. Moreover, the fact that the second order Sobol index
