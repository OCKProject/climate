<p class="p">All scenarios consider carbon neutrality by 2090 unlike 2060 for the temperature-limited scenario and 2235 for the “‘baseline”’ scenario (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). For the 2010 scenario, it is necessary to reach an emission control rate equal to 33% (at least) in 2055, which constitutes a minimum milestone for future climate policy design. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of these futures is not very close to the threshold of 550 ppm by 2100 because the main concern is to limit the carbon peak between 2050 and 2090. This peak can be reduced to 440 ppm (respectively 495 and 538 ppm) for the 2010 scenario (respectively for the 2025 and 2035 scenario). If effective policies are delayed, the peak will be very close to 550 ppm despite greater efforts. The mean increase of emission reduction rate is equal to 71% for the 2035 scenario (respectively 61% for the 2010 scenario) for a minimum CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in 2100 around 455 ppm (respectively around 375 ppm for the 2010 scenario); therefore, efforts are greater for a worse result. In addition, the milestone “33% in 2055” becomes “46% in 2055” because of the lag in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> peak illustrating the importance of thinking of climate targets in terms of trajectories and not in terms of single points, the latter being meaningless in the case of lagged systems such as in the case of climate dynamics. Moreover, there is a risk that additional efforts will not be possible in practice because it is always more difficult to reach major agreements in order to provide significant interventions despite the emergency of the situation (see for instance Copenhagen climate talks in 2009). It is therefore essential to begin immediately, as delay will be costly in terms of achieving climate stabilization goals
