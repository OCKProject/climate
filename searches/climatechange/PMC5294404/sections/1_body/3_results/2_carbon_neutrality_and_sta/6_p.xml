<p class="p">Our results show that estimations of GWP in 2100 are higher (for all scenarios) than the GWP in the baseline scenario because calculated trajectories rely on early total reduction of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (66% of the pathways exhibit a complete reduction of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission to zero in 2055 for the 2010 scenario), involving a relative decrease of GWP in the first years before an increase of this relative difference of GWP from 2060. It follows that the economy will grow faster than in the baseline scenario in the long term due to the benefits from avoiding climate change. As is almost always the case with the management of common-pool resources, during the transient period away from the inefficient trajectory (overuse) to the efficient trajectory, there is an immediate negative impact of use reduction (in our case an emission reduction yielding a lower CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration). Eventually, use reduction generates net benefits which, in our case, occur by 2100 (see
