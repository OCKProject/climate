 </inline-formula>, set to 1. The shape of the viability set (red blocks) is most strongly impacted by the emission reduction rate. But, for low values of the control rate, the shape of the viability kernel is more strongly influenced by carbon stocks. The minimum value of the emission reduction rate (for any state of the world) increases with time to 0.8 in 2060 (in the case of a value of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere close to 550 ppm in 2060, see the lower boundary of the viability set in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2f</xref>). The main idea here is that even if the viable set is significant in the present, this set shrinks considerably (the volume of the red solid decreases) over time. However, the extent of this shrinking depends on the maximum capacity to act

 </inline-formula>. If we consider the viable states in 2010, our results illustrate a trade-off between immediate reduction and progressive reduction according to time (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2g,h and i</xref>): we need an immediate emission reduction rate of around 33% for

 </inline-formula> = 0.2 (see the lower boundary of the viability set on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2h</xref>). Therefore, regardless of future climate policies, considering an immediate massive reduction of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions will enable a lower effort in the future. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2i</xref>, the number of viable states (expressed in % according to the analysis set) that comply with the planetary boundary of 550 ppm is represented for different values of this capacity of acting

 </inline-formula> = 1. Therefore, the value of increased capacity to act is highly nonlinear and exhibits decreasing marginal returns – we should not overestimate the value of a large capacity to reduce emissions in the future relative to reducing emissions now. In addition, the viability of the system decreases until around 2075–2080; if the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is below 550 ppm around this time, it is then easier to maintain this concentration until 2100 because the peak atmospheric carbon concentration has been limited and the main emission reduction effort has already been done.
