<p id="Par2" class="p">Emerging zoonotic diseases account for close to 13% of known human pathogens (Taylor et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2005</xref>). These diseases along with other emerging pathogens that affect crops and domestic animals can have extensive socio-economic consequences (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>), especially when they adapt to and transmit among their new hosts (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2001</xref>). Four diseases that have spilled over from bats to humans and have resulted in epidemics are Ebola and Marburg viruses in Africa (Leroy et al.
