<p id="Par3" class="p">Hendra virus (HeV, Paramyxoviridae:
 <italic class="italic">Henipavirus</italic>) is another bat-borne virus that spills over into domestic animals, in its case horses, and then people with high case fatality rates of 50â€“75% (Halpin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2011</xref>; Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2014</xref>; Edson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2015</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). It was discovered in 1994 in a Brisbane suburb in Queensland, Australia, with two of the four Australian mainland flying fox species, 
 <italic class="italic">Pteropus alecto</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>, as its major reservoir hosts (Halpin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2011</xref>; Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2014</xref>; Edson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2015</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>), although antibodies against HeV are commonly found in 
 <italic class="italic">P. scapulatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. poliocephalus</italic> (Young et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">1996</xref>; Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2008</xref>). HeV is closely related to Nipah virus, which is also a 
 <italic class="italic">Henipavirus</italic> from pteropodid bats. Nipah virus occurs in east Asia and spills over to pigs and humans, where it has been able to cause epidemic disease outbreaks with case fatality rates close to 41% in humans (Chong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2002</xref>; Chua 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2003</xref>). In Bangladesh, spillover occurs directly to humans with even higher case fatality rates (Luby et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2009</xref>). The proven ability of henipaviruses to cause epidemic outbreaks with high case fatality rates make spillover mitigation highly necessary.
