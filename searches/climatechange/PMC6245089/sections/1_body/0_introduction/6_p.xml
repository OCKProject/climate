<p id="Par7" class="p">In order to be able to predict the consequences of climate change, models must rely on climatic data that can be projected into the future, such as those resulting from global circulation models (Hijmans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2005</xref>; Beaumont et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2008</xref>; Wiens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2009</xref>). Empirical evidence suggests that HeV spillover is related to climate by several different mechanisms acting at different temporal and spatial scales. From broad to fine: the spatial and temporal abundance patterns of HeV reservoir hosts, flying foxes, are related to climatic suitability (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>); the spatial dynamics of bats are largely governed by food resources that are dependent on climate (Hudson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>; Giles et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>); the levels of HeV shedding may be linked to low food productivity and availability after severe weather events (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2008</xref>; McFarlane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2011</xref>; PÃ¡ez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>; Peel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2017</xref>); and lastly HeV survival in microclimates which might facilitate indirect transmission, is also dependent on climate (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>).
