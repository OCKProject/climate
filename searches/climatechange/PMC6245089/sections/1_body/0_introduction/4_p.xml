<p id="Par5" class="p">One approach to identify areas at risk from emerging infectious diseases is to model the ecological niche of the causal agent and its reservoir host with spatiality explicit climatic data, and to use the model to predict their geographic distribution (Escobar and Craft 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2016</xref>). The process of niche modelling consists of relating the climatic conditions of locations where organisms are able to breed and persist with the prevailing climatic conditions of areas where species could occur (Soberón et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2005</xref>). The relationships between a species’ presence and climate are usually established with statistical models that ultimately represent a measure of environmental suitability. The spatial representation of environmental suitability helps visualisation of the model’s estimates in the form of maps (Peterson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2006</xref>). Assuming that the organisms’ niches being modelled do not undergo a climatic niche shift, models can be used to predict future distributions under climate change scenarios (Pearman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2008</xref>). For instance, using these methods many diseases have been predicted to impact wider areas with climate change, expanding or shifting from tropical to subtropical areas (Lafferty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>). Therefore, identifying areas at risk and anticipating the potential impacts of climate change on HeV spillover is critical to adequately allocate resources and mitigate risk.
