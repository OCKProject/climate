<p id="Par6" class="p">Ecological niche modelling has been applied with varying degrees of success to investigate the distribution of the zoonotic niches of bat-borne viruses. For instance when Peterson et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2004</xref>) initially predicted areas at risk of Marburg disease spillover in Africa, left out wide areas that were later on shown to be at risk in updated models with improved methods and data (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2006</xref>; Pigott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>). Previous ecological niche modelling studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Henipavirus</italic> spillover systems have focused on answering ecological and epidemiological questions (Hahn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>), identifying reservoir hosts (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>); identifying new populations at risk (Walsh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2015</xref>); or generating broad predictions of risk (Daszak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2013</xref>). While their contribution towards improving our understanding has been valuable, none have focused on forecasting areas at risk of spillover in time, which is essential to anticipate the effects of climate change and inform public health measures (Braks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>).
