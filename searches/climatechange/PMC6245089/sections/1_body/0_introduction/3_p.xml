<p id="Par4" class="p">Mitigation and prevention of impacts of disease spillover depends on our understanding of the transmission process and ability to predict it (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). Mechanistic models of infectious diseases have proven useful frameworks to make informed decisions towards controlling and mitigating the impacts of epidemics (Wickwire 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">1977</xref>). These methods require high-quality longitudinal data rarely available for pathogens that originate in wild animals (Woodroffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">1999</xref>).The poor understanding of HeV dynamics in bats (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>) limit our ability to directly predict HeV levels in those populations. Nevertheless, prediction can be made with alternative methods to mechanistic models at lower spatial and temporal resolutions. These methods are based on readily available data and can be used to model the response of the system of interest (Peterson
