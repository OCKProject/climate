<p id="Par27" class="p">Both models converged with 10 M iterations, burn in of 1 M and thinning rate of 9 K. Both models performed better than random based on their respective performance metrics. The 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> HeV spillover system had an area under the curve ratio of 1.47 that was significantly different from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>= 0.04, 1 represents the random prediction threshold) with an omission rate of 20% consistent with the threshold to calculate the exceeding probabilities. The 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> spillover system that was tested with the jackknife test also performed better than random with a prediction rate of 0.75 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup>). Given that we were looking for a 20% omission threshold and a small number of presence points in the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> data set, the prediction rate of 0.75 is acceptable, because in a binomial process with the same sample size it is not significantly different from 0.8 (
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>= 0.99).
