 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> (
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>). For the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> system, we could successfully implement the best model according to the AIC of the Poisson regression. However, for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system all attempts to include linear and quadratic terms or their interactions resulted in either singularity of the covariance matrix or in very long MCMC chains. As a result, we sought to keep a balance between AIC and the convergence properties of the MCMC chain which resulted in a simple model of linear terms of the climatic components and a cubic term of 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> climatic suitability. Estimates of the regression coefficients (β) and spatial component (φ, σ) are listed in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>.
