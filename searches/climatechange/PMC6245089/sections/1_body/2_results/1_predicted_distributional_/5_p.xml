<p id="Par25" class="p">With respect to 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>, models predicted both expansion and contraction but with low agreement between climate change scenarios (left panels Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The northernmost end of areas at risk were predicted to shrink in both concentration pathways, although these areas were affected by extrapolation. Other small areas were predicted to become unsuitable in RCP 85 that were not affected by extrapolation. Both scenarios, RCP 85 and 45, predict lower probabilities of exceeding the intensity threshold compared with current climate scenarios (right panels in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The areas that experienced no change for 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> were small, and compared with 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> they experienced either no change or expansion (darkest blue Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). This indicates that 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> habitat is likely to shrink and become more suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto,</italic> which raises concerns over 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> conservation measures that might also affect HeV epidemiology.
