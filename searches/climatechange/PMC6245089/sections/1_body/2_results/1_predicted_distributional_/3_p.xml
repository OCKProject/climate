<p id="Par23" class="p">In northern areas, there is consensus that there could be greater risk levels in novel areas in the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> spillover system. However, most of these areas could face novel climatic conditions that would result in model extrapolation, which increases uncertainty (top right corner of right panels in Fig.Â

The only areas with 100% agreement to become completely free of risk are most likely over predictions because they lie very far from the known distribution of spillover and
