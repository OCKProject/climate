<p id="Par21" class="p">The predicted spatial patterns of HeV spillover risk under present climatic conditions for both reservoir host systems, 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>, are consistent with the distribution of spillover events since 1994. Current risk, as explained by 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic>, comprises most of the east coast of Australia, from northern Queensland to central New South Wales, and overlaps with parts of the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>. Additional areas spanning farther north than the northernmost known spillover event were also predicted to be at risk (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Risk driven by 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> resulted in novel areas predicted to be at risk of spillover, located in the northernmost location within Australia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
