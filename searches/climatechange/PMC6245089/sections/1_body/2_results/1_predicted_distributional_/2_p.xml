<p id="Par22" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> HeV spillover system, when we projected the models to future climate change scenarios in 2050, all 16 scenarios agree that there could be an expansion of risk towards the south and slightly farther inland (red areas in left panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). At current horse population levels (estimated during the census 2007–2011), the areas predicted to experience significantly greater risk under climate change scenario RCP45 (greenhouse gas representative concentration pathway 45) contain up to 112 914 horses, and 164 391 horses for RCP85. These numbers represent a 175–260% increase in the horse population at risk. The majority of horses at increased risk occur over 390–425 km of coastline south of the southernmost known spillover event (Kempsey, Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Expansion of risk under both RCPs reaches the Hunter Valley (west of Sydney) which has a high density of horses. The climate change scenario agreement in this area is very high. Despite the increased geographical extent of spillover risk model projections predicted average lower probability of exceeding the specified intensity threshold for spillover to occur (20th quantile of median intensity at spillover locations) compared with current conditions (Figs.
