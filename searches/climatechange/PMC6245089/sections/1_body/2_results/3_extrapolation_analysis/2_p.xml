<p id="Par30" class="p">Extrapolation affecting the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system was mostly present in areas accessible to the species, but that are outside the areas estimated as suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>. Therefore, extrapolation is unlikely to affect predictions save for northernmost locations in the study area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, some climate change scenarios predict the occurrence of extrapolation type 1 and 2 likely caused by 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>. Probability of extrapolation for this system is shown in the top right corner of the right side panels in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>.
