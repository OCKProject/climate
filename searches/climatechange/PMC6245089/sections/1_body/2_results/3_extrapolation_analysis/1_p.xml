<p id="Par29" class="p">All future climate scenarios result in novel conditions for the models especially in northern areas. Extrapolation affected mostly the projections of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> HeV spillover system and occurred in the novel areas in northern Queensland (top right corner of the right side panels Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). All the climatic variables used in the model caused type 1 novelty in these areas. Type 1 novelty is an increased range of values than used in model training. Additional areas of extrapolation occurred in southern locations along the coast. Because extrapolation in these areas was caused by the model of 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> distribution, which can only have values 0–1, extrapolation artefacts are unlikely. We did not perform an extrapolation analysis for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> distribution models, but only compared the predictions of Maxent models fit with and without clamping and extrapolation and did not notice any differences.
