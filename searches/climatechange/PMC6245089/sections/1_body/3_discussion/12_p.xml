<p id="Par42" class="p">In light of the potentially larger horse population at risk, it is clear that direct intervention of the HeV spillover system is necessary to mitigate risk in response to climate change such as extending vaccine coverage regardless of the uncertainties involved (Beaumont et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, a more holistic approach would include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Such a management strategy would positively impact all levels of organisation of the HeV spillover system studied here and prevent other predicted consequences of climate change. For instance, the Australian tropics are predicted to experience large biodiversity losses (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2003</xref>) and grasslands in southern Australia could experience increased variability in productivity which could affect the cattle and potentially the horse industry (Cullen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2009</xref>).
