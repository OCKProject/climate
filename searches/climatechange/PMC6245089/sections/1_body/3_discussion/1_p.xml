<p id="Par31" class="p">Under climate change, suitability for HeV spillover could expand southwards. In addition to a southward expansion, some scenarios predicted inland expansion in the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> HeV spillover system. However, while the total area at risk of spillover was predicted to increase, the average probability of spillover in these areas could slightly decrease, especially in the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system. There was high uncertainty of future risk in areas north of the current distribution of spillover. In areas currently inhabited by 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus, P. alecto</italic> was predicted to remain stable or expand. In areas where both 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> were predicted to co-occur, average probability of exceeding the intensity threshold was predicted to decrease with respect to both species. 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic>’s expansion indicates that additional mitigation efforts should be allocated where risk has been predicted to increase (marked as red in the consensus maps in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In addition, the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> into 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> territory suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> may replace or become the more predominant HeV host in those areas.
