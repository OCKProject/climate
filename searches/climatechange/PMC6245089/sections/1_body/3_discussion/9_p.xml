<p id="Par39" class="p">The cause of predicted expansions under climate change with high agreement might be related to the higher temperatures expected at higher altitude and lower latitudes (Lafferty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>), particularly in Australia (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2003</xref>). This is consistent with the predictions of tropical diseases expanding or shifting into subtropical areas (Lafferty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>). The lower agreement on the inland expansion indicates that the effect of altitude is less clear among climate change scenarios. In fact, some of the scenarios indicate that there could be a contraction towards the coast. Consequently, to adequately assess if there will be expansion or contraction to and from the coast, flying fox monitoring programs are required.
