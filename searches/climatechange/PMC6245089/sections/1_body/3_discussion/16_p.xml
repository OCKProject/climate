<p id="Par46" class="p">The strength of our approach lies in its generality. Possible improvements to our models to make them more specific might involve: (1) including a model of bat distribution that better accounts for the effect of urbanisation (Tait et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2014</xref>); (2) including other biological interactions that are crucial for bat species (Giles et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>) that can be transferred to climate change scenarios; and (3) establishing direct links between climatic factors and the levels of HeV infection in bats. Such an analysis would likely result in smaller areas and populations predicted to be at risk.
