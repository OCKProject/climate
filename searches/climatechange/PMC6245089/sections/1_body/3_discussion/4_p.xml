<p id="Par34" class="p">Poisson point processes have infrequently been used to model the spatial pattern of spillover of bat-borne viruses. Walsh (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2015</xref>) modelled the spatial pattern of Nipah virus spillover to humans as a point process model in response to human footprint, the presence of bat reservoirs and environmental factors (vegetation). One key difference with our study is that we focused on modelling HeV spillover driven by environmental factors in order to be able to project the models into climate change scenarios. This enabled us to explore the potential consequences of climate change for HeV spillover. With that in mind we used reservoir host density (statistically equivalent to the human footprint variable in Walsh (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2015</xref>)) as an offset term to specifically model the isolated effect of climate. We decided to take this approach because of the lack of data to predict future horse density and distribution, which precludes its inclusion as a HeV spillover predictor.
