<p id="Par38" class="p">There was complete agreement among climate change scenarios that there could be a southward increase in suitability for spillover caused by the response of 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> to climate change. However, the already observed southward expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> is faster than predicted by changing climate (Roberts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>), suggesting that other non-climatic factors like urbanisation (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2011</xref>; Tait et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2014</xref>) are also affecting the presence and density of the bat species. To date the southernmost recorded spillover events lie within the limits of the current potential distribution of spillover (blue areas in left panels of Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This shows that even when 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> is capable of occupying areas beyond its optimal climatic niche, spillover and spillover risk occur within the areas with the highest climatic suitability in most cases, most likely due to higher potential densities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> [climatic suitability is correlated with bat density and spillover risk (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2014</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>)]. Hence, as climatic suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> continues to increase southwards, potential for higher population densities could increase southwards as well as HeV spillover risk.
