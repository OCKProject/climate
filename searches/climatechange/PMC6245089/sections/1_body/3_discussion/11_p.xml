<p id="Par41" class="p">The ultimate implications of the southward and probable inland expansion are a greater number of horses at spillover risk. Depending on the representative concentration pathway (RCP), and based on the 2007 horse census, there could be at least 112–165,000 more horses at risk (175–260% increase). Because there is considerable uncertainty around the potential outcomes of climate change on disease occurrence in new areas more research is needed, first to verify predictions and then to better manage the consequences (Braks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>). Furthermore, the ultimate spillover risk scenario by 2050 will also depend on horse densities and socio-economic processes, and how these processes interact with climate change. Therefore, one potential area of ecological and epidemiological research is the role of novel ecological interactions between flying foxes and other organisms such as food sources that could experience distributional shifts and impacts as result of human activities. We need to understand if these novel interactions and processes affect the dynamics of bat populations, HeV, and spillover risk (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2003</xref>; Sala et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2009</xref>). Consequently, we emphasise the need to undertake regular risk assessments to quantify HeV exposure in horse populations and to consider the potential consequences of a larger horse population at risk.
