 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2013</xref>) have used machine learning methods. Interpretation of these models and the risk management implications of the predictions were thus limited to visual analysis of the geographic patterns and associated climatic factors. The transparent nature and control over model selection that Poisson point processes confer result in better understanding of the likely biological meaning of statistical associations (Renner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2015</xref>; Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, definitive interpretation is dependent on understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms (Walsh
