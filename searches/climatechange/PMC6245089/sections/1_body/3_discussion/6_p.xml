<p id="Par36" class="p">Although the final models are complex due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of flying foxes and horses, the statistical associations in the models of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> system are similar with those found in Martin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2018</xref>). First, most of the variables’ interactions that were kept in the model represent rainfall (
 <italic class="italic">bio12</italic>) and its seasonality (
 <italic class="italic">bio15</italic>). These two interact with 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent.p.alecto</italic> indicating that interactions between rainfall, its variability, and the probable presence of this bat species are important for spillover. Such effects could be due to the climatic differences between areas used for foraging and establishing a roost (Tidemann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">1999</xref>; Vardon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2001</xref>). In fact, high suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> is not enough to explain spillover because 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent.p.alecto</italic> alone had a negative effect which is reversed when it interacts with rainfall levels (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We can infer from these associations that rainfall levels and their variability with respect to seasonal extremes could be broad-scale correlates of HeV spillover risk (Páez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2017</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2018</xref>).
