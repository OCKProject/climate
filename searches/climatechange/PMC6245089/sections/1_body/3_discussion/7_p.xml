<p id="Par37" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system, the small number of spillover events, nine, limits the number of variables and their interactions that could be included in the model. From the final model structure only 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent.p.conspicillatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">bio2</italic> (mean diurnal temperature range) had significant effects (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Given the cubic exponent affecting the positive effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent.p.conspicillatus</italic>, we infer that transmission from this species to horses occurs in areas where climatic suitability is very high for 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>.
