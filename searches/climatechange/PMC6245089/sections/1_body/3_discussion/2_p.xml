<p id="Par32" class="p">The current forecasted area at risk of HeV spillover to horses is wider than the area that contains the detected HeV spillover events. Based on both 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus,</italic> areas farther north than previously recognised were predicted to be at risk. Absence of spillover detection in these areas is probably due to the very low density of horses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and relative lack of disease surveillance. While the effect of horse density on risk of spillover seems negligible (McFarlane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2011</xref>) or negative depending on the spatial scale (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2018</xref>), the presence of horses is conditional for spillover (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>).
