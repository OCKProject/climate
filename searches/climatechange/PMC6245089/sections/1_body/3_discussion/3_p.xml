<p id="Par33" class="p">Previous niche modelling studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Henipavirus</italic> hosts predicted broad areas at risk in Australia (Daszak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our results differ from these predictions because we used the actual spillover events to fit the model and because we narrowed down the number of reservoir hosts from four to two. Before 2014 it was unclear which bat species were more relevant for HeV epidemiology. Recent findings have provided epidemiological (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2014</xref>; Edson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2015</xref>), and ecological (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>) support for 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> as the main HeV reservoir hosts. Hence, we have predicted smaller areas at risk.
