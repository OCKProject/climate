 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). These could be due to the inclusion of areas that are not usually available to

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2005</xref>). Accessible areas are usually defined by physical barriers, however, in the absence of such evident barriers for pteropodid bats in Australia we assumed that climate could act as a barrier through its effects on bat physiology. While the assumption could be valid, the choice of climatic regions clearly did not eliminate inaccessible areas that could be suitable, at least according to some climatic factors. Alternatively, the most relevant climatic factors that restrict the distribution of bats and HeV spillover might have been discarded in the search for variables that were less likely to impact the model’s transference to climate change scenarios (Owens et al.
