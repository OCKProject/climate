<p id="Par47" class="p">Spillover of diseases from wild to domestic animals and humans comprises several levels of ecological organisation. The first level includes the distribution of the reservoir host, and then the distribution of the causal agent within the reservoir host (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). By including the additional layer of spillover host distribution as an offset during model fit, we have modelled the direct effect of climate (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2015</xref>) on the biological processes that affect the reservoir and the causal agent and result in HeV spillover. Therefore, the models represent the underlying risk to any spillover hosts present in the areas predicted to be at risk due to the presence of the reservoir host and the effects of climate on the HeV spillover system. The 20% omission threshold indicates that within these areas at least 80% of spillover cases could occur. The precise location and timing of spillover cases will depend on processes that occur at finer scales like the fraction of susceptible horses (e.g. unvaccinated) that are effectively exposed (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>). Consequently the models should only be used to improve understanding of spillover risk, identify areas to allocate resources for mitigation and inform research activities.
