<p id="Par43" class="p">Our models predicted that spillover frequency could decrease in response to climate change with respect to 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>. However, the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> HeV spillover system was predicted to remain or increase within the current areas suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>. Therefore, these areas of tropical north Queensland could experience a replacement of reservoir host species that may result in different epidemiological processes that would benefit from different mitigation strategies. We recommend, therefore, that an area of research be the development of specific management strategies for the different flying fox species relevant to Hendra virus spillover. These management strategies would anticipate and better manage flying fox speciesâ€™ replacements and changes in the epidemiology of HeV spillover.
