<p id="Par9" class="p">Ecological niche models often use presence only data, resulting in the extensive use of algorithmic modelling (Elith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2011</xref>). A well-known disadvantage of these methods is their potential for complexity. Recent efforts have made the application of better understood techniques like generalised linear models possible for presence only data, in the form of Poisson point process models (Renner and Warton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2013</xref>; Renner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2015</xref>). Taking advantage of these statistically transparent frameworks, we modelled the risk of HeV spillover as a Poisson point process, including a log-Gaussian Cox process to model spatial autocorrelation in a Bayesian hierarchical inference framework. This method allowed us to use the entire HeV spillover database (55 events between 1994 and 2015) without thinning to control spatial autocorrelation (Diggle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2013</xref>; Boria et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2014</xref>). The models represent the relationship between the number of spillover events per unit area, the climatic suitability for reservoir host species, and the climatic niche (temperature and precipitation) over which spillover events have occurred to date.
