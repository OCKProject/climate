<p id="Par17" class="p">The horse population density model was built with the horse population census of 2007 (Moloney 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>). This horse density model was created by introducing uniformly distributed noise to the geographical coordinates of the horse properties, equivalent to 50% of the cell width of the environmental data. The number of horses per grid cell after noising the coordinates was rasterised, and the process was repeated 100 times. When iterations were completed, the 100 raster layers were averaged to create the final horse density model (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This method allowed us to account for the effect of properties spanning more than one grid cell but whose centroid lied within a single pixel.
