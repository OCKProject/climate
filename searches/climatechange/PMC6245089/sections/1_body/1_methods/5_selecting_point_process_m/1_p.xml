<p id="Par15" class="p">Parameters for the Poisson point process model and spatial autocorrelation with a log-Gaussian Cox process were sampled with a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm implemented in the R 3.2.3 ‘lgcp’ package (Taylor et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2016</xref>). Model selection was performed a priori with a Poisson regression (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2013</xref>). The response variable for this part of the process was the number of points per spatial area unit (e.g. pixels). We began model selection with four model structures for the Poisson regression of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> system; interactions between all explanatory variables; with linear, quadratic and cubic terms; and linear and quadratic terms and a series of interactions between linear, squared and cubed terms. Each model was then subject to automated step-wise variable deletion until we obtained the model with the lowest AIC. We kept the model structure with the lowest AIC. Then we tested the performance of this model structure on independent data with the partial ROC test [described in more detail below (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2008</xref>)]. If the lowest AIC model performed better than random according to the test, then we used its formula in the final Poisson point process. For the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system, we only selected one out of three models given the small number of spillover cases potentially arising from this species—all linear terms, and linear with quadratic and cubed probability of 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> presence (from Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>).
