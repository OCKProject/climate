<p id="Par14" class="p">The expected intensity of spillover cases per spatial unit was explained by the climatic suitability for the two key reservoir hosts previously modelled with Maxent (Phillips et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2006</xref>) by Martin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>), and a subset of the Worldclim bioclimatic variables (bio1-19) (Hijmans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2005</xref>). To select the explanatory bioclimatic variables less likely to negatively affect model transference to climate change conditions for each spillover system, we performed a Niche views procedure. It consists of an analysis of the correlations between pairs of explanatory variables and the location of the presence points within the bivariate clouds of data points [BIO1-18 and 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> models (Owens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>)]. The variables less likely to affect model transference to climate change conditions are those where the presence points lie close to the centre or relatively far from the margins of the range of values within the bivariate cloud of data (Owens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>). This may have increased model complexity by excluding variables with more explanatory power.
