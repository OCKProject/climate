<p id="Par13" class="p">Point process models relate the number of points (intensity) of presence locations to spatial units. Before a model was fitted, we needed to determine the optimal size of the spatial units in which spillover intensity would be regressed against a set of explanatory variables. To estimate the optimal computational resolution, we used a minimum contrast method. Briefly, this method consists of comparing the bandwidth of a nonparametric field and the theoretical model that describes the spatial process of the data (Davies and Hazelton
