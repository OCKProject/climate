<p id="Par12" class="p">To assign spillover events to either system (
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic>, north and south, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic>, strictly north), we extracted the Maxent modelâ€™s relative probability of presence of the two flying fox species at the location of spillover (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). The location points were assigned to the relevant reservoir host system based on a higher relative probability of presence value for that species. To this data, from the remaining location points that did not have greater occurrence probability for either species, we added the points with the top 5% of occurrence probability (two spillover events) for that species at spillover locations. With this final step, we allowed for ambiguity of the most likely reservoir species that acted as the source of infection in horses.
