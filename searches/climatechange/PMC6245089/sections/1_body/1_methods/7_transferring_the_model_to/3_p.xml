<p id="Par20" class="p">Models’ predictive performance was measured with the partial ROC (receiver operator characteristic) with a 20% omission rate (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2008</xref>) for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> system, and with a jackknife test (Pearson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2006</xref>) for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system. The partial ROC test is a modification of the traditional ROC area under curve (AUC) that measures a model’s ability to discriminate zeroes from ones. An AUC score of 1 means the model is capable of perfect discrimination (no false positives or negatives). The partial ROC, however, is based on the spatial performance of the model projection by contrasting the percent of area predicted that is used to generate a random predictor with the proportion of presences predicted. The resulting score is the quotient of the model’s AUC and the random predictor’s AUC. Consequently, the maximum partial ROC score is two (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2008</xref>). To run this test with independent data, we partitioned the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alecto</italic> system data in four sets and cross-validated their predictions with models fit in one chain of 5 M iterations, burn-in of 500 K and thinning of 4.5 K. We allowed the partial ROC test a 20% omission of the test points to represent the 20% uncertainty in spillover location according to the Biosecurity Queensland dataset. While desirable, a higher number of partitions was not possible due to the high computational intensity of these analyses. For the 
 <italic class="italic">P. conspicillatus</italic> system, we fitted 8 models, each one omitting one of the spillover presence points. Then we calculated the minimum thresholds and their corresponding per cent of area predicted for the jackknife test (Pearson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2006</xref>).
