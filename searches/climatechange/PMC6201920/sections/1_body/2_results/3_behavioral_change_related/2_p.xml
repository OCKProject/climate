<p class="p">Through ordinal logistic regression, we determined the effects of the same set of demographic variables plus climate change knowledge and concern on the likelihood that students would report higher levels of behavioral change in response to climate change. Knowledge and concern emerged as the key predictors. Surprisingly, knowledge showed a slight negative relationship with behavioral change: students with lower scores reported more behavioral change while students with higher scores reported less behavioral change. Concern, as expected, showed a strong positive relationship with reported level of behavioral change. The best fitting model included both hometown region and student major. However, these two variables were only marginally significant. Students from the south reported the highest levels of change; students from eastern Taiwan were significantly less likely to report change than students from the south. Odds ratios appear in
