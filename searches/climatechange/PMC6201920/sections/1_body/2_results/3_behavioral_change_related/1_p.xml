 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206298.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The degree of behavioral change differed significantly based on household income (however, post hoc Dunn pairwise comparisons failed to identify significant differences between income categories), student major area (social science students reported significantly higher levels of behavioral change than both humanities and science and technology students) and university ranking (students from low and middle tier universities reported significantly higher levels of behavioral change than did students at the highest tier universities). Detailed results are provided in Table D in
