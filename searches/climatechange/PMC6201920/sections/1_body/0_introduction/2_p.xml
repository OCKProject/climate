<p class="p">Responding to these potential dangers will require massive, sustained mitigation efforts to reduce growth in greenhouse gas levels, and adaptation efforts to respond to the impacts. Public support will be essential for the changes required. In recent decades, researchers have tracked trends in public knowledge about and perception of climate change. However, this literature has disproportionately focused on Western countries, particularly the United States. Far less research has appeared on East Asia, a region currently responsible for nearly 35% of global CO

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>; in this article, East Asia refers to China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan). East Asian countries all have large, export-oriented industrial sectors and high levels of per capita emissions (
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Further, these economies have failed to significantly reduce emissions, with climate policy for all of them being graded “poor” or “very poor” in the Germanwatch 2018 climate change performance index [

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] implies that East Asia will need to reduce emissions related to both production and consumption. What role will public perceptions related to climate change play in the success or failure of this transition? International comparative studies of public attitudes indicate that generalizations about East Asia cannot be made from studies of Western countries [
