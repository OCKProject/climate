<p class="p">The present study seeks to help answer such questions by summarizing key findings from a broader investigation of attitudes towards climate change in Taiwan. Recent studies in Taiwan suggest that a high degree of concern about climate change exists in the adult population [

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Taiwan’s policymakers have increasingly turned to education to promote sustainable development, culminating in the Environmental Education Act in 2011 [

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Are these efforts bearing fruit in terms of student risk perception? In this paper, we investigate the relationships between climate change literacy, concern and behavioral change among university students. The longer time horizon of students makes them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and, from a threat-reduction perspective, students form a critical target population as they are at a stage at which lifelong habits related to mitigation and adaptation are being formed. In Taiwan, this population is particularly relevant, as about 71% of people in this age group attend tertiary education [

As the next generation of citizens and consumers, a better understanding of their attitudes will also help in forecasting future trends. Surprisingly few studies have attempted to assess the knowledge and attitudes of university students towards climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and none have attempted to sample across all majors and degrees, much less across a country. Further, many used small samples (under 400) and/or were designed to respond to challenges faced in Western countries, particularly the need for education to overcome climate change denialism [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Ours is the first study to cover knowledge, concern and behavioral change in a single investigation and to include students from across all majors and degrees, across all years of university study, across universities ranked at different levels and across all geographical regions. In this study, we seek to identify the relationships between climate change knowledge, concern and behavioral change, as well as to determine whether social background factors influence these variables.
