<p class="p">With continued economic development, our best proxies for understanding the likely trajectory of emissions in China come from other East Asian countries. Taiwan, closest culturally to China, is a case of special interest. With its energy-intensive industrial base, Taiwan is responsible for nearly 1% of global emissions and has one of the highest levels of per capita emissions in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Taiwan has set a target of reducing emissions by 50% of the 2005 level by 2050. However, Taiwan’s reliance on industry and its decision to close its remaining nuclear reactors (generating 18% of Taiwan’s electricity as of 2016) by 2025, means that meeting this goal will require significant increases in energy efficiency and reduced consumption [
