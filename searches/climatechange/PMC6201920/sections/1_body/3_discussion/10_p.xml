<p class="p">We further suggest that Taiwan is one instance of a broader East Asian model, the key feature of which is the commanding role of the “developmental state” [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which contrasts sharply with the “regulatory state” in countries like the US and the UK. In the US, the conflict between economic interests and the environment has played out in the political sphere. Vested economic interests funded efforts to generate doubt about climate change and thereby hinder or prevent policy responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. As a result, educators, left on the defensive and forced to focus on techniques to convey accurate information, are still struggling to raise awareness and concern prior to instilling environmentally friendly habits. In East Asia, by contrast, public opinion is often disregarded and the conflict between vested economic interests and the environment is played out not in the political sphere but rather as inter-ministerial disputes 
 <italic class="italic">within</italic> governments. With the exception of China’s coal exports, the East Asian economies are also oil, LNG and coal importers, with no significant fossil fuel producing interests. For these reasons, active private-sector disinformation campaigns are not a factor. This explains the finding, paradoxical from a western perspective, of populations knowledgeable and concerned about climate change but economies still locked into high levels of emissions. The resulting discrepancy between government-sponsored education and recommendations (made by ministries of education and the environment) and actual government policies on the environment (shaped by ministries responsible for economic policy) may also lead to a lack of trust in government [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] which could partially explain the lack of behavioral change found in this study. It raises the further point that opposition to environmentally damaging policies will necessarily take a different form in East Asia, as discussed and illustrated in Chou’s recent discussion of the 2010–11 movement to stop the construction of a naphtha cracking plant in Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Given the central importance of East Asia to the problem of climate change, we feel that future research should continue to focus on the specific dynamics of policy formation and the role of public attitudes in the region, without assuming similarity to western norms.
