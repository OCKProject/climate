<p class="p">Based on this literature, we were surprised to find no relationship between knowledge and concern and a negative relationship between knowledge and behavioral change in the present study. One possibility is that a positive relationship does exist across an entire society or when comparing different societies, where knowledge levels vary widely. In our sample of university students in Taiwan, where climate change education is part of the curriculum, a basic level of knowledge existed across the sample as indicated by the absence of differences by region. Given this basic level, further increases in knowledge may no longer predict increases in concern or behavioral change. In Taiwan, 70.9% of the relevant population moved on to tertiary education in 2015 [
