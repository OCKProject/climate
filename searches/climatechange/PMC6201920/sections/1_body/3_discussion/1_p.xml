<p class="p">This paper investigated the relationships between climate change knowledge, the degree of concern and reported behavioral change in response to climate change among 1118 university students in Taiwan. The level of concern towards climate change is high amongst Taiwanese students but only moderate levels of behavioral change were reported. In terms of demographics, students from higher ranked universities scored significantly higher on the knowledge quiz, while students from households in the lowest income category scored significantly lower. However, knowledge was not a predictor of concern and was actually a 
 <italic class="italic">negative</italic> predictor of behavioral change. The degree of concern was mainly predicted by student hometown region (students from the south and east reported being more concerned) and by student major (social science students reported being more concerned). The level of concern, in turn, was the strongest predictor of actual behavioral change. These results suggest that lack of knowledge is not an obstacle to behavioral change. Further, although greater concern predicts higher levels of behavioral change, the high degree of concern found in Taiwan has not, as of yet, translated into correspondingly high levels of behavioral change, a result consistent with an earlier study of Taiwanâ€™s adult population [

The university years, especially in Taiwan where a high percentage of students attend university, may represent an ideal opportunity.
