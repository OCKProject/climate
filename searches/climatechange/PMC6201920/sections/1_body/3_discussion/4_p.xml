<p class="p">We propose two hypotheses to explain the 
 <italic class="italic">negative</italic> knowledge-behavior change relationship found in our study. First, it may have resulted from the 
 <italic class="italic">positive</italic> relationship between family income and knowledge combined with the 
 <italic class="italic">negative</italic> relationship between family income and behavioral change (Tables A and D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206298.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The latter relationship may be due to a feeling of greater vulnerability to extreme weather events among lower income students or it may be that lower income students view the behavioral changes reported in this study as money-saving. Second, there might be a threshold at which more education counter-productively increases feelings of helplessness by increasing the understanding that responses to climate change require society-wide programs, rather than changes to individual behavior. Further research could usefully explore the relationship between knowledge and concern/behavioral change across the entire range of knowledge levels.
