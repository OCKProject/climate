<p class="p">This study did not use a representative sample. 
 <xref rid="pone.0206298.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> compares the characteristics of our sample with those of the student population in Taiwan. Interpretations of our results should thus be made with appropriate caution. Also, our study was based on self-reported levels of concern and changes in behavior and these responses are subject to biases (e.g., social desirability bias). Finally, as our data was cross-sectional, we cannot make strong causal claims concerning the correlations found here, although we hope that our regression analyses have shed light on the possible relations underlying our findings.
