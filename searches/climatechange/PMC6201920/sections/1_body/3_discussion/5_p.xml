<p class="p">Turning to concern, a further significant finding of our study is that a strong positive relationship did appear between concern and behavioral change. In Taiwan, concern is high, and it correlates with behavioral change. This must be regarded as an achievement of Taiwan’s educational program around climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0206298.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, some significant differences in concern were found based on our demographic variables. First, students expressing higher concern levels were more likely to come from southern and eastern Taiwan, regions with higher levels of exposure to weather-related hazards (although no major extreme weather events were recorded in Taiwan during the period of our study). Storms typically originate to the southeast of Taiwan, between the Caroline Islands and the Philippines, with an average three to four storms occurring between July and October. The presence of a mountain range running from the north to south serves as a natural barrier lessening the impact of these storms on the western part of the island. Among Taiwan’s adult population, Sun and Han found that direct experience of weather-related disasters was not associated with climate change risk perception. However, more general typhoon-related anxiety was related to perceived risks towards climate change [
