<p class="p">Participants were asked to report their gender, household income in New Taiwan Dollars (NTD), hometown region, mother and father’s level of education, student (personal) education, student major area, student political party; university ranking was also included as a variable (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206298.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). Mother’s level of education was used as it displayed a stronger relationship to the outcome variables than did father’s level of education. We collapsed student majors into the three broad categories used by Taiwan’s Ministry of Education: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Science and Technology. However, we subsequently created a fourth category for “Cosmetic and Beauty Science,” (originally included in the Science and Technology category) following a review of the curricular content of this major. For political affiliation, students were asked to indicate the political party they most identified with. In Taiwan, political parties are often discussed in terms of the ‘pan-Blue’ and ‘pan-Green’ camps, divided primarily by their attitudes toward relations with China. The parties of the pan-Blue camp—the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People’s First Party (PFP)—tend to prefer close Taiwan-China relations with re-unification as an eventual goal while the pan-Green parties—the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and New Power Party (NPP) tend to lean toward pro-independence policies. Note that ‘Green’ here does not have a pro-environment connotation. We refer to Taiwan’s small environment-centered parties as simply ‘Environmental Parties.’ The categories used, and the results are provided in
