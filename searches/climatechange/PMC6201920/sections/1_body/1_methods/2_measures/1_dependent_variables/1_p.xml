<p class="p">Climate-change related knowledge, risk perception and willingness to change behavior among university students in Taiwan was assessed through a three-part Chinese-language (traditional script) questionnaire in June 2016. We conducted a pilot test with 231 participants along with a follow-up series of focus-groups to investigate item quality. The results were used to select the final set of questions included in the questionnaire. Knowledge was measured with fifteen multiple-choice questions covering basic scientific and social aspects of climate change (Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency reliability was marginally acceptable at 0.645; all items are provided in Chinese and English in Supporting Information

To measure risk perception, we asked fourteen questions. In this paper, we present results to the question “How concerned are you, if at all, that global climate change will harm you personally at some point in your lifetime?” given the response options “Very concerned,” “Somewhat concerned,” “Not too concerned,” “Not at all concerned,” “Climate change does not exist,” and “Don’t know.” To measure readiness to make behavioral changes, we asked four questions. In this paper, we present results to the question “How much have you changed your behavior because of climate change—not at all, a little, some or very much?”
