<p class="p">We investigated three dependent variables in the study: (1) climate change knowledge; (2) climate change concern; and (3) behavioral change related to climate change. As climate change knowledge scores were non-normally distributed, and as the other dependent variables analyzed were ordinal, the knowledge scores were transformed into ordinal categories for greater coherence in the treatment of our outcome variables. We first conducted Kruskal-Wallis H tests to assess the effect of each individual explanatory variable on the dependent variables. We then developed ordinal logistic regression models to estimate the effect size of the explanatory variables within integrated models. The best fitting model for each dependent variable was chosen using goodness of fit statistics. All analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical package [
