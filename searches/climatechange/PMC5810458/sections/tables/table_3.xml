I do not drink it, of course, I cannot drink it because it is somewhat contaminated, but I water with it. A normal rainy day, with this last rain, I fill a deposit of 90,000 L. Why architects don’t demand, when they build a house, to make a cistern to collect rainwater? It’s such a simple and easy saving. We’re talking about 90,000 L of water».
