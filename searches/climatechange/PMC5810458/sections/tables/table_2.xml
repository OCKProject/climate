I’m not a specialist, but I guess that there’re things that can be solved with renewable energies if we invest resources as soon as possible». (FG held in San Cristóbal de La Laguna).</td>

So why is Germany, located in the North, already raising such issues when we still seem to be afraid of change? And say, come on, let's change this». (FG held in La Orotava).</td>

Apart from that technological change and that energy model, a reduction of energy consumption is also important, because it is clear that, e.g., today washing machines are more efficient, but now 4 washing machines are sold instead of 1 sold before. (…) The idea that I want to raise is that a change in the energy model and technology in general is super important, it being possible and necessary, but it has to be accompanied by consciousness and reduction of consumption or else there is no useful technology».

And what concerns me the most: the implementation. Because there are plans already». (FG held in San Cristóbal de La Laguna).</td>
