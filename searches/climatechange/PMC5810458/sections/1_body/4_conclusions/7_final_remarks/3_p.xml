<p id="par0325" class="p">Global phenomena do not manifest equally around the planet, so any attempt to deal with CC issues needs to be situated. Involving relevant actors, including citizens means mobilisation of relevant types of knowledge to address in a hopefully lesser contended way the challenges that a changing climate of natural, social, economical and political nature bring today. The futuring angle of the methodology applied in this study was an interesting trigger to wonder about framings, uncertainties, expectations and imaginaries about strategy and action. Finally, we argue that dialogues about CC challenges are not only desirable but actually should be the pillar of any strategic development to address locally what is heralded as a global phenomena, not least because it is unimaginable that any thoughtful, feasible or desirable action can be taken without situated knowledge inputs in “insular” territories.</p>
