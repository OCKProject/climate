<p id="par0320" class="p">The CC adaptation frame seems to be too narrow, especially in contexts characterised by insularity and other specificities. Indeed, the key issues that interested the dialogues about CC adaptation in a way or the other were all related to governance issues, including resources dependencies, unarticulated policies across sectors, disrespect for the islandâ€™s carrying capacity, maladaptation strategies to CC, and inequality. They are all seen as hindering factors to enact useful strategies and action to protect humans and nature in Tenerife. In addition, the lack of symbolic institutions that lead action is considered another caveat towards serious action. The framing of resilience developed during the participatory process seems to be the desirable strategy to enact necessary transformation about those hindering factors.</p>
