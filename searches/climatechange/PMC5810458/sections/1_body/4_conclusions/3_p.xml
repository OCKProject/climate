<p id="par0300" class="p">This study brought insights into relevant institutional arrangements, social actors and desirable strategies to organise and deploy meaningful action against CC events in Tenerife. The participants of the focus groups discussed resilience as the main governance issue rather than focusing on the lack of adaptation strategies to heatwaves or other extreme weather events. In response to the researchersâ€™ framing focused on the threats of those hazards, participants pointed out that making the island resilient to external shocks, be it climatic, economic or political was the issue that needed to be addressed.</p>
