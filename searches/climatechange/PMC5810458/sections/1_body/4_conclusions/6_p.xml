This would imply a societal and governmental commitment towards increasing sovereignty levels. Maladaptation avoidance is clearly linked not only to sovereignty but also to coherent environmental governance. The nexus water-energy-food is relevant here as mitigation measures of CC can lead to increased stresses in energy resources: e.g. more energy for cooling, more desalination of water, etc. The tourism sector is by far the dimension with larger uncertainties. For example, can Tenerife be resilient depending on the tourism sector? Is there something like sustainable tourism? Could 6.4 million touristsâ€™ fly to Tenerife in the post-oil era?
