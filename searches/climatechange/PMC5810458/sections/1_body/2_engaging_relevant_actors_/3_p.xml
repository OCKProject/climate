 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stocker et al. (2012)</xref> carried out a participatory process in the Rottnest Island (Australia), a small island of 19 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 12 km long located 20 km off the cost of Perth. The island is presented as highly vulnerable to coastal erosion and floods, highlighting the need for adaptation strategies. The authors used Google Earth as a tool to engage local stakeholders and identify hotspots around the island. 
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaap et al. (2013)</xref> designed a participatory process to look for adaptation strategies to adapt agricultural production to heatwaves in Flevoland (The Netherlands). Through workshops, farmers and other stakeholders were engaged in order to come up with a list of adaptation actions intended to minimise agricultural disruptions to heatwaves under different warming scenarios. Crop cover, plant and early harvesting as well as drip irrigation were proposed. Lastly, 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sautier et al. (2017)</xref> applied a game-like platform to engage stakeholders in grassland-based farming systems in Aveyron (France). This game, called «Forage Rummy», aims at addressing complex farming management techniques under extreme climate conditions. Thus, farmers were able to test alternative adaptation actions, as well as assess their robustness during workshop sessions, in order to enhance real-life farming decision-making.
