 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tsamalis et al., 2013</xref>) have shown that the dusty, hot and dry SAL typically expands between 1 and 5 km.a.s.l. Atmospheric soundings have shown that during intense events, the SAL occurs above 500 m.a.s.l. over Tenerife, shifting the typical inversion layer associated with the trade winds to lower altitudes and resulting in high temperatures in the forest of the Island that typically occurs between 600 and 1800 m.a.s.l. These high temperatures represent an increased risk of forest fires, whereas the shifting to low altitudes of the inversion layer is typically associated with severe pollution episodes of industrial origin in the metropolitan area, due to the emissions of the oil refinery and shipping in the harbour of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (
