<p id="par0065" class="p">However, in the summer season (July and August) dust events are associated with the circulation of the dusty Saharan Air Layer (SAL) – i.e. the hot and dry airstream that expands from North Africa to the Americas – over the Canary Islands. The SAL results in hot, dry and dusty air between 500 m.a.s.l. and 5 km.a.s.l. above the Canary Islands, whereas trade winds prevail below. Recent long-term analysis (1941–2013) of aerosol optical depth retrievals shows that there is an important multidecadal variability in summer dust export connected to the North African Dipol Intensity (NAFDI) and the North Atlantic ocean temperature long-term variability (
