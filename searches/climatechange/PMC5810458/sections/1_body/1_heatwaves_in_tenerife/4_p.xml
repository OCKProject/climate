<p id="par0050" class="p">Climate in the Canary Islands is mild, due to the influence of the NNE trade winds and the cool waters of the subtropical North Atlantic. These conditions prevent these Islands to suffer from the extreme weather conditions of the nearby Sahara desert, the largest and among the hottest deserts in the world. Episodically, cool trade wind weakens and easterly Saharan air reaches the Canaries. These Saharan air masses may prompt high temperatures, drops in relative humidity down to ∼15% (
