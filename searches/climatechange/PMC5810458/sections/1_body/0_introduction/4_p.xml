<p id="par0035" class="p">The work presented here refers to a case study for the Tenerife Island (Canary Islands) focused on heatwaves and strategies to cope with plausible yet uncertain developments. As heatwaves’ effects are sometimes connected to Saharan dust events and local air pollution episodes, these will also be considered. This paper describes an engagement activity carried out in Tenerife that sought to get insights from different actors about possible CC adaptation strategies and their implementation. The main objective of this work was to provide insights from different actors about the institutional and societal desirability and feasibility of adaptation strategies to CC in an island like Tenerife. We shall argue that establishing what and for whom is desirable and feasible requires the involvement of the “extended peer community" (

Four focus groups were carried out across the island with different social actors, including stakeholders and citizens. The ultimate aim of those group discussions was to develop visions of resilience and CC adaptation of Tenerife having heatwaves as the starting point. We first introduce the case study, followed by a review of cases on adaptation and resilience. The participatory methodology is then introduced followed by a discussion of the results, where we provide insights from the participatory process into strategies, practices, and institutional arrangements to address CC adaptation in small islands.
