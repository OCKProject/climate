In this paper the case of Tenerife (in the Canary Islands) is analysed. Tenerife is a small island located northwest of the African continent, in the Atlantic Ocean. Tenerife presents a high vulnerability to heatwaves and Saharan dust events as a consequence of its closeness to the Saharan desert. In fact, increasing frequency of heatwaves and Saharan dust events has been reported and could worsen in the future due to global warming. An exploration of adaptation strategies to an increase of the frequency and intensity of these phenomena is therefore needed. Different social actors have been engaged in a participatory process aiming at exploring pathways for adaptation to extreme weather events. Resilience was argued as the relevant framing to address those hazards. Four focus group sessions were carried out in order to explore key transformative elements necessary to make resilient futures for Tenerife. The results highlight the need for broader climate-based policies across all sectors to assure that the island becomes resilient to climatic and non-climatic shocks.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Citizen engagement</kwd><kwd>Stakeholder engagement</kwd><kwd>Focus group</kwd><kwd>Resilience</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0025">Small islands are already being affected by climate change (CC): morbidity and mortality are a consequence of extreme weather events, as well as vector- and food- and water-borne diseases (<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Nurse et al., 2014</xref>). Those extreme weather events refer to tropical cyclones, storm surges, flooding, and droughts leading to effects on human health, including drowning, injuries, disease transmission, and health effects derived from poor water quality (Nurse et al., <italic>Op.cit.</italic>).</p><p id="par0030">Heatwaves are also seen as an increasingly dangerous climatic hazard since both, warm days and nights have increased globally (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">EEA, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>).

As heatwaves&#x02019; effects are sometimes connected to Saharan dust events and local air pollution episodes, these will also be considered. This paper describes an engagement activity carried out in Tenerife that sought to get insights from different actors about possible CC adaptation strategies and their implementation. The main objective of this work was to provide insights from different actors about the institutional and societal desirability and feasibility of adaptation strategies to CC in an island like Tenerife. We shall argue that establishing what and for whom is desirable and feasible requires the involvement of the &#x0201c;extended peer community" (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993</xref>). Four focus groups were carried out across the island with different social actors, including stakeholders and citizens. The ultimate aim of those group discussions was to develop visions of resilience and CC adaptation of Tenerife having heatwaves as the starting point. We first introduce the case study, followed by a review of cases on adaptation and resilience. The participatory methodology is then introduced followed by a discussion of the results, where we provide insights from the participatory process into strategies, practices, and institutional arrangements to address CC adaptation in small islands.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Heatwaves in Tenerife</title><p id="par0040">Heatwaves are not only impacting on human health, but also on other species and ecosystems, as well as critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, transport and energy infrastructure, as a consequence of material overheating (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>). For instance, the heatwave of 2003 occurred in Western and central Europe produced damages to road and rail transport systems, interrupting energy supply, and increasing waterway transport prices as a consequence of low water levels associated to hydrological drought (IPCC, <italic>Op.cit.</italic>).</p><p id="par0045">The hottest summer in Europe in the last 500 years was observed in 2003, leading to high death rates that caused 70,000 deaths in 12 European countries (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">EEA, 2015</xref>). By 2050, heatwaves are expected to produce 120,000 additional deaths annually in the European Union, especially among elderly people (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">EEA, 2015</xref>). A recent study from <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Forzieri et al. (2017)</xref> mentioned heatwaves as the most lethal weather-related hazard in Europe leading to an increased mortality rate of 5400% by the end of the century in a &#x0201c;business as usual&#x0201d; scenario and no climate adaptation measures. Morbidity is also co-related to warm spells. In fact, it is known that skin eruptions, fatigue, cramps, syncope, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke might occur as a consequence of heat exposure (<xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2004</xref>). The importance of these phenomena for the Canary Islands is also quite prominent as we will see.</p><p id="par0050">Climate in the Canary Islands is mild, due to the influence of the NNE trade winds and the cool waters of the subtropical North Atlantic. These conditions prevent these Islands to suffer from the extreme weather conditions of the nearby Sahara desert, the largest and among the hottest deserts in the world. Episodically, cool trade wind weakens and easterly Saharan air reaches the Canaries. These Saharan air masses may prompt high temperatures, drops in relative humidity down to &#x0223c;15% (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 1991</xref>) and the presence of suspended desert dust. These heatwaves are mainly produced between spring and autumn (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 2007</xref>), usually reaching temperatures of 44&#x02013;45&#x000a0;&#x000b0; Celsius (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 1991</xref>); whereas night heat events reach maximums between 26 and 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0; Celsius (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="par0055">The most dangerous documented heatwaves took place in August 1990 and July 2004 (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 2007</xref>). According to <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Alonso P&#x000e9;rez (2007)</xref>, such episodes might have increased in intensity and frequency in the Canary Islands since 1970. In fact, the average number of heatwaves has quadrupled since 1994 and among the 10 strongest heatwaves recorded over the whole period, 5 have been detected during 2004&#x02013;2007 (<xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Sanz et al., 2007</xref>). Other authors also mention that a general rise of temperatures is expected for the Canary Islands in the future, intensified in upper parts of the islands (<xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n et al., 2012</xref>). The last heatwaves registered in the Canary Islands have left 13 premature deaths, more than any other meteorological hazard (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="par0060">Other climate hazards that might be related to the effects of heatwaves are dust events. There are two dust seasons in the Canary Islands, one in the winter and another in the summer. In the winter dust season (November &#x02013; March), Saharan dust events are associated with the easterly winds prompted by the occurrence of high pressure expanding from the North Atlantic over Western Europe and North Africa (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Alonso-P&#x000e9;rez et al., 2011</xref>). These events may induce extremely high concentrations at ground level (up to 2000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> have been recorded) and are not necessarily associated with high temperatures. Dust concentrations have duplicated since 1980.</p><p id="par0065">However, in the summer season (July and August) dust events are associated with the circulation of the dusty Saharan Air Layer (SAL) &#x02013; i.e. the hot and dry airstream that expands from North Africa to the Americas &#x02013; over the Canary Islands. The SAL results in hot, dry and dusty air between 500&#x000a0;m.a.s.l. and 5&#x000a0;km.a.s.l. above the Canary Islands, whereas trade winds prevail below. Recent long-term analysis (1941&#x02013;2013) of aerosol optical depth retrievals shows that there is an important multidecadal variability in summer dust export connected to the North African Dipol Intensity (NAFDI) and the North Atlantic ocean temperature long-term variability (<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2016</xref>). These islands have historically received Saharan dust as a consequence of large scale meteorological processes that involves mid-latitude waves, the NAFDI and the Saharan Heat Low (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Cuevas et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, when this event takes place, the Canaries become dusty and &#x000ab;naturally&#x000bb; polluted with particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>).</p><p id="par0070">Socio-economic impacts include reduced visibility which tends to affect both airports and their transport services, such as air traffic control and communication disturbance, including the closing of airports in extreme dust conditions (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Dorta, 2007</xref>). However, the impacts on human health are amongst the most relevant, since respiratory pathologies, anxiety disorders, and atypical thoracic pain usually affect local population (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>). Other studies have reported respiratory allergic diseases leading to increased use of air liquid as a respiratory therapy as much as 600% (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Belmonte et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been suggested that Saharan dust events might be related to the introduction of microbial communities, such as bacteria and viruses (<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="par0075">Furthermore, summer dust events are associated with meteorological conditions that have several environmental implications. Aircraft measurements and satellite observations (<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Tsamalis et al., 2013</xref>) have shown that the dusty, hot and dry SAL typically expands between 1 and 5&#x000a0;km.a.s.l. Atmospheric soundings have shown that during intense events, the SAL occurs above 500&#x000a0;m.a.s.l. over Tenerife, shifting the typical inversion layer associated with the trade winds to lower altitudes and resulting in high temperatures in the forest of the Island that typically occurs between 600 and 1800&#x000a0;m.a.s.l. These high temperatures represent an increased risk of forest fires, whereas the shifting to low altitudes of the inversion layer is typically associated with severe pollution episodes of industrial origin in the metropolitan area, due to the emissions of the oil refinery and shipping in the harbour of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">CSIC-AEMET-UHU, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="par0080">The most important sources of air pollutants in Tenerife are located along the Eastern coast of the Island (harbour and oil refinery in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Caletillas and Granadilla power plants). The prevailing NNE trade winds coupled with the inland sea breeze blowing during daylight prompts the inlands transport of these pollutants. In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the inland sea breeze blowing results in the inland transport of the SO<sub>2</sub> plumes from the refinery and from harbour, prompting fumigations of SO<sub>2</sub>, sulphuric acid and ultrafine particles to the population of the city from 10 to 17 GMT (<xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez and Rodr&#x000ed;guez, 2013</xref>). This situation worsens under summer SAL conditions due to the concentration of air pollutants at low altitudes linked to the downward shifts of the inversion layer and to heterogeneous reactions between pollutants and Saharan dust (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">CSIC-AEMET-UHU, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="par0085">Furthermore, the <italic>Hospital Universitario de Canarias</italic> and the Iza&#x000f1;a Atmospheric Research Centre found that hospital admissions due to heart failure are associated to exposure to ultrafine particles (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Dom&#x000ed;nguez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 2011</xref>), whereas black carbon has been associated with Acute Coronary Syndrome (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Dom&#x000ed;nguez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have also observed relationships between NO<sub>2</sub> and the ejection capacity of the heart (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Dominguez-Rodriguez et al., 2013a</xref>) and between SO<sub>2</sub> and obstructive lesions and Acute Coronary Syndrome (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Dom&#x000ed;nguez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p id="par0090">A CC Agency was created in April 2009 by means of a regional law (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">BOC, 2009</xref>). The aim of the Agency was the promotion, encouragement, orientation and coordination of policies, initiatives and measures to reach sustainable development as well as the mitigation of and adaptation to CC. The 25th of June 2012 the Government of the Canary Islands launched a regional law intended to adopt measures to reduce public administrations expenditure in order to respond to the financial crisis. The preface of the law indicated that budget cuts were required so as to &#x000ab;guarantee public expenditure sustainability&#x000bb; within an economic crisis that obliged the public administration to accomplish the objectives of budgetary stability (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">BOC, 2012</xref>). As a consequence of this law, the CC Agency was shut down.</p><p id="par0095">During those three years the Agency was able to develop a CC mitigation plan for the Canary Islands (<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Gafo-Fern&#x000e1;ndez, 2009</xref>), which is currently approved, as well as a CC adaptation plan, which has not been passed into law yet (<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Chamorro, 2010</xref>). However, both climate policies are currently considered to be out-dated by local climate experts (<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 2016</xref>), leaving the islands without a CC adaptation strategy in a context of high vulnerability to the effects of CC (<xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-D&#x000ed;ez et al., 2016</xref>).

These two ideas are illustrated in the next statement given in La Orotava: &#x000ab;<italic>I had two actions, two proposals for actions. One related to tourism; it&#x02019;s the carrying capacity of visitors. I raised this idea many years ago in a worldwide site that I almost got killed by the tourism sector. It was the possibility that the tourist who has to come to the Canary Islands pay a fee. I considered the Canary Islands so beautiful, so precious, especially related to the world of National Parks that the tourist who wants to come to the Canaries has to pay a tax for visiting the Islands.

These three hazards produce negative effects in local ecosystems and humans. Finding strategies to adapt to these events and their impacts is crucial in order to reduce morbi-mortality and environmental downside effects in Tenerife.</p><p id="par0300">This study brought insights into relevant institutional arrangements, social actors and desirable strategies to organise and deploy meaningful action against CC events in Tenerife. The participants of the focus groups discussed resilience as the main governance issue rather than focusing on the lack of adaptation strategies to heatwaves or other extreme weather events. In response to the researchers&#x02019; framing focused on the threats of those hazards, participants pointed out that making the island resilient to external shocks, be it climatic, economic or political was the issue that needed to be addressed.</p><p id="par0305">We adopt here the <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">IPCC (2014)</xref> definition of resilience, i.e. &#x000ab;the capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation&#x000bb; (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014, p. 1772</xref>).</p><p id="par0310">Hence, resilience appears to be the response that institutions and societal actors need to aim for when designing adaptation strategies to tame CC. Participants of this engagement exercise have proposed and critically examined desirable and feasible scenarios and actions within this new frame, developing meanings of resilience in the context of the island. In this new frame, the meanings of resilience for Tenerife were expressed in the following interlinked ways: 1) a sovereignty issue, 2) maladaptation avoidance, 3) environmental governance coherence, 4) sustainability of tourism, and 5) reduction of inequalities.</p><p id="par0315">Sovereignty meant energy use reduction, increasing independency of food production, good water resources management respectful of the insular biophysical limits, etc. In other words, participants sought to position their concerns and insights into a broader frame of governance of human societies and natural systems. This would imply a societal and governmental commitment towards increasing sovereignty levels. Maladaptation avoidance is clearly linked not only to sovereignty but also to coherent environmental governance. The nexus water-energy-food is relevant here as mitigation measures of CC can lead to increased stresses in energy resources: e.g. more energy for cooling, more desalination of water, etc. The tourism sector is by far the dimension with larger uncertainties. For example, can Tenerife be resilient depending on the tourism sector? Is there something like sustainable tourism? Could 6.4 million tourists&#x02019; fly to Tenerife in the post-oil era? Is anyone planning this scenario? These questions emerged during the debates, with no clear answers. Last but not least, inequality is an issue in Tenerife: population below relative poverty in Tenerife reaches almost 24% (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">ISTAC, 2017b</xref>). This has a relevant implication for the local context and requires deep transformations of societal organisation.</p><sec id="sec0085"><label>5.1</label><title>Final remarks</title><p id="par0320">The CC adaptation frame seems to be too narrow, especially in contexts characterised by insularity and other specificities. Indeed, the key issues that interested the dialogues about CC adaptation in a way or the other were all related to governance issues, including resources dependencies, unarticulated policies across sectors, disrespect for the island&#x02019;s carrying capacity, maladaptation strategies to CC, and inequality. They are all seen as hindering factors to enact useful strategies and action to protect humans and nature in Tenerife. In addition, the lack of symbolic institutions that lead action is considered another caveat towards serious action. The framing of resilience developed during the participatory process seems to be the desirable strategy to enact necessary transformation about those hindering factors.</p><p id="par0325">Global phenomena do not manifest equally around the planet, so any attempt to deal with CC issues needs to be situated. Involving relevant actors, including citizens means mobilisation of relevant types of knowledge to address in a hopefully lesser contended way the challenges that a changing climate of natural, social, economical and political nature bring today. The futuring angle of the methodology applied in this study was an interesting trigger to wonder about framings, uncertainties, expectations and imaginaries about strategy and action. Finally, we argue that dialogues about CC challenges are not only desirable but actually should be the pillar of any strategic development to address locally what is heralded as a global phenomena, not least because it is unimaginable that any thoughtful, feasible or desirable action can be taken without situated knowledge inputs in &#x0201c;insular&#x0201d; territories.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alonso P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Caracterizaci&#x000f3;n de las intrusiones de polvo africano en Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife: Departamento de F&#x000ed;sica B&#x000e1;sica</chapter-title><year>2007</year><publisher-name>Universidad de La Laguna</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alonso-P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuevas</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Querol</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Objective identification of synoptic meteorological patterns favouring African dust intrusions into the marine boundary layer of the subtropical eastern north Atlantic region</article-title><source>Meteorol.
