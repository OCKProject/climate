   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Schematic depiction of the synoptic-scale weather situation over Europe on 10 October 2011 at 00 UTC. A warm front (WF) is located over the Alps; behind the WF, an atmospheric river (AR) reaches the western Alps from the northwest, providing a supply of moisture to the Alps. The cold front (CF1) over Greece had crossed the Alps 2 days earlier, providing heavy snowfall. The L symbols indicate the locations of the low-pressure centres associated with the two fronts. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Schematic cross-section (northwest to southeast) across the Lötschen Valley, Switzerland, illustrating the strong contrast in precipitation between the two sides of the valley; the precipitation values [mm/12 h] indicate the accumulation at several locations between 00 UTC and 12 UTC on 10 October 2011. The solid blue arrow indicates the atmospheric river (AR) and the dashed line the cavity circulation, resulting in a feeder cloud.
