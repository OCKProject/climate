<p id="Par18" class="p">Few societal decisions are driven solely by, or are framed only by, concerns about climate change, but rather by sustainable development more generally. Storyline approaches acknowledge this context by communicating the potential consequences of climate change in ways that are relevant to the specific decision and the specific decision-maker (Hazeleger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2015</xref>). They are also naturally suited to non-probabilistic decision-making frameworks, which seek adaptation options that are robust within a context of deep uncertainty (Kalra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>; Simpson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2016</xref>). Storylines allow a way to explore such uncertainties in a traceable and physically plausible manner (see also the discussion in Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref> concerning sea-level risk in the Netherlands). It is important to undertake such analysis using an iterative process in which decision-maker concerns and interests shape the scientific research and modelling in a process of co-production (Kalra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>; Bhave et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2018</xref>).
