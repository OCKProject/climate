<p id="Par21" class="p">Another emerging application of the storyline approach, although very much in its infancy, is in the insurance sector. The insurance and reinsurance industries are slowly beginning to acknowledge the impacts of climate change on worldwide insured losses (Lloyd’s of London 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2014</xref>). Having a robust understanding of possible catastrophe losses, particularly of the extreme catastrophes, is essential for any insurance/reinsurance company’s internal capital management, definition of own risk appetite and solvency (EIOPA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>). The main tools for assessing such risk from natural perils are catastrophe models. By nature, catastrophe models are built to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">probabilistic risk</italic>, through the extrapolation of the limited observed record, in order to estimate a range of 
 <italic class="italic">potential</italic> catastrophes, their associated probabilities and corresponding losses (Grossi and Kunreuther 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, the same models can be and frequently are used to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">deterministic risk</italic> from various storm scenarios. As such, models are run to compute possible losses from a relevant historical event or a modified version of the historical event, for a given portfolio (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2017</xref>). This storyline approach of assessing risk for insured properties is an extremely useful method of stress-testing the client’s exposure to various weather and climate conditions.
