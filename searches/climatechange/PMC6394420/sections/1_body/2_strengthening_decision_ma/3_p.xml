<p id="Par20" class="p">Storylines are especially effective for considering risks from compound extreme events, namely those where severe impacts are triggered by the interaction of more than one variable. Examples include drought with heat waves (Ciais et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2005</xref>), windstorms with heavy precipitation (Martius et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2016</xref>), and fluvial flooding with storm surges (Kew et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2013</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> provides another example. Neither variable itself needs to be very extreme but the combination results in severe impacts (Leonard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2014</xref>). To study compound extremes statistically, long time series and refined statistical methods such as copulas are needed to capture and quantify the inter-dependence of the variables. A storyline approach is a very attractive complementary method to address compound extremes as it allows one to define very complex events starting from the impacts in a very flexible way, including spatial and temporal dependence (clustering) of extremes, which can generate the impacts (e.g. Muchan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2015</xref>). Storylines based on impacts can then be assigned a categorical plausibility using statements like ‘worldwide at least one similar event occurred before’. The Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection uses such an approach to prepare for a broad range of perils, including atmospheric hazards, but also technical and social threats (BABS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>). For each peril, they define three storylines with increasing severity and impacts.
