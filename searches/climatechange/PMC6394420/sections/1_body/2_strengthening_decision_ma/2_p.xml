<p id="Par19" class="p">An example of such an iterative process is provided by an analysis of the physical and legal dimensions of water diversions from the Upper Colorado River Basin under storylines of climate change (Yates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this case, three regional climate change simulations were used to stress test a model of the water supply system with and without an adaptation option. Stakeholders were engaged from the outset in the development of plausible storylines that captured both the direct and indirect consequences of climate change on the headwater areas. Here, ‘plausible’ meant internally consistent storylines of regional climate selected from within (rather than at, or beyond) the bounds of available climate model ensembles, 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> co-dependent exogenous factors that potentially affect water supply security over the planning horizons. For instance, when the ‘hotter and drier’ storyline was imagined, then water model parameters reflected possible hydrological changes associated with dust on snowpack, beetle infestation, or wildfires destroying forested areas. Stakeholders also specified metrics of water system behaviour and state relevant to their risk management context. In this way, both water managers and researchers arrived at a shared understanding of the system vulnerabilities and the extent to which the specified climate risks could be managed using a legal adaptation instrument.
