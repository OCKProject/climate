<p id="Par12" class="p">The availability bias is apparent in the history of physical infrastructure measures to mitigate natural disaster risk, which shows that such measures are often taken in direct response to disasters that have just occurred. This was the case with the North Sea flood of 1953, which led the Netherlands to develop the Delta Works and the UK the Thames barrier. A more recent example is Hurricane Sandy in New York City (Sobel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2014</xref>). Reports commissioned by state and local government had shown as early as 1995 that the city’s transportation systems were highly vulnerable to storm surge flooding from a potential hurricane, outlining in detail the specific facilities most at risk (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">1995</xref>). Subsequent studies refined the analysis, showing, in particular, the vulnerability of the subway system (Jacob et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2001</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2011</xref>). These studies had characteristics of a storyline, simulating flooding from specific hypothetical storms—and in the case of the later studies, adding sea level rise in varying amounts according to specific future scenarios. Recommendations made by these studies for investments to storm-proof infrastructure were not followed; to cite one egregious example, a new subway station at South Ferry, the southern tip of Manhattan, was opened in 2009 at a cost of approximately $550M. No substantive flood control measures were incorporated into the station’s design, despite the fact that the station’s location—and especially, its elevation—was essentially the same as that of the old station just adjacent, and that the 1995 report had highlighted that station as being at high risk for flooding. The station did in fact flood during Sandy, and returned to operation only in 2017, 5 years after the storm, at an expense comparable to the initial construction. As in the case of the 1953 North Sea flood, much more substantive investment in flood control has been made since the storm.
