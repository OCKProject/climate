<p id="Par16" class="p">There is also the issue of how to communicate the storyline. Well-designed board and card games can offer an immersive experience and tell stories and have been used to aid development decisions (Tint et al.

One way to engage infrastructure owners and managers with potential future climate change could be to produce a deck of cards with each card containing a simple textual description of a weather or climate event. The deck of events is a storyline of a potential future climate; different decks could be constructed to represent different storylines, e.g. with different frequencies of damaging extreme events. The participants then discuss the potential impact of each event on their infrastructure, how the impact of that event on other infrastructure might affect them and how they might mitigate the damage from the event. This allows decision-makers to understand how potentially cascading events might affect their infrastructure, including the cumulative impact of multiple events. The participants would work through the card deck discussing each event, observed and supported by a facilitator. Importantly, the participants, like in reality, would not know what events are still to come. At the end of the deck, the facilitator would then discuss with the participants which events, or combination of events, mattered to them and for which ones damage mitigation would require substantial investment. It is for those events that subsequent risk assessment could be made.
