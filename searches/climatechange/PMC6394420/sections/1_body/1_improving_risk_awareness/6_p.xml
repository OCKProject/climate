<p id="Par15" class="p">This is the approach advocated by Hazeleger et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2015</xref>), who construct storylines (called tales) of future weather that illustrate the implications of climate change for real-life high-impact weather events. This is done by mapping historical or hypothetical events onto future climate conditions. Examples of the approach include rerunning weather episodes in a limited-area weather-prediction model with elevated temperatures as boundary conditions (Attema et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2014</xref>; Prein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2016</xref>), diagnosing unprecedented storms in future climate integrations (Haarsma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2013</xref>) and exploring multivariate drivers of local extreme water levels (Van den Hurk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2015</xref>). That such ‘simulated experience’ is more effective at conveying risk than statistical characterizations has been recognised more widely in the decision-making literature (Hogarth and Soyer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>), building on insights from experimental psychology (Gigerenzer and Hoffrage 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1995</xref>).
