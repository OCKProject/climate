<p id="Par22" class="p">Many studies have shown that the atmospheric response to climate change can be usefully understood as a combination of what might be called a thermodynamic component (surface warming, moistening, melting of ice) and a dynamic component (changes in atmospheric circulation) (e.g. Deser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2014</xref>). The distinction is not precise because both components of the climate system are coupled; in practice, either the dynamic component is defined as the component congruent with internal variability (Deser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2004</xref>) with the thermodynamic component obtained as a residual or (especially for precipitation) the thermodynamic component is defined as the component obtained in the absence of changes in circulation, with the dynamic component obtained as a residual (Pfahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>).
