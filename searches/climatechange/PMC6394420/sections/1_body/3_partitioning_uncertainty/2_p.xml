<p id="Par23" class="p">The reason the distinction is useful is, first, that there is a striking contrast between the degree of confidence we have in the two components (Shepherd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2014</xref>; Trenberth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2015</xref>). Thermodynamic aspects of climate change are generally robust in theory, observations and models (although there is substantial quantitative uncertainty associated with climate sensitivity). In contrast, dynamic aspects are not anchored in accepted theories, have not yet emerged in observations and diverge between models (Shepherd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2014</xref>). Second, model uncertainties in climate sensitivity and in dynamic aspects of climate change (after scaling by global mean warming) appear to be uncorrelated (e.g. Zappa and Shepherd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2017</xref>), which makes sense as they are associated with different aspects of model error. The distinction between thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of climate change provides an alternative to the usual approach of considering ensembles of model simulations, which mix together uncertainties in the two aspects, and may help to provide information on where the largest uncertainties lie (e.g. Pfahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). In particular, storylines can be considered for each aspect.
