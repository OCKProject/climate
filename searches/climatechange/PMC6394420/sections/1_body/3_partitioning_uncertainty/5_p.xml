<p id="Par26" class="p">On a continental scale, it is possible to make statements about future climate (such as extreme precipitation in the mid-latitudes will increase) with a high degree of confidence since the spatially aggregated signal is driven primarily by the thermodynamic response to radiative forcing and global temperature increase (Fischer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, at a regional scale, mid-latitude precipitation extremes are strongly influenced by the dynamic response, and they could either increase or decrease depending on the changes in circulation (Fischer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pfahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). Manzini et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2014</xref>) showed that much of the model spread in wintertime circulation changes over the northern extratropics is related to the model spread in remote drivers such as tropical warming, Arctic warming and stratospheric vortex change. Zappa and Shepherd (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2017</xref>) used this framework to develop storylines of European circulation change, conditioned on a given level of global warming. That the influence of the remote drivers is causal is supported by evidence from seasonal prediction and from single-forcing model experiments. It was found that for central European wintertime storminess and wintertime Mediterranean drying, two important climate change impacts for Europe, the difference between the most extreme storylines was equivalent to that from several degrees of global mean temperature increase.
