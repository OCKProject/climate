<p id="Par4" class="p">Alternative approaches are thus emerging that do not seek to quantify probabilities, but instead to develop descriptive ‘storylines’, ‘narratives’ or ‘tales’ of plausible future climates. We broadly refer to these as ‘storyline’ approaches. Whilst there has been variation in the use of these terms, there are some common characteristics: in particular, the emphasis on qualitative understanding rather than quantitative precision, and the acceptance that storylines are not probabilistic. Here, we define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. (A trend can be considered a long-lasting event.) As no a priori probability of the storyline is assessed, it is not a prediction. Emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved and the plausibility of those factors (or of changes in those factors). Typically, more than one storyline is considered, to explore multiple plausible futures. However, we also include past events, because historical events are not simply single data points but involve detailed stories which can be unpacked (March et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2018</xref>) have argued that the fact that the past is now fixed should not blind us to the usefulness of past sequences of events as available realisations of the time evolution of systems, asserting that scenarios derived this way can be ‘counterfactual histories of the future’. Inspired by the viewpoint of statistical physics they advocate that ‘to fill gaps in knowledge of rare extreme events without waiting an inordinately long time for further occurrence, historical disasters can be used much more extensively as a currently available test laboratory for scenario discovery’.
