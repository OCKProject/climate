<p id="Par7" class="p">There are many references to storylines, narratives, and scenarios in climate change literature, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The term ‘narrative’ is often used by social scientists to characterise peoples’ views, understandings or perspectives. Narrative analysis is used to investigate climate change discourses and the framing of climate change by the media, policy-makers or other stakeholders. Whilst these are all important aspects of climate change research (Fløttum and Gjerstad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>), our focus here is on the rather different task of constructing storylines to represent uncertainty. The term ‘scenario’ is often used in decision-making to represent an imagined future, with reference to the scenario technique of Herman Kahn and colleagues (Kahn and Wiener 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1967</xref>). The emphasis on self-consistency and plausibility, and the fact it is not a prediction, has much in common with storylines, as does the benefit for risk awareness (Lempert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2013</xref>). Indeed, the term storyline is often used in this context, as the part of a scenario where the future is described by words and not numbers (Alcamo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2008</xref>). Within climate change science, the term scenario is generally associated with shared socio-economic pathways and their associated climate forcings, where the uncertainty lies in the domain of human choices, and concerns the future. Our focus here is instead on uncertainty in the
