 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows how all four reasons are manifest in the consideration of the Swiss rain-on-snow event discussed above; more examples, with additional detail, are provided within each section. The flooding and mudflows (panel c) improve risk awareness (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>) by providing a salient event, moreover one that was not forecasted. Strengthened decision-making (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>) is evident in the development of adaptation measures (panel d). The synoptic-scale weather setting (panel a) provides a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty to assess future risk, including the distinction between thermodynamic (warmth and moisture) and dynamic (wind) factors (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref>). Finally, the strong enhancement of the precipitation on the southeastward-facing slopes of the valley was due to a very local cavity circulation and associated ‘seeder-feeder’ effect (panel b), a meteorological phenomenon not captured by the weather forecast models—which is why the event was not forecasted—and which thereby explores the boundaries of plausibility relative to what is currently represented in the models (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref>).
