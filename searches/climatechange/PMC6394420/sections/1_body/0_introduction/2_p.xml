<p id="Par3" class="p">As the scientific and policy discussion shifts from whether anthropogenic climate change is real to the evaluation of potential regional impacts and response options, the limitations of these probabilistic approaches to the physical aspects of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent (Kennel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>). Climate models have structural errors, many of which are shared, which challenges a probabilistic interpretation of multi-model ensembles (Knutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2013</xref>). In contrast to weather forecasting, the shortness of the observational record from a climate change perspective makes it very difficult to

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2010</xref>). As regional climate phenomena such as storm tracks respond differently to climate change in different models (Shepherd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2014</xref>), a multi-model mean can lead to a washed-out response that does not correspond to any model simulation. Effective bias correction of multivariate relationships, such as those involved in compound events, requires vast amounts of data that may not exist. In any case, it is not known how to correct model biases in simulating climate

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>). Estimates of uncertainties at the regional scale can quickly accumulate to a point where this knowledge hinders rather than supports scenario-led climate adaptation decision-making (Wilby and Dessai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2010</xref>).
