<p id="Par5" class="p">An example of such a storyline is provided by the rain-on-snow event in the Swiss Alps that occurred on 10 October 2011, which led to severe flooding and mudflows (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). On 8 October 2011, a cold front reached Switzerland, and in the following 2 days, sustained northerly winds resulted in substantial snow accumulations in the Alps. This was followed by the passage of a warm front on 10 October 2011, combined with an atmospheric river—an elongated and narrow area of very high atmospheric moisture transport—flowing directly into Switzerland. The warming together with the large moisture transport against the Alps resulted in snowmelt together with large amounts of rainfall in the western Swiss Alps (Rössler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2014</xref>; Piaget et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2015</xref>). The combined water from the snowmelt and the rainfall led to flooding and the formation of mudflows in the Kander and Lötschen valleys. The effects were extremely local, as the southeastward-facing slopes received more than three times the precipitation amounts that fell on the northwestward-facing slopes, because of orographic effects (Rössler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2014</xref>). The mudflows on the southeastward-facing slopes and the floods had significant impacts on the local transportation infrastructure, blocking roads and a tunnel. A mudflow dyke was subsequently built to protect the tunnel damaged in the event from future similar events, and the river morphology was modified to reduce flood-related risk.
