<p id="Par35" class="p">The term ‘post-normal science’ was introduced by Funtowicz and Ravetz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">1993</xref>) to describe a situation where either the decision stakes or the systems uncertainties are high, and hence the use of evidence is contested. They noted that many environmental issues fall into this category, including climate change. In such a situation, traditional methods of scientific problem-solving (reductionist, expert-based) are ineffective. The failure to recognise these limitations helps explain why there has been a persistent gap between the production and use of climate information (Kirchhoff et al.
