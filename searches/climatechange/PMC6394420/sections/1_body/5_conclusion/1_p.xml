<p id="Par33" class="p">We have presented a typology of four reasons for taking a storyline approach in climate change research and communication. Storylines can raise risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner—where events can be long-lasting, such as a trend—which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk. Storylines can provide an effective mechanism for strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests. Storylines can provide a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner. Finally, storylines can explore the boundaries of plausibility, beyond what might be provided by a standard set of modelling tools, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise (Parker and Risbey
