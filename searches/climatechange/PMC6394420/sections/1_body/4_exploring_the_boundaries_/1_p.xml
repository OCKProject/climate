<p id="Par28" class="p">If climate projections could be reliably articulated as probability predictions (conditioned on scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions), then the societal consequences could be presented as quantified risks or as changing risk profiles. The conventional approach to climate projection is focused on making such (conditional) probability predictions by applying complex post-processing methodologies (including bias correction and downscaling) to the output of GCMs. If the climate system was well understood and could be simulated accurately at all relevant scales, then this engineering approach to climate projections would be appropriate. However, such a proposition has been challenged (Smith

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2013</xref>). Furthermore, twenty-first century projections with GCMs have only partial exploration of model uncertainty (Knutti et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2016</xref>). Confidence in the processes simulated by climate models rests instead on the robustness of the model behaviour when compared with a variety of types of observations, within a causal framework (Lloyd
