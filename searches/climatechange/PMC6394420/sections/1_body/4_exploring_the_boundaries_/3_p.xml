<p id="Par30" class="p">The fact that climate models do not fully simulate the range of response uncertainty is particularly evident for local-scale extreme events. For example, it has been found that short-duration (hourly) summertime precipitation extremes are well simulated only in very-high-resolution (&lt; 4 km) regional climate models (RCMs) that explicitly represent deep convection, and not in conventional RCMs that parameterise deep convection, and that intensity increases with warming are much larger in the high-resolution simulations (Kendon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2017</xref>). This suggests that conventional national climate change scenarios may underestimate the potential changes to short-duration precipitation extremes. However, very-high-resolution regional simulations can be used together with observations and theoretical understanding to provide risk estimates within a storyline framework. Meredith et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref>) argued that a convective event leading to intense flooding could be attributed to Black Sea warming using an RCM with explicit convection constrained by large-scale reanalysis, but that the response simulated with parameterised convection was physically implausible. Prein et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2016</xref>) used a similar approach to make statements about future risk of extreme precipitation and flooding for the USA. Such targeted very-high-resolution simulations of relevant phenomena combine process understanding with the sampling of otherwise unexplored uncertainties and thereby greatly contribute to the establishment of robust projections of localised extreme events.
