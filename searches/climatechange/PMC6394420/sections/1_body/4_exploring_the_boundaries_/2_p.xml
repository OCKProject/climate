<p id="Par29" class="p">Storyline approaches can do this by placing the emphasis on physical plausibility when making statements about future climate. They do so by using models as tools to support and test theories regarding the interactions of climate processes, rather than as a source of quantitative climate predictions. Scientific understanding is used to push out the boundaries of plausible futures by proposing mechanisms through which outcomes not currently seen in GCMs, either because of missing physics or because of insufficient sampling, could arise (Hazeleger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2015</xref>; Zscheischler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2018</xref>). This provides a more thorough exploration of the range of uncertainty reflected by todayâ€™s level of scientific understanding, compared to the limited range represented by the extant ensembles of GCM projections.
