 <result pre="participants' opinion, only about 7% of the respondents reckoned that" exact="climate" post="change is a serious problem. The majority of participants"/>

 <result pre="several knowledge weaknesses among participants. First, participants did not consider" exact="climate" post="change as a serious problem or they had low"/>
 <result pre="climate change as a serious problem or they had low" exact="climate" post="change awareness. The poor understanding perhaps correlated with their"/>
 <result pre="awareness. The poor understanding perhaps correlated with their opinion that" exact="climate" post="change evidence is not convincing. This result was different"/>

 <result pre="Thus, it can be seen from the participants' opinion that" exact="climate" post="change only affects infectious diseases and does not impact"/>
 <result pre="diseases. Considering this research finding, it is necessary to include" exact="climate" post="change science in the school curricula as mentioned in"/>
 <result pre="study in Austria and Denmark, which is critical in improving" exact="climate" post="change science education [ 27], including through the school"/>
 <result pre="including through the school system. Participants revealed that their primary" exact="climate" post="change information source is from family. We were surprised"/>
 <result pre="60% of the respondents stated that the television is their" exact="climate" post="change information source [ 29]. Meanwhile, using smartphones or"/>
 <result pre="could be a promising tool for spreading information, including on" exact="climate" post="change impact on health. This finding was in line"/>
 <result pre="as an additional tool [ 32]. Generally, participants' understanding of" exact="climate" post="change and its impact on human health is relatively"/>
 <result pre="health is relatively not consistent. For example, they said that" exact="climate" post="change is caused by a natural process, but on"/>
 <result pre="that the industrial sector is one of the causes of" exact="climate" post="change. In another example, respondents said that climate change"/>
 <result pre="causes of climate change. In another example, respondents said that" exact="climate" post="change impacted human health, but they did not give"/>

 <result pre="setting to have a large impact on the community. Building" exact="climate" post="change awareness in adolescents also can be done using"/>
 <result pre="media, such as television, radio, and social media, to provide" exact="climate" post="change evidence through impressive animations. Likewise, we propose that"/>
 <result pre="it determines the social adaptive capacity. Providing proper information regarding" exact="climate" post="change and health for young people is a valuable"/>
 <result pre="of the city's development. Overall, we are already experiencing a" exact="climate" post="change; if we do not take a massive action,"/>
