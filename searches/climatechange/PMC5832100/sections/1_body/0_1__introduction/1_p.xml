<p class="p">Climate change, which is a process of changing the climate system over a long period and over a wide area due to natural processes or as a consequence of human activity [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], has become a global issue. Natural processes have a small contribution to climate change, whereas human activity is the most significant contributor. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that evidence of human influence on climate system change is well defined [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Climate change is related to global economic developments that influence industrialization improvement, including greenhouse gases emission [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Greenhouse gases consist of several gases; one of them is carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), which is mainly produced by fuels burning activities. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration has increased by 31% since 1750 [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], which was mainly caused by deforestation, transportation activities, and the industrial sector. Scientists noticed the changing of climate systems via some signs [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]: the global average temperature has increased by 0.6°C since 1861 and then by 0.6 ± 0.2°C throughout the 20th century. Likewise, the global sea level rose by 0.1 to 0.2 meters during the 20th century. Lastly, the snow cover and ice extent decreased by about 10%.
