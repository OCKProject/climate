<p class="p">As a big archipelagic state, Indonesia is one of the countries that are vulnerable to climate changes because of its geographical position and subtropical climate [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]; it also has a large population density, who rely on agriculture [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Sea level rise, flooding, drought, and landslides are different forms of climate change hazards that harm Indonesia. Climate change in Indonesia has been noticed from the temperature increase of about 0.3Â°C since 1990, and it happened in all seasons all the year [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. During precipitation, it was predicted that Indonesia will experience around 2-3% more precipitation each year due to climate change (Ratag, 2001 [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]). In the last three decades, Indonesia has experienced several disasters, 80% of which were associated with climate change [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This has shown that Indonesia is a very vulnerable country to climate change.
