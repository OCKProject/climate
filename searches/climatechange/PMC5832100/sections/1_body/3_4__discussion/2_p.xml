<p class="p">In this study, we measured the climate change knowledge among adolescents who were in senior high school. Through a structured questionnaire, we found several knowledge weaknesses among participants. First, participants did not consider climate change as a serious problem or they had low climate change awareness. The poor understanding perhaps correlated with their opinion that climate change evidence is not convincing. This result was different from a research in the Czech Republic which identified that more than 80% of research participants (adolescents) had good climate change awareness [

Thus, it can be seen from their opinion that climate change was an unbreakable process; also, they articulated that climate change is caused by a natural process. On the other hand, it is clear that humans profoundly contributed to the increases in greenhouse gases, which triggered global warming and climate change [
