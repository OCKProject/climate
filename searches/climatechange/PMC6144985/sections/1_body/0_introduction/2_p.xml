<p class="p">Ecosystems are changing rapidly in response to increasing temperature, altered precipitation patterns, and increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations ([CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]), all of which are influencing the abundance and distribution of many plant and animal species across the globe (Lindner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Positive carbon fertilization effects have been shown in experiments (Bader et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), but it is unclear whether increased carbon availability could affect the growth of natural populations. Additionally, climate change drivers may show complex long‐term interactions that can modify their effect on plant performance and species interactions (e.g. Lindner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the main tool to model species response to climate change at large scales, spatial distribution models (SDMs), seldom account for increased [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>], or variable interactions, likely because this is methodologically challenging (Norby &amp; Luo, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). As a consequence, it is unclear whether carbon fertilization might interact with other climate change drivers to influence the outcome of climate models.
