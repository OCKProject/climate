<p class="p">The response of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> to changing environment will likely depend on the action of several climate change drivers, which can also be affected by the interactions between them. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix,</italic> we expect both temperature and precipitation to be critical factors to define the species distribution. We also expect 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> to profit from increased carbon availability. However, given the high drought stress that Mediterranean plants experience in summer, we also expect summer water availability to influence whether the plant can profit from the increased carbon availability. Specifically, we aim here to explore the following questions: (a) How might 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> respond to future climate change? To address this point, we used presence records to model the species climatic niche using SDMs, to obtain predictions of suitable habitat under current and future climatic conditions. (b) Does 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> benefit from increasing atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations ([CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>])? To explore this, we used data from a study site in Italy to look at the long‐term interactive effects of [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and temperature on the performance of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>, and its host tree, 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus cerris</italic> using tree rings and assessing cavitation risk. (c) Could carbon fertilization effects substantially modify the climate‐only model habitat predictions? As higher carbon availability cannot currently be accounted for in the SDM, we explored the potential effects by creating two future carbon fertilization scenarios for 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> and comparing them with the previously developed, climate‐only model.
