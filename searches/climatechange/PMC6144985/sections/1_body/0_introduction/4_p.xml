<p class="p">The most important and widespread of the liana woody species in Europe is English ivy, 
 <italic class="italic">Hedera helix</italic>. There have been a handful of works studying 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>'s growth, effects on host performance, and host preference (Nola

 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>); however, it yet remains unknown how 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> might respond to the new environmental conditions brought by recent and future changes in climate. Three main mechanisms have been suggested for the observed expansion of liana species in recent years: higher resource availability (which includes both increased atmospheric carbon concentration and increased nutrient deposition), changes in temperature and precipitation, and increased levels of disturbance (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; further discussed in Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Most of these effects, however, are still poorly explored, and only the positive correlation of liana density with disturbance is well documented in both tropical (e.g. Ledo &amp; Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and temperate environments (e.g. Allen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Some studies have explored the effects of carbon fertilization on liana growth (Hättenschwiler &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Marvin, Winter, Burnham, &amp; Schnitzer,

 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Zotz, Cueni, &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), but these results remain highly controversial as carbon fertilization experiments have shown results ranging from no response (Marvin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) to over 60%–100% biomass stimulation (Hättenschwiler &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Zotz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The effect of changing temperature is also uncertain, although it has been presumed that an increase in temperatures will likely facilitate lianas to survive winter conditions (Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). There are no comparative assessments of the importance of each mechanism and their interactions, which would be necessary to accurately forecast how these species will respond to future climatic change.
