<p class="p">We used Maxent software (Phillips &amp; Dudík, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) to calculate the SDMs. Maxent is a presence‐only modeling software that calculates habitat distributions with a maximum entropy algorithm. We selected the three most relevant climatic variables, based on a preliminary Jack‐knife and variable importance analyses, ecological knowledge of the species, and after excluding highly correlated variables (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.7 or VIF &gt;3), to reduce overfitting or collinearity problems. For each model, we randomly split the dataset into 75% (training) and 25% (test) subdatasets (Fielding &amp; Bell, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). The final model estimates are averages after 10 repetitions with randomly split subdatasets. To check the effect of variable selection on model performance, we calculated differences in the area under the curve metric (AUC) between the saturated (with all 19 climatic variables) and the minimal model (three variables) for each species. We used 70% of maximum Maxent suitability as a threshold to define habitat suitability.
