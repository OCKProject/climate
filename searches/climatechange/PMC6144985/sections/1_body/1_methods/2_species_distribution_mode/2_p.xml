<p class="p">We constructed SDMs from publicly available occurrence data for one of the main liana species in European forests, 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>. We used occurrence data from the global biodiversity information facility (GBIF,

In our search, we used the species name and limited the results to “observation” data after 1900, to avoid including herbarium specimens, specimens preserved in botanical gardens, or machine observations. Repeated presence points (i.e. those with exactly same coordinates) were eliminated to avoid overfitting problems. Climate information was obtained from the Bioclim dataset (

Forecasted climatic values for 2050 and 2070 were obtained from downscaled predictions by the atmospheric model Hadley Global Environment Model (HadGEM2‐AO) (Martin et al.,
