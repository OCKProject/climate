<p class="p">We used long‐term climate records from the Climate Research Unit (CRU), University of East Anglia (available at:

Each individual tree ring series was transformed to basal area increment (BAI) before analyzing. BAI provides a better quantification of biomass production in ever‐increasing individuals (Schweingruber,

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. Tree identity and series temporal autocorrelation were included as random terms in the model. We included all two‐way interactions between the variables, and BAI was square rooted to meet normality and heteroscedasticity assumptions. We did model selection by backward deletion, based on likelihood ratio tests and comparisons between models using ANOVA and Akaike's information criterion (AIC), to find the most plausible, minimal, model (Crawley, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). It is important to notice that in the case of lianas, BAI may underestimate the annual increase in biomass, as lianas are characterized by a stronger increase in length, rather than in diameter, meaning that our results may underestimate liana response to increased carbon availability.
