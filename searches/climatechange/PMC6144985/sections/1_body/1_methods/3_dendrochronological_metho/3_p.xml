<p class="p">In August 2014, we sampled two increment cores per individual from 30 randomly spaced trees and 32 lianas dispersed over the whole study area (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>a). We selected dominant trees to maximize the climatic signal (Schweingruber, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1966</xref>) and for similar reasons, avoided sampling the trees on which our sampled lianas were growing to prevent confounding effects of lianas on their hosts. We targeted

 <italic class="italic">Hedera helix</italic> individuals growing as a continuous grass‐like layer were not sampled to avoid pseudoreplication problems. Sampling, cross‐dating, and measurement followed standard dendrochronological methods (Bräker,

A small percentage of cores with growth anomalies or undetectable rings were discarded, but at least one core was maintained for all but one individual.
