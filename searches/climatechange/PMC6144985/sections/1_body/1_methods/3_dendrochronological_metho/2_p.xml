<p class="p">In our second analysis, we explored the long‐term growth trend of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> individuals and their response to increasing carbon availability and changing climate in an Italian case study. We sampled tree rings in 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Q. cerris</italic> in temperate submontane forests in Abruzzo region, central Italy (Supporting Information Figure

 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We targeted 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> rather than other liana species because it is known to form distinctive and regular tree rings that have been cross‐dated successfully in the literature, and it is long‐lived (in our study area, the oldest individual had 79 dated years). It is also important that in our study area, 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> allocates all its growth to one principal stem rather than dividing it between several small ones, thus providing a better proxy for the total biomass of the individual.
