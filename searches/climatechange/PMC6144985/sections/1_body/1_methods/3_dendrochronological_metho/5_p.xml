<p class="p">To visualize the interaction between [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and maximum temperature on secondary growth for both species, we calculated the change in slope in the growth‐[CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] correlation with regularly increasing maximum temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We also showed the overall influence of this interaction on the growth time series for each species by plotting predicted growth over time under‐recorded [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and constant [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. When assumed to be constant, [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] was assigned the average value of the complete available record. Tree age was also considered constant in the model predictions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
