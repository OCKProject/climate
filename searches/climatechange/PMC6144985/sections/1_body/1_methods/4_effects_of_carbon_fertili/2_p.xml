<p class="p">To illustrate how a positive effect of increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] could affect model predictions of future habitat suitability, we defined three potential CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐effect scenarios for future 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> habitat distributions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These were as follows: “no fertilization,” “slight carbon fertilization,” (simply assuming a 10% increase in habitat suitability across Europe following carbon fertilization), and “strong carbon fertilization” (a 20% increase in habitat suitability) scenarios. These numbers are necessarily arbitrary and used for explorative purposes only, as there is no available method to translate growth responses into changes in habitat suitability. They are also different to the previously described modeling approach that reconstructs growth with and without CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects. A 10%–20% increase in habitat suitability seems a realistic assumption given the strong response to [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] observed in our long time series, as well as the strong, unsaturated response of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> to carbon fertilization in previous experimental studies. Hättenschwiler and Körner (
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) recorded up to 100% increase in biomass and 137% in stem length under 660 ppm of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, without signs of carbon saturation, and Zotz et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) similarly observed a 30%–60% increase in length and biomass increment in shoots of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> under elevated CO2. All these analyses were carried out in the R software (R Core Team 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
