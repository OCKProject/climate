<p class="p">We found that climate‐only models predicted slight changes in the total area suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Hedera helix</italic> in the future, accompanied by large shifts in the species range toward the north and east of Europe. These models, however, could not account for the effects related to an increase in [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] or the interactions between climate change variables, which our long‐term case study suggests can have a significant effect on liana growth. Our models show that even small increases in habitat suitability, related to carbon fertilization, might substantially influence the future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>, allowing it to expand and persist in areas where it would not otherwise. Our results therefore highlight the need for new approaches to distribution modeling, not only to account for carbon fertilization as we showed here, but also to include its interactions with changing climate. Long‐term growth observations and experiments assessing the response of different species to changing climatic conditions are mostly lacking, and the combination of multiple approaches, such as tree ring analysis and classical modeling employed here, can complement traditional manipulative experiments and further improve the accuracy of ecological models.
