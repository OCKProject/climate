<p class="p">We illustrate how the positive effects of [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] on 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> might affect its future distribution, using three carbon fertilization scenarios. Even small carbon fertilization effects could drastically change the predictions of how 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> will cope with drier conditions in central and southern Europe, as well the extent to which it will expand northwards (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). It is noteworthy that, due to the nature of the interaction between the temperature and carbon fertilization effects, it is likely that our model underestimates suitability in the colder areas of Europe while overestimating it for the hotter southern European localities, as [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] effects were found to be lower at high temperature (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Whether the increase in growth that we observed over time in response to [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] would translate into changes in range size remains speculative. Our results stress the need for methodological development to mechanistically include the effects of [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and their interactions in SDMs. Our findings seem to indicate that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects and their interactions can have important consequences for ecological modeling and thus cannot be ignored when modeling future species distributions.
