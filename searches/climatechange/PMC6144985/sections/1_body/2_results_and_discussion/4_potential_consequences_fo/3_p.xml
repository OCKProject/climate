<p class="p">Liana species other than 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> may not respond similarly to increased [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. Deciduous species, in particular, may not profit as strongly as evergreen ones because they do not benefit from the increase in the growing season more than their host trees (Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). To test the effect of carbon fertilization on other liana species, [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] fertilization experiments coupled with dendrochronological studies, where possible, would be required. It is suggested that under high long‐term [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>], other resources (e.g. soil phosphorus) can become limiting to plant growth, and therefore, no long‐term fertilization effect would be expected (Bader et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We found no saturating effect in the carbon fertilization curve; however, as our approach is not manipulative, carbon fertilization effects are limited to those increases which have occurred in the last decades. The growth response that we observed is therefore in response to much lower [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] than those used in fertilization experiments but it is in line with reports from other fertilization experiments with temperate lianas that did not find a reduction in carbon fertilization effect after a 80% increase in [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. This is a much larger increase than what has been observed in the last decades (Hättenschwiler &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, saturating effects could appear in the future as [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] increases further. These potentially complex effects further underline the need to consider interactions between factors when predicting responses to climate change.
