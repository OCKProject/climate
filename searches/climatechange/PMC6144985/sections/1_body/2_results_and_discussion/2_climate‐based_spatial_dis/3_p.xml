<p class="p">Our model was robust to variable selection, as the reduction in AUC values between the saturated (19 climatic variables) and minimal (three climatic variables) models was lower than 0.1% (AUC: 0.771; AUC
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = 0.774). The AUC values were slightly smaller than the usual 0.8 threshold considered for model evaluation, which may be caused by high species plasticity or intraspecific variability. As in all SDMs, habitat suitability models do not necessarily represent the future realized distribution of the species. The actual responses of populations to environmental change are more complex and include factors such as dispersion, microenvironmental conditions, human disturbances, host preference, and other biotic environmental factors, which interact with habitat suitability to define the realized presence of the species (Fitzpatrick &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A particularly relevant factor to define the realized distribution in the case of lianas is host preference. However, it is unlikely that this factor plays an important role in the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>, as it seems to have low host specificity and preferences are driven more by size and bark characteristics (Castagneri et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or forest successional stage (Ladwig &amp; Meiners, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) than responses to particular tree species.
