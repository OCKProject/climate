<p class="p">The SDMs showed that changes in temperature and precipitation alone will likely alter the amount of habitat suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> in Europe, requiring large range shifts for the species to track its climatic niche (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> climatic niche was mainly defined by precipitation in the coldest quarter of the year (51% permutated variable importance), annual mean temperature (42.6% variable importance), and precipitation in the wettest quarter (6.4% variable importance). The positive correlation with mean temperature is in line with the biogeographical history of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>, which evolved from tropical families under warmer climates (Metcalfe, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Our models project a slight increase in 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> habitat by 2050 and a slight decrease by 2070 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), but there is a large shift in the species range toward the north and east in the future (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). A future increase in the mean temperature in eastern and northern parts of Europe might make these regions suitable for frost‐sensitive liana species in the near future (Gianoli, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Also, a positive correlation with winter precipitation supports the hypothesis that evergreen lianas may profit more from warmer conditions in winter and early spring than their broadleaved counterparts, as they can benefit from high light conditions before tree bud break occurs (Schnitzer, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In central and southern Europe, increasingly dry conditions are expected to translate into a decrease in the amount of suitable habitat, with 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> expected to be retained only in mountainous areas (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b,c). Changes in temperature and precipitation could therefore substantially alter southern European forests by causing the loss of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>.
