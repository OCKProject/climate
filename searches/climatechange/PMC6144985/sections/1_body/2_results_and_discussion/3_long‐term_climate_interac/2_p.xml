<p class="p">While our models predict that changes in temperature and precipitation are likely to impact 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> distribution, they do not account for the effects of increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. The tree ring analysis, on the other hand, showed this is an important factor, as we found a strong and significant correlation between increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and growth for both 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Q. cerris</italic>. This is consistent with experimental results (Körner, Morgan, &amp; Richard Norby, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Zotz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Importantly, however, the effects of carbon fertilization depended on temperature ([CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] × maximum temperature interaction) and the strength and shape of this interaction differed between the liana and the tree (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Q. cerris</italic> trees only grew better with increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] under cool conditions, while their growth was reduced by increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] under warm conditions. By contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> benefited from increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] under most recorded climatic conditions, although the positive effect of carbon fertilization decreased in warmer conditions. The model predictions assuming constant or observed [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] revealed that the increase in 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> growth since the 1950s could not be explained by temperature alone, but was correlated with increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>a,b). 
 <italic class="italic">Q. cerris</italic> growth, on the other hand, has not increased over time. The trends in vulnerability to cavitation support these findings: Increasing cavitation risk with increasing temperature suggests that the inability of 
 <italic class="italic">Q. cerris</italic> to respond to increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] concentrations is likely related to its greater sensitivity to drought (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>c,d). The increased growth of 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic>, on the other hand, is not accompanied by an increase in vulnerability to cavitation, further suggesting that 
 <italic class="italic">H. helix</italic> seems to take greater advantage of increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] than its tree host, as tree growth seemed to have been limited by the simultaneous rise in temperature and water stress.
