<p class="p">In recent years, there has been a large controversy about whether tree ring measurements can be used for evaluating historical growth patterns (Bowman, et al.

 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Brienen, Gloor, &amp; Zuidema, 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) because of the so‐called big‐tree selection bias and slow‐grower survivorship bias that may confound climate growth trends with population dynamics or sampling strategies (Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34388-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). A central aspect of both biases is the unbalanced relationship between age and annual growth in the sampled population, resulting in a spurious positive trend in growth produced by the different composition of slow‐ and fast‐growing trees in each sampled age class (Brienen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information</xref>). We found no significant correlation between age and mean annual growth in our samples (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34388-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Therefore, we do not expect these biases to influence our results. We also do not expect substantial disturbance or logging to have occurred in our study area, which has been protected since 1997. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that our forests are recovering from some old disturbance, the well‐distributed samples across the landscape and their consistency make this unlikely.
