<p class="p">In this study, we examined the relationship between physiological variation and the disparity in geographic range sizes exhibited among closely‐related species of salamanders. Thermal acclimation may enable a species to occupy more seasonal habitats, and is thought to be an important factor determining life histories and distributions of species (Angilletta, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Feder, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>). Some even argue that acclimation ability may be more important than thermal tolerances in determining vulnerability to climate change (Stillman, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Here, we find a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow‐ranging temperate salamanders. Wide‐ranging species maintain or increase metabolic rate when acclimated at a higher temperature, whereas many narrow‐ranging species show significant metabolic depression at higher test and acclimation temperatures. In addition, we find a significant relationship between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range at the species‐level, but little evidence at the population level within species. These strong species‐level results support predictions of the climate variability hypothesis and indicate that acclimation ability could have played a major role in the latitudinal range expansion of wide‐ranging salamander species. Finally, as narrow‐ranging salamander species are found to have lower tolerance to high temperature, low acclimation ability, restricted distributions, and little access to alternative habitats, they are likely at higher risk of extinction in association with anthropogenic climate warming.
