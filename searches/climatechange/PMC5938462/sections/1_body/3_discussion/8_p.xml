<p class="p">Another consideration includes differences in habitat use between species that may contribute to disparities in temperature experienced. Most 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> species are associated with riparian habitats and may be buffered from thermal extremes. To control for this, genus (
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> vs. 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic>) was added as a covariate to several of the analyses. While genus is found to be a significant factor, the overall results remain unchanged when it is included. Between the two groups, there is found to be a stronger association between acclimation ability and temperature range for 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> over 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> species. However, the data points for 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> salamanders are not found to be outliers and follow the expected pattern of more terrestrial salamanders. The lesser association does indicate though that some temperature buffering may be occurring in certain individuals/populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> salamanders.
