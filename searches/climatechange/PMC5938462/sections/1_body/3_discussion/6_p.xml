<p class="p">Physiological tolerances are expected to evolve quite rapidly under selection to environmental temperature, and should be differentiated across a latitudinal range (see Bozinovic et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1975</xref>). While we find evidence for this when data are combined for all species, within species, there are few clear relationships between acclimation ability and thermal regimes. The only species to demonstrate a significant relationship between acclimation capacity and thermal range is 
 <italic class="italic">D. ochrophaeus</italic>. While we did not sample the entire latitudinal extent of these species, we still fail to see a clear pattern in wide‐ranging species such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> where 10 populations were tested and thermal range varies by over 7°C between populations. As salamanders have very small home ranges and low dispersal rates (Petranka, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Wells, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), there is good potential for rapid local adaptation. However, studies of amphibians and other taxa (Brattstrom, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1968</xref>; Hoffmann &amp; Watson, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) have also found little within species variation in thermal tolerances. The lack of among‐population variation could potentially be the result of the dynamic climatic history in North America, offering opportunities for both range expansions and contractions (Parmesan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Pielou, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). The New World temperate zone is the center of origin for plethodontids, with the clade more recently colonizing and radiating in the New World tropics (Wake &amp; Lynch, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1976</xref>; reviewed in Kozak, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Plethodontid lineages that radiated rapidly into different thermal regimes could have done so by gaining adaptive physiological ability over other close relatives with similar ecologies. Therefore, rapid expansion of leading‐edge populations with broad tolerances may help to explain the lack of among‐population variation within wide‐ranging species (Sage &amp; Wolff, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>; Zink &amp; Dittmann, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>).
