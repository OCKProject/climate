<p class="p">Narrow‐ranging montane species, in particular, are seemingly more sensitive to warm temperatures, and several species in this study were found to suffer metabolic depression at the higher test and acclimation temperatures. In fact, there are already indications that some montane salamander species are living in temperatures that reach the limits of their physiological tolerances (Bernardo &amp; Spotila, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gifford &amp; Kozak, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). For species with limited tolerance to warm temperatures, even moderate increases in heat can have large affects on physiological systems. High temperatures can impair enzymatic function and disrupt membrane structure, causing decreased locomotion ability, digestive inefficiencies, and reduced growth (Angilletta, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Hillman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). For lungless salamanders, cutaneous respiration on its own may not provide sufficient oxygen at warmer temperatures (Whitford, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>; Whitford &amp; Hutchison, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>). Ultimately, warming‐induced stress can lower the fitness and survival of individuals. The inability of species to disperse across warm, dry valleys may further increase the risk of extinction for narrow‐ranging montane species. Not only is the suitable habitat of their current geographic ranges likely to contract with global temperature rise, but impeded dispersal can lead to genetic erosion and population decline (Bernardo &amp; Spotila, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Calosi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Gifford &amp; Kozak, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Reductions in surface activity may offer some reprieve from temperature extremes, but salamanders may be especially sensitive to rapid or prolonged changes in their environment (Huey &amp; Stevenson, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>). Further, with climate change the geographic ranges of competitors and predators may extend further upslope into the ranges of montane species, adding pressure to species already under stress (Bernardo &amp; Spotila, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gifford &amp; Kozak, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). How a species will ultimately fare when faced with global temperature rise will depend on the plasticity and strength of their thermal tolerances, their ability to adapt, and their accessibility to alternative suitable habitat (Davis &amp; Shaw, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Kozak &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
