<p class="p">Finally, one question that remains is whether there are any evident trade‐offs or relationships in physiological traits for these species of salamanders. Stillman (
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) proposes that species that have evolved the greatest tolerances to high temperatures may have done so at the expense of acclimation capacity. However, similar to the results of Calosi et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), we find that species with the lowest tolerances to warm temperatures (measured as CTMax) also have the poorest acclimation ability to warm temperatures. This relationship suggests that both traits are potentially good predictors of how a salamander species may respond to climatic change and further highlights the vulnerability of narrow‐ranging salamanders to global temperature increase (Calosi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Not only do these species have lower tolerances to high temperatures, but they also have a lesser ability to acclimate to a warming climate.
