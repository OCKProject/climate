<p class="p">Conversely, many temperate amphibians (including salamanders) are adapted for activity at mild/cooler temperatures and have field body temperatures below 20°C (Brattstrom, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1963</xref>; Feder &amp; Lynch, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>; Kozak &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Physiological specialization to cooler habitats has been hypothesized to constrain the evolution of broad geographic ranges and to limit lowland dispersal (Bernardo &amp; Spotila, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gilchrist,

 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> inhabit a wide range of elevations, recent work suggests that the ancestor of this group was restricted to a montane climate (Kozak &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thermal acclimation would have little value in more stable thermal environments, and selection for acclimation ability would be discouraged if it comes at a cost (Feder, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>). Therefore, the relative stability of higher elevations may limit opportunities for cool‐adapted salamanders to expand into warmer habitats (Gifford &amp; Kozak, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
