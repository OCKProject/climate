<p class="p">Our MCMCglmm analyses of the full data set revealed significant two‐way interactions between acclimation temperature and geographic range size (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.004 for both latitudinal extent and wide vs. narrow‐ranging species). Results show that wide‐ranging salamander species increase metabolic rates from low to high acclimation temperatures, whereas narrow‐ranging species have a drop in SMR at the higher acclimation temperature (Figure
