<p class="p">At the species‐level, SMR results and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>‐tests revealed some trends of interest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34006-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), with results of particular interest being found at the higher test temperatures (15 and 25°C), as this is where there is the greatest response of warm temperature acclimation. For wide‐ranging species, the majority of species are found to show little difference in metabolic rate between acclimation temperatures. 
 <italic class="italic">D. monticola</italic> acclimated at 22°C, however, has a statistically significant increase in SMR at the 25°C test temperature (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.00039). For the narrow‐ranging species, four of the nine species (
 <italic class="italic">D. orestes, P. montanus, P. punctatus,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. richmondi</italic>) acclimated at 22°C show a significant drop in SMR at the 25°C test temperature (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐values all &lt; .05). These results indicate that several of the narrow‐ranging species in this study appear to be very sensitive to warm temperatures and exhibit metabolic depression, whereas no wide‐ranging species have a significant drop in metabolic rate at higher test/acclimation temperatures.
