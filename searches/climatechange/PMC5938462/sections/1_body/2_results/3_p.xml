<p class="p">When tested within range size group, MCMCglmm analyses reveal that for wide‐ranging species acclimated at the higher temperature, there is a significant decrease in metabolic rate at the 5°C test temperature (

 <xref rid="ece34006-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a) compared to those acclimated at a lower temperature. At the 25°C test temperature, there is no change in SMR for salamanders acclimated at the higher temperature, with the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value falling just outside of the significance level (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.058). While the overall trend for wide‐ranging species is a slight increase in metabolic rate for species acclimated at the higher temperature of 22°C, the differences were minor and not significant at the 25°C test temperature. Narrow‐ranging species acclimated at 22°C are found to have significantly lower metabolic rates at test temperatures 5°C (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.004) and 25°C (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.004) compared to those acclimated at 14°C. The overall trend is for decreased metabolic rate for narrow‐ranging salamanders acclimated at the higher temperature, and this is quite pronounced at the highest test temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34006-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b).
