<p class="p">For acclimation ability versus thermal range of the environment across all species at the population level, we find there to be a significant positive relationship (
 <italic class="italic">p = </italic>.027, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .18), where mean acclimation ability of populations increases with increasing temperature range of the environment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34006-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In addition, mean acclimation ability of species is correlated with latitudinal extent (
 <italic class="italic">p = </italic>.0018, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .25, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34006-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Genus (
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> vs. 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic>) was included as a covariate in both analyses and was found to be significant (
 <italic class="italic">p = </italic>.0044 and 
 <italic class="italic">p = </italic>.0025, respectively). For 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> species, there is found to be a stronger association between acclimation ability and temperature range than in 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> species.
