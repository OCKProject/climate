<p class="p">Here, we ask whether wide‐ranging species of North American salamanders have a greater propensity for thermal acclimation than narrow‐ranging species and whether a relationship between acclimation ability and environmental temperature range can be found within and among species. We focus on 16 ecologically similar salamander species from the family Plethodontidae. These species vary greatly in geographic range size and their evolutionary relationships are well resolved (Kozak, Mendyk, &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), enabling results to be analyzed in a phylogenetic context. Using thermal tolerance data (measured as critical thermal maximum [CTMax]), we further test whether species with greater tolerance to heat have greater acclimation capacity at warmer temperatures, or whether as Stillman (
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) proposes, there are trade‐offs between these traits.
