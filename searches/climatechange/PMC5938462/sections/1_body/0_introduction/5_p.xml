<p class="p">It is anticipated that adaptation to local temperature gradients across the range should result in variation in acclimation ability within and between species (Angert, Sheth, &amp; Paul,

If individuals are rapidly adapting to thermal regimes, we should find a significant relationship between acclimation ability and temperature range of the environment at the population level of species (Bozinovic et al.,
