<p class="p">Evolutionary trade‐offs in physiological tolerances may also play an important role in determining species’ range limits, yet are rarely investigated (Calosi et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) found that porcellanid crabs with the greatest thermal limits had the lowest acclimation ability for those traits, and suggested that trade‐offs should exist between acclimation capacity and thermal tolerance. Calosi et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), however, find that in European diving beetles, those species with the lowest acclimation ability also had the lowest tolerance to warm temperatures. Thus, it remains unclear whether general relationships between acclimation ability and thermal tolerance exist across taxa.
