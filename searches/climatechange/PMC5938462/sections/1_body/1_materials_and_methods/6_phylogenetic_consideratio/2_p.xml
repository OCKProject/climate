<p class="p">Remaining statistical analyses do not have the phylogeny incorporated into the model as in earlier MCMCglmm analyses. As phylogenetic non‐independence may influence results in comparative analyses of multiple species, we need to test for the phylogenetic influence of measured traits (e.g., acclimation ability, CTMax, thermal range, latitudinal extent). Lambda tests were employed using “Fit Continuous” model tests in the “geiger” package of R (v.3.0.2, R Development Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In all cases, lambda was chosen as the best model with lambda scores for traits between 0.00 and 0.086. These low lambda values indicate that these particular traits have very little phylogenetic signal, enabling us to use the original data without further concern for phylogenetic influence.
