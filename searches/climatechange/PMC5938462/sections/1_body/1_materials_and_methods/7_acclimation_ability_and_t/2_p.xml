<p class="p">To better assess the relationship between physiological tolerances and local thermal environments, we estimated the thermal range of localities for each species and performed linear regressions between acclimation ability versus environmental thermal range and acclimation ability versus latitudinal extent. Acclimation ability was defined as any positive increase in VO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from lower to higher acclimation temperatures, using VO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 22°C acclimation minus VO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 14°C acclimation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34006-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Any increase in VO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for individuals acclimated at a higher temperature indicates acclimation capacity, whereas any decrease was considered metabolic depression. Only SMR data at the 25°C test temperature were used to determine warm temperature acclimation ability, as this is where we find the greatest influence of temperature on acclimation.
