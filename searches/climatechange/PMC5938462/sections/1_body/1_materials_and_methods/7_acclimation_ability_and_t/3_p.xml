<p class="p">To approximate the annual thermal range of each locality sampled, thermal data (averages 1950–2000) were obtained from the Worldclim online database at 1 km

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) was used to georeference and map salamander localities. Data were then extracted for the bioclimatic variable Bio 7 (temperature annual range), which represents air temperature of the local area. Salamanders are found to conform quickly to the temperature of their environment and air temperature has been found to be a good proxy of operative conditions actually experienced by terrestrial salamanders (Lunghi et al.,
