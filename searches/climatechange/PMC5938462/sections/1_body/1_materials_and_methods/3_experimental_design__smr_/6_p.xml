<p class="p">Once all trials were complete for individuals at a given acclimation temperature, salamanders were given a minimum of 4 weeks at 14°C before being acclimated at the remaining temperature. Each individual, therefore, had a total of six trials (5, 15, and 25°C at each acclimation treatment of 14 and 22°C). Our experimental design attempted to control for many of the extrinsic factors that can affect metabolic rate, for example, feeding, photoperiod, acclimation length, activity, season, and reproductive state (see Feder et al.,
