<p class="p">As SMR is meant to capture the metabolic rate of animals at rest (Fitzpatrick et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), measurements were taken between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., during the time when nocturnal salamanders would naturally be inactive. As salamanders inhabit underground retreats or spaces beneath rocks and logs during the day, they are well suited to dark, moist respirometer vessels. Test chambers were small enough to limit movement and salamanders are assumed to remain inactive for the most part (Feder et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>). Salamanders were allowed to habituate inside the test chambers for the first hour, and as such, data from this period were not included in the analysis. From the remaining runs, the mean of the lowest two VO
