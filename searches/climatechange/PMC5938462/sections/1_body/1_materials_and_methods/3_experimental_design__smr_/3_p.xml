<p class="p">To approximate SMR, we recorded oxygen consumption (VO

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Automated closed‐system respirometry (Sable Systems International, Hendersonville, NV, USA) was used to measure oxygen consumption at three test temperatures of 5, 15, and 25°C. As diet influences metabolic rate, salamanders were not fed for 7 days prior to the start of the first respirometry trial (Feder et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>). Oxygen consumption measurements were made at one temperature per day, with the order of test temperature assigned randomly to individuals and alternating every week. For each trial, a random assortment of salamander species were placed inside individual tubes (with two‐way stopcocks) within a digitally controlled incubator. Up to seven animals could be measured during the same trial, with each chamber recording independently. An empty chamber identical to the others was used as the baseline and control.
