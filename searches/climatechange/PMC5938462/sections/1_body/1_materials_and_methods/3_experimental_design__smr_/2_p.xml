<p class="p">Conspecific salamanders were sorted by weight and then split randomly into two equivalent groups to be acclimated for a minimum of 3 weeks at 14°C or 22°C. Consistent with acclimation timelines in other amphibian studies, this time period should ensure full acclimation to these temperatures (see Feder,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1961</xref>). Environmental chambers maintained air temperature within 1°C of the desired acclimation temperature. Acclimation temperatures are representative of fairly typical late spring through early fall evening temperatures that surface‐active salamanders within each range would experience (Brattstrom,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>), although 22°C would be at the higher end for some montane endemics. Only sexually mature male and female salamanders were included in the analyses, however, gravid salamanders were not used. Juveniles were not considered as they have been found to have different physiological tolerances from adults in other amphibians (Lunghi, Manenti, &amp; Ficetola,

 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Sample sizes per species ranged from 6 to 44, with larger samples collected from across the range of wide‐ranging species and smaller samples from very restricted species. The summed total was 297 salamanders (see Table
