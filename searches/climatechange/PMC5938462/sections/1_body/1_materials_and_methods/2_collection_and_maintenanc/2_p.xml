<p class="p">Live salamanders were collected throughout the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America from 2009 to 2012. Sixteen species of plethodontid salamanders representing four clades were examined: the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus,</italic> the 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> group, the 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon glutinosus</italic> group, and the 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon wehrlei</italic> group (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34006-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The family Plethodontidae represents a diverse group of lungless salamanders and the phylogenetic relationships among species in this study are strongly supported based on phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial‐ and nuclear‐DNA sequences (Kozak et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Species were chosen to represent a wide variety of range sizes, body sizes, and habitat types. 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> salamanders typically inhabit terrestrial habitats, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> salamanders are more often found in association with seepages and streams (Petranka, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Mature salamanders were collected from throughout the latitudinal extent of each species’ range.
