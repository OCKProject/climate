<p class="p">Further, additional MCMCglmm analyses were performed where data were grouped separately by range size into wide and narrow‐ranging species. This grouping enabled examination of the affect of acclimation temperature on SMR within each group (wide and narrow‐ranging) and for each test temperature (5, 15, 25°C). Acclimation (14 and 22°C) was included as a fixed factor, while sex remained as a covariate. 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐tests were also performed on each species for each test and acclimation temperature, to determine which species showed evidence of thermal acclimation or metabolic depression.
