<p class="p">To determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide and narrow‐ranging species when acclimated at different temperatures, we ran a phylogenetically controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) with repeated measures (Hadfield, 
 <xref rid="ece34006-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). MCMCglmm uses a Bayesian approach to fit general linear models and includes the phylogenetic variance–covariance matrix as a random effect in the regression model, allowing for any genetic influences in the data to be accounted for.
