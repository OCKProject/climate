 <sub class="sub">2</sub> included: test temperature (5, 15, 25°C), acclimation temperature (14 and 22°C), and range size (latitudinal extent, as well as species grouped as wide vs. narrow‐ranging). To assign species as wide or narrow‐ranging, a natural break was found between species with latitudinal extents greater than or less than five degrees of latitude. Sex and genus were also included as covariates in the model. As 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> salamanders are often associated with streams and seeps, they could be better buffered from temperature extremes than more terrestrial 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> salamanders. This could have a potential influence on salamander physiological tolerances and SMR. The covariate “genus” therefore divides 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> from 
 <italic class="italic">Desmognathus</italic> to help to control for differences in thermal habitat associated with each group.
