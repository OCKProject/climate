<p class="p">As individual salamanders were used in multiple trials, an additional random effect was included in the model to account for repeated measures of individuals. The initial model included several interactions (test temperature × acclimation temperature, test temperature × range size, acclimation temperature × range size, and test temperature × acclimation temperature × range size), however, the three‐way interaction, as well as the two‐way interactions for test temperature × acclimation temperature and test temperature × range size and had 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐values &gt;.3 and were removed from the model. Our priors took the form of: prior &lt;‐list(G = list(G1 = list(V = diag(2), nu = 2, alpha.mu = c(0,0), alpha.V = diag(2) × 1,000)), R = list(V = diag(1), nu = 0.002)), where a 2 × 2 covariance matrix is being estimated for the random effects (G) and a scalar variance for the residuals (R). Using trace plots, we observed the distribution of samples to remain stationary over time, therefore giving us confidence that our posterior is a good approximation of the true distribution. For optimal outcomes, we ran the analysis for 300,000 iterations, with 25,000 samples of burn‐in, and sampling every 1,000th generation.
