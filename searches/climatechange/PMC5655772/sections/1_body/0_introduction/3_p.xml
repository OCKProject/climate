<p class="p">Current management relies on nematicides, resistant potato cultivars and long‐crop rotations. However, several nematicides have recently been banned under current EU legislation (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009). There are few cultivars grown widely with high levels of resistance particularly to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>. Early success in breeding resistance to 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> was achieved with a single gene from 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">andigena</italic>. It has provided durable, qualitative resistance to this nematode in cultivars such as Maris Piper. Breeding for resistance to the more common forms of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> is more complex. No single gene offers complete resistance to all populations of this nematode which vary in the level of virulence they offer to partially resistant cultivars (Dalton, Griffin, Gallagher, de Vetten, &amp; Milbourne,
