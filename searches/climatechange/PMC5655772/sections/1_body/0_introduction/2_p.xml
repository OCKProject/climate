<p class="p">Climate change has the potential to alter the distribution of animals, but outcomes can vary. In the absence of habitat management, it may result in future extinction of some species, as reported for drought‐sensitive butterflies in the United Kingdom (Oliver et al.,

They cause losses to potato harvests estimated at £50 m/year in the United Kingdom alone and several times that value across Europe (
