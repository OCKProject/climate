<p class="p">The difference in the altitude adaptation of the two PCN species in the Andes, together with previous work, suggested a comparative approach for this study to define if their likely responses differ to the future increase in summer temperatures that have been projected for the United Kingdom (Jenkins et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Being soil borne, nematodes respond to soil rather than air temperature. As soil temperatures are rarely recorded and are not outputted from global climate models, modelling studies tend to use air instead of soil temperatures. García‐Suárez and Butler (
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) showed for three sites in Ireland that over the last century annual mean soil temperatures increased more than air temperature, and rises and falls do not occur at the same time. To represent recent and future soil temperatures for 10 sites across the UK potato‐growing area (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) for UK conditions. The soil temperature model was used together with recent and future climate data from a weather generator for medium‐ and high‐emission scenarios and three future time periods (

Female reproductive success of PCN at 15 to 25°C was determined and related to predicted future soil temperatures during time of female development for 10 sites covering the main potato‐growing areas of the United Kingdom. This enabled changes in pest status of PCN on UK potato crops in relation to climate change to be estimated.
