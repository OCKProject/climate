<p class="p">PCN are host‐specific parasites that co‐evolved over 15–21 × 10

 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The climate of the Andean highlands pre‐adapted both the two PCN species and their host potato plants to cool‐temperate climates worldwide where the crop is now grown. 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> is adapted to high altitudes and is considered to have undergone an expansion northwards within Peru in the Miocene as the Andean chain rose in that region. Phylogenetic analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> populations has been used as a molecular clock to determine when an altitude threshold of 2.0–2.5 km was reached for the elevating Andes in different regions of Peru. 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> is assumed to originate from where uplift of the paleo Andes was less extreme, and therefore, the climate is slightly warmer (Plantard et al.,
