<p class="p">The females of both 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> species retain all eggs within a cyst formed by tanning of their body walls at death. There is normally a single generation per potato crop, and the encysted eggs remain dormant until infective juveniles hatch from them in response to root diffusate from potato plants (Forrest &amp; Farrer,

 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). A partial second generation has been observed for some populations of

 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1950</xref>) and Italy (Greco, Brandonisio, Tirro, &amp; de Marinis, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Potatoes are grown widely in England and Scotland with planting of main crops from mid‐April and harvest up to early October (Daccache et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Gregory &amp; Marshall, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). More than half the national potato plantings occur in Eastern England and Yorkshire, about 22% in Scotland, about 12% in the West Midlands and the remaining 14% in other parts of England and Wales. Females develop after the juveniles invade potato roots. They emerge through the cortex onto the root surface and continue to grow on main crop potatoes in the United Kingdom from June onwards. For example, first emergence of females onto the root surface occurred in Southern England in late June, 55 days after planting in early May (Whitehead, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>) and mid‐June for early planted potatoes in Belgium (Ebrahimi, Viaene, Demeulemeester, &amp; Moens,
