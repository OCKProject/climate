<p class="p">The effect of temperature between 15 and 25°C on female reproductive success differed between 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. Both number of females per plant and final female size and hence number of eggs per plant were reduced progressively for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> at temperatures above 17.5°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). In contrast, the number of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> females developing on potato was only suppressed above 22.5°C with no decrease in female final size over 15–25°C. This differential effect on number of eggs/g soil produced by the two species was also evident from comparing reproductive success at 15, 22.5 and 25°C on cv Desiree and Maris Peer (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). The reduction in reproduction of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> was of particular interest in relation to projected future UK summer temperatures and was found to be host independent for seven cultivars studied (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b).
