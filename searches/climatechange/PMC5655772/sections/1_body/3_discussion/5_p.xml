<p class="p">The SoilClim model simulates the recorded soil temperature accurately at East Malling and Rothamsted for all seven years compared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). This suggests that it provides a useful basis for future projections in conjunction with the weather generator that enabled a spatial resolution of 5 × 5 km. This scale is sufficient for estimating regional effects within the United Kingdom. The projected increases in soil temperature during June and July (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>) are in agreement with studies that have investigated past and future trends in soil temperature. Projected increases are at the low end compared to past observed annual soil temperature trends at 30 cm depth in Scotland that reported an increase of 0.30°C per decade (Gregory &amp; Marshall, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Assuming the trend continues into the future, this would equate to an increase of about 1.8 to 2.4°C between the recent time period (1961–1990) and the 2040s. Trends in summer temperature were reported to be higher than trends for annual average soil temperatures for two of three sites in Ireland (García‐Suárez &amp; Butler, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The same was found for some northern forest sites where projected annual mean soil temperatures increased between 1.9 and 3.3°C from the 1971–2000 to the period 2070–99 but increases up to 5.0°C were projected during June (Houle, Bouffard, Duchesne, Logan, &amp; Harvey,
