<p class="p">No cultivars with high levels of resistance to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> are currently widely grown. Resistant cultivars Innovator and Arsenal are limited to the chipping market in the United Kingdom (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk/promotion/chip-skills/Potato-Varieties-Guide" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk/promotion/chip-skills/Potato-Varieties-Guide</ext-link>). Future control of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> would be assisted by cultivars able to withstand future climate change effects in the current growing areas in the south of the United Kingdom. Potato planting may remain at the same time of year because of other husbandry constraints (Brown, Towers, Rivington, &amp; Black, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Gregory &amp; Marshall, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). If a shift in planting potatoes towards earlier dates occurs in the future, this would place the start of female development into May. The soil temperatures during May would favour 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> as they are cooler than in June and July with the median of the mean monthly soil temperature at or below 17.5°C until the 2040s for all sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). Potato yields in England are predicted to increase from approximately 2.9 to 6.5% by mid‐century due to warmer temperatures, assuming current nitrogen management and unconstrained water availability. Current irrigation schemes will not meet needs to achieve future yields in approximately 50% of years with 14 to 30% more water required by mid‐century (Daccache et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The importance of PCN will be increased if the crop experiences water stress more often as the parasite reduces water acquisition by the root system (Fatemy &amp; Evans, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). A shift to the north and west would lessen irrigation demands (Downing et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), but the effect may be slow because of the investment levels required of successful potato growers (Daccache et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
