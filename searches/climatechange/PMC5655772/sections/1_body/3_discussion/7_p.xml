<p class="p">Combining the data in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> with the climate change effects suggests a differential effect on the two species. Multiplication of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> in the six most southern sites is estimated to be reduced by approximately 30%, 40–50% and 50–60% in 2040s, 2050s and 2080s for the high‐emission scenario (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a indicates that the reduction in the southern sites might be somewhat lower than presented here, but both data agree on a negative trend. In contrast, similar increases in reproductive success are predicted for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> for the same period and conditions but with higher variation between sites. The effect of an increase in mean temperature in the four most northern sites cannot be estimated as current levels were below 15°C and therefore outside the range of the growth experiments. As the medians of future mean soil temperature are between 15 and 20°C, it is anticipated to be insufficient to have either a detrimental effect on 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> or to favour 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. Our results suggest that further work to add a soil temperature parameter to PCN management models (e.g. AHDB Potatoes,

To do this, future work should focus on extending our analysis to distinguish different soil types and to perform tests under field conditions.
