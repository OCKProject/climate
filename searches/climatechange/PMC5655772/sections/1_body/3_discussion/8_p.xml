<p class="p">Unlike 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> G. rostochiensis</italic> maintained its capacity to multiply at 22.5°C (Figures 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and completed a generation in 6–7 weeks postinfection of J2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). A partial if not full second generation was indicated both by the recovery of more cysts at 16 weeks compared to nine weeks postinfection and by the presence of cysts collected at the second time point with low egg content for their size (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Some populations of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> in both the United Kingdom (Evans, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1969</xref>; Jones, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1950</xref>) and Italy (Greco et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) show a less than complete entry into dormancy of the first generation of eggs and succeed in completing a partial second generation on potato crops. Multiple generations occur for another cyst nematode, 
 <italic class="italic">Heterodera schachtii</italic> on the sugar beet crop, which has a more prolonged growing season than potato plants. 
 <italic class="italic">Heterodera schachtii</italic> can achieve up to five generations per crop in the warm conditions of the Imperial Valley of California but only typically two generations in the cooler soils that prevail in Northern Europe (Thomason &amp; Fife, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1962</xref>). The pest status of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> would increase with climate change in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe if a partial second generation became a common response to climate change. This species can be managed by frequent deployment of the qualitative resistance that is present in widely grown cultivars assuming it remains avirulent to that plant defence.
