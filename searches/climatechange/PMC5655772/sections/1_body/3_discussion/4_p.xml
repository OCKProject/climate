<p class="p">The aim of exposing developing females of 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> to diurnal fluctuations from 17.5°C to up to 32.5°C for one week was to examine the likely effect of short periods of high ambient temperatures. Diurnal fluctuations had a significant effect on the development of growing females of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> measured one week after this heat stress, but some recovery was evident after a further week. This suggests short periods of high temperature do not suppress multiplication of this species in contrast to sustained high temperatures above about 17.5°C. As previously shown, 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> has a higher thermal optima compared to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and diurnal fluctuations from 17.5 to 32.5°C had no significant effect on the development of growing females for this species at either time point during recovery.
