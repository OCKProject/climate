<p class="p">It is generally assumed that PCN was introduced from S. America to Europe in about 1850. Consequently, with a single generation per potato crop and a common rotation of 3–7 years in the United Kingdom (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk/sites/default/files/publication_upload/pcnOfficialControlProgramme.pdf" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk/sites/default/files/publication_upload/pcnOfficialControlProgramme.pdf</ext-link>), there have only been about 25 to 60 generations in the country for the founding populations. The limited number of generations may explain the continued optimal temperature difference of the two species as defined during their co‐evolution with Solanaceae in S. America over 15–21 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> years. Some animals are likely to overcome the impact of climate change by range changes (Hof, Levinsky, AraÚJo, &amp; Rahbek, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), but this does not apply to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> because it is already present throughout much of the United Kingdom (Minnis et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The prevailing consensus is that climate change normally outpaces microevolution processes that enable the adaptation required to remain at some localities (Hof et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Exceptions include 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia magna</italic> which has a rapid life cycle and lives in shallow pools susceptible to changes in water temperature. The planktonic crustacean showed a 2°C increase in the maximum temperature at which it shows locomotor activity over a two‐year period (Geerts et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). It seems unlikely that 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> will have a similar capacity to achieve such rapid microevolution given its infrequent reproduction.
