<p class="p">The reduced number of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> females developing may arise from less efficient root invasion, mortality of developing females or a higher proportion of males in unfavourable conditions as sex is determined by environmental conditions in planta (Perry, Wright, &amp; Chitwood, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). It seems unlikely to arise from differences in hatch, as there is no substantial effect for either species over the range studied in the recent work by Kaczmarek, Mackenzie, Kettle, and Blok (
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Furthermore, number of developing females was also reduced at the higher temperature for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> when hatched J2s were applied directly to the soil (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). It could relate to the known differential temperature effects on endogenous lipid reserves used for mobility and root invasion by this nonfeeding stage (Robinson, Atkinson, &amp; Perry, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>). The small, significant reduction in fecundity must occur after sex determination and suggests suboptimal conditions for the feeding female. Our results for female development are consistent with previous work that suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> has a slightly higher thermal optimum (for both number of females and number of eggs per female) compared to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> (Berry, Stone, Parrott, &amp; Edwards, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>). A higher optimum temperature for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> has also been found for hatch of its infective juveniles (Foot, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>; Franco, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>; Kaczmarek et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Robinson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>). Overall, the results from our study and previous studies establish a preference for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> for a lower temperature range compared to 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>.
