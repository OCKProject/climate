<p class="p">The increase in frequency of mean soil temperatures above 17.5°C was evident for the six most southern UK sites with both the medium‐ and high‐emission scenarios for July and for June in the latter case. Such temperatures have an adverse effect on the reproductive success of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>. The four most northern sites have a lower recent temperature range, and so the increase caused by climate change may not be sufficient to raise soil temperatures to an adverse range for this species. The recent mean soil temperatures in both June and July for all sites are frequently below 17.5°C and are predicted to infrequently exceed 22.5°C under either the medium‐ or high‐emission scenario. The optimal temperature range for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> is 17.5–22.5°C suggesting climate change in the United Kingdom will benefit the reproductive success of this species in many years. The SoilClim simulations used for the analysis assume a canopy that has not been affected by nematodes, but some reduction is to be expected by damaging population densities. A less dense canopy would increase temperature fluctuations in summer months that may be sufficient to favour 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> relative to 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>.
