<p class="p">Soil temperature at 10 and 20 cm depth was simulated using SoilClim (Hlavinka et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) which requires daily minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, radiation, latitude and altitude of the location as input data. All SoilClim simulations were performed for light and medium soils (Trnka et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) with notional planting and harvest dates in mid‐April and early October (Daccache et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Gregory &amp; Marshall, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Soil temperature was simulated for all combinations of a constant (3 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and variable canopy, with or without irrigation. For the variable canopy, the total amount of biomass cover was increased linearly from 0 to 18 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> during the initial crop development once it had emerged. It was maintained at 18 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> during mid‐season before a decrease from 18 to 10 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the late season. Irrigation was simulated by maintaining readily available water at a minimum of 40% until increased by rainfall (Daccache, Weatherhead, Stalham, &amp; Knox, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The length of the different potato plant developmental stages was set at 40 days for emergence, 60 days for crop development, 45 days for mid‐season and 28 days for late season (
