<p class="p">For the validation of SoilClim, two weather stations (Rothamsted and East Malling) from the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS) Land and Marine Surface Station Data were selected that provided hourly soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm and daily values for minimum and maximum air temperature and precipitation. Daily soil temperature data were computed from the hourly observations to compare to the SoilClim output. Using hourly observed soil temperature for comparison was necessary as daily soil temperature data at the MIDAS weather stations are recorded at 9 am and therefore do not correspond to daily average values. Solar radiation was not available and was therefore calculated from minimum and maximum air temperature (Hargreaves, Hargreaves, &amp; Riley,

No suitable data set could be found for soil temperatures at a depth of 20 cm. For the simulations, a light and medium soil type in combination with a constant canopy was assumed as satellite images confirmed that both sites had a grass cover.
