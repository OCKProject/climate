 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> L. var. Desiree were grown in a Sanyo
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> MLR‐350H Plant Growth Chamber (Moriguchi, Osaka prefecture, Japan) at 17.5°C with 16‐hr day length for three weeks before J2 of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> (pathotype Pa 2/3) or 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> (pathotype Ro1) were added to the soil as above. After further four weeks, six plants infected with each species were moved to a plant growth chamber with a cycling diurnal temperature. The remaining three plants for each species continued at a constant temperature of 17.5°C. The cabinets with cycling temperatures increased to a maximum value of 32.5°C over 4–5 hr and held the maximum temperature for 3–4 hr before the temperature fell over 4–5 hr to 17.5°C which was maintained for the remaining 12–13 hr of the 24‐hr cycle. The 8‐hr dark period occurred, whilst the plants were at 17.5°C. After one week, all plants were returned to the cabinet set at a constant temperature of 17.5°C and females were collected from the roots at six and seven weeks post nematode addition.
