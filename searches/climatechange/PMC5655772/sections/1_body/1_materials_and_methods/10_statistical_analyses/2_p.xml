<p class="p">All data were analysed using a standard statistical package (SPSS v20; IBM Corporation Armonk, NY, USA;

Curve fits in regression analysis were selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC, extractAIC function from

This combines the goodness of fit of a model and its complexity. Nonlinear regression was used to fit Gompertz curves to changes in projected surface areas of females with time. 
 <sc class="sc">r</sc> version 3.1.2 was used for the analysis of the soil temperature data (
