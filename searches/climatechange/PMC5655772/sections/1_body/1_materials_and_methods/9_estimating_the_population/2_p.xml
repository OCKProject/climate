 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> pressure were calculated using our data for the effect of temperature on female development and population size, together with simulated soil temperature at 10 and 20 cm depth during female development. The potato root system is concentrated in the upper 30 cm of the soil layer (Asfary, Wild, &amp; Harris, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>), with PCN distribution proportional to root length density (Storey, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Therefore, we used estimates of root length density with depth to weight the simulated soil temperature. Soil layers 0 to 15 cm and 15 to 30 cm were assumed to correspond to SoilClim soil temperature estimates at 10 and 20 cm soil depth and were weighted 0.45 and 0.55, respectively (Asfary et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). The SoilClim simulations were based on a variable canopy with irrigation to provide realistic combinations for conditions experienced by PCN.
