<p class="p">At least three replicate plants per temperature were grown for each time point. Soil temperature in each pot was monitored using an iButton (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, California, USA) and was within ±1°C of the set mat temperature throughout the experiment. Females were collected from roots at weekly intervals, from their first appearance on the root surface at three weeks until nine weeks postinfection by washing them through a series of 1000‐, 150‐ and 63‐μm sieves. Images of females were taken using a Leica MZ16 stereo‐binocular microscope and a MicroPublisher 3.3 RTV colour camera (QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). Projected surface area was measured in mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> using Image‐Pro Analyzer 7.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The eggs within some newly formed cysts of both species were counted after measuring their projected surface area to provide a calibration curve that relates area to egg number.
