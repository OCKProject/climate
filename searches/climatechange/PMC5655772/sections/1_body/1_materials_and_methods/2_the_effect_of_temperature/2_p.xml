<p class="p">Tubers of 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> L. var. Desiree were grown in pots with a diameter of 18 cm containing sandy loam (1:1 loam soil:sand) in a glasshouse set at 20°C with a 16‐hr day length. Aliquots of 1,500 hatched, infective juveniles (J2s) of each species were added to the soil after three weeks of plant growth. Juveniles were hatched from 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> (pathotype Pa 2/3) or 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> (pathotype Ro1) eggs within cysts at 20°C using root diffusate collected from three‐week‐old potato roots. J2s were washed four times in tap water and pipetted into the soil at three locations around the planted tuber at a density of one juvenile per μL water. Immediately after soil infestation, the potato plants were transferred to heat mats set at 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5 and 25°C in a glasshouse with a 16‐hr day length.
