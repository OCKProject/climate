<p class="p">Tubers of nine potato cultivars widely grown in the United Kingdom (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> L. var. Arsenal, Cara, Desiree, Estima, Innovator, Markies, Melody, Maris Peer and Maris Piper) were planted and grown as described above with three or four replicates per temperature for each potato cultivar in soil containing 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> (pathotype Pa 2/3) at a density of 5 eggs g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The plants were grown on heat mats set at 15, 22.5 (all cultivars) and 25°C (Desiree and Maris Peer only) in a glasshouse with a 16‐hr day length. After twelve weeks of growth, plants and soil were allowed to dry. Roots and soil were mixed together, and three 100 g samples were collected from each pot. Egg and cyst counts were carried out using standard procedures by an agricultural extension company (ADAS UK Ltd, Wolverhampton, UK). Cysts were recovered from dried soil samples using a Fenwick can, they were opened and the number of eggs was quantified on a counting slide (see Southey
