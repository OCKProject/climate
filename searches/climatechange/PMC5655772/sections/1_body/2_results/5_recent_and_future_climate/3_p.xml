<p class="p">Daily soil temperatures were generally higher and more variable at 10 cm than 20 cm depth for both the recent and future simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>) with a greater effect for the light than the medium soil type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>). The medium soil type in combination with variable canopy and irrigation is the most prevalent combination for potato growing in the United Kingdom. With this combination, the mean soil temperature for the medium‐emission scenario increases at 10 cm (20 cm) from the recent to the 2040s by 1.9 to 2.7°C (1.8 to 2.6°C) for June at the ten different locations and 2.0 to 2.6°C (2.0 to 2.6°C) for July (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The corresponding values at 20 cm soil depth are 1.8 to 2.6°C and 2.0 to 2.6°C. Values for the 2040s and the high‐emissions scenario were similar. For the 2080s, mean increases in soil temperatures might reach 5.1 and 5.0°C for depths of 10 cm and 20 cm, respectively, in June with corresponding values of 5.8 and 5.6°C for July (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Differences in increases in mean soil temperature varied more depending on the canopy compared to irrigation effects (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). For both June and July, recent median soil temperatures were usually below 15°C for the northern sites and 15°C or slightly above 15°C elsewhere (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b, c). Even under the high‐emission scenario for the 2040s, the median of the majority of sites in June and all Scottish sites in July remains close to or below 17.5°C. By the 2080s, the median of all sites is above 17.5°C for both the high‐ and medium‐emission scenarios in July (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c and Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>b) although a difference between them remains.
