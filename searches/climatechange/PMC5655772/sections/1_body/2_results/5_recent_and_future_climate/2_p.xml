<p class="p">SoilClim simulated soil temperatures at 10 cm soil depth were validated using observed values from the MIDAS weather stations at Rothamsted and East Malling. Peaks and troughs of daily soil temperature at 10 cm depth were generally well estimated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>a, b). The goodness of fit between observed and simulated daily soil temperature ranged from

 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>c, d). Average air temperature for the potato‐growing season from mid‐April to early October was predicted to increase from the recent period by a mean of 1.9–2.4°C (depending on the location) by the 2040s with the medium‐emission scenario and to 3.9–5.0°C by the 2080s with the high‐emission scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>a). For the same period, total precipitation decreased by a mean of 8 to 31 mm for the 2040s for the medium‐emission scenario and by 22 to 58 mm for the 2080s for the high‐emission scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>b). The latter figure represented about 80% of the mean precipitation over the potato‐growing season during the recent years.
