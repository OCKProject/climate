<p class="p">The comparative reproductive success of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> at 15 and 22.5°C was studied for a further nine cultivars. The reduction in reproductive success for each cultivar is given in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b expressed as a percentage for each species at 22.5°C relative to their corresponding means at 15°C. Data collected for Arsenal and Innovator were excluded from the analysis due to low multiplication (&lt;1) on these cultivars at both temperatures. The overall reduction from the mean for the remaining seven cultivars at the higher temperature was 39 ± 4% cysts/100 g soil, 21 ± 4% eggs/cyst and 50 ± 4% eggs/g soil. The reduction from means at 15°C was significant (&lt;0.001 in all three comparisons, multivariate 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc>, pairwise comparisons, Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). There were no significant differences among cultivars for number of females or eggs/g soil (one‐way

 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). The reduction in eggs/cyst for Estima at 22.5°C was significantly greater than for Maris Peer, Markies and Maris Piper (SNK,
