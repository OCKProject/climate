<p class="p">The AIC method suggested the final projected surface area of female 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> fitted a quadratic rather than a linear fit. The change in final projected surface area of its females over 15 to 25°C was much smaller for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> than for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> that showed a clear reduction in projected surface area at higher temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Projected surface area at 25°C was reduced to 72 ± 10% of 0.165 ± 0.006 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at 15°C (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01; a priori contrasts, one‐way 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc>). The number of females per plant of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> fitted a quadratic curve (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>= 0.88) with optimal values of about 57 ± 6 at 17.5 to 22.5°C, whereas for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, the number decreased linearly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>= 0.90) from 66 ± 7 at 15°C to 15 ± 2% at 25°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). A linear relationship exists between the projected surface area of newly formed females of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and their egg content (Urwin, Atkinson, Waller, &amp; McPherson, 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). We found that there was no significant difference in this linear relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and therefore combined the data of the two species that resulted in the following equation: eggs/cyst = (1277.5 × area) – 37.1 with projected surface area in mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This calibration and number of females per plant enabled the number of eggs per plant at different temperatures to be estimated (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c).
