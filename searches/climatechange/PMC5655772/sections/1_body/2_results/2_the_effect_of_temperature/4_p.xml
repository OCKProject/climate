<p class="p">Reproductive success of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> decreased with temperature from 15 to 25°C, whereas the optimum for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> was between 17.5 and 22.5°C. The results establish that 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> reproduces more successfully than 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> at 15°C and is less productive at 20–22.5°C. Number of eggs/g soil produced by 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> on cv Desiree and Maris Peer at 15, 22.5 and 25°C is given in Figure

 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, the results for the two cultivars were similar and so were combined. There was a highly significant reduction in eggs/g soil between both 15 and 22.5°C and also between the latter temperature and 25°C (
