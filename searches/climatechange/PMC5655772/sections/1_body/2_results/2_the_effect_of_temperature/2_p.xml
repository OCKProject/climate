<p class="p">The mean projected surface areas of 2,899 and 2,398 collected females of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> respectively were measured over 3–9 weeks after adding juveniles to soil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Gompertz curves were fitted to the data set with a minimum lag of two weeks before the first females were present on the root surface (minimum value of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>= 0.77 except for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> at 25°C where 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>= 0.52). 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> fitted a longer lag phase at 15°C but reached the same final size as other temperatures by nine weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>a). The asymptote for females of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> provided a smaller final projected surface area at 25°C than other temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>b). There was no significant difference in the areas between eight and nine weeks for either species at each temperature (a priori contrasts, one‐way 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc>), indicating that growth had been completed for all temperatures by that time. The data for final size at eight and nine weeks were therefore combined.
