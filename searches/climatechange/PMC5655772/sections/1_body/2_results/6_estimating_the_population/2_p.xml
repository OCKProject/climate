<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows estimates of future 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> population trends across the UK potato‐growing area. It evaluates the median of the recent and future average June and July soil temperatures for the high‐emission scenario (as a weighted mean over 10 and 20 cm depths) and the effects of temperature on the two species (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, it indicates a percentage reduction in the number of eggs per plant of up to 60% for the six most southern sites. In contrast, increases of 40–70% are predicted for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> at the same sites. As the median soil temperature was below 15°C during the recent time period for the four most northern sites, these values need to be verified with experiments covering a broader temperature range than in the current study. Given the estimated relationship of number of eggs per plant in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c holds, accurate simulation of soil temperatures is crucial as the results differed significantly when a constant canopy was assumed for SoilClim (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S8</xref>a, b). Irrigation compared to no irrigation on the other hand did not change the results significantly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S8</xref>c). Interannual variability for mean June and July is high and increases in the future (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b, c) which indicates that some years will have a larger impact on 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic>.
