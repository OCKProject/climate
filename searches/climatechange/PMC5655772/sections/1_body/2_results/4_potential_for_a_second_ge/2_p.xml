<p class="p">The number of cysts/ 100 g soil was 6.75 ± 1.17 (mean ± 
 <italic class="italic">SEM</italic>) after nine weeks with a significantly higher value of 31.1 ± 6.58 after 16 weeks (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001; t test). Given that the number of cysts from the first generation of 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> is complete by 7–8 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>a), the increase suggests a second generation contributed to the cyst collection at 16 weeks. The ratio of observed to predicted eggs had a mean for the first harvest of 1.071 ± 0.028 and 1.081 ± 0.020 for the second harvest. The distribution of values about the mean for the second, but not the first harvest, had a significant negative skew (−0.946 ± 0.226, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 114, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01). Stem and leaf analysis suggested this was due to seven outliers with lower than expected observed egg content. Their exclusion eliminated the significant skew. These seven values are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13676-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> but are not included in the regression line for the second harvest.
