 <p class="p">The potato cyst nematodes 
  <italic class="italic">Globodera pallida</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> are economically important plant pathogens causing losses to 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UK</styled-content> potato harvests estimated at £50 m/ year. Implications of climate change on their future pest status have not been fully considered. Here, we report growth of female 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> over the range 15 to 25°C. Females per plant and their fecundity declined progressively with temperatures above 17.5°C for 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, whilst females per plant were optimal between 17.5 and 22.5°C for 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. Relative reproductive success with temperature was confirmed on two potato cultivars infected with either species at 15, 22.5 and 25°C. The reduced reproductive success of 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> at 22.5°C relative to 15°C was also recorded for a further seven host cultivars studied. The differences in optimal temperatures for reproductive success may relate to known differences in the altitude of their regions of origin in the Andes. Exposure of 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> to a diurnal temperature stress for one week during female growth significantly suppressed subsequent growth for one week at 17.5°C but had no effect on 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. However, after two weeks of recovery, female size was not significantly different from that for the control treatment. Future soil temperatures were simulated for medium‐ and high‐emission scenarios and combined with nematode growth data to project future implications of climate change for the two species. Increased soil temperatures associated with climate change may reduce the pest status of 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> but benefit 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> especially in the southern United Kingdom. We conclude that plant breeders may be able to exploit the thermal limits of 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> by developing potato cultivars able to grow under future warm summer conditions. Existing widely deployed resistance to 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> is an important characteristic to retain for new potato cultivars.
