<p class="p">With the HR as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00880-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, in combination with population [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and cause of death statistics [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], we calculate the potential changes in mortality due to the discussed changes in urban mobility for 2010. For those persons engaged in active mobility in each scenario, the number of deaths was determined from cause of death statistics, in proportion to the size of the group, to calculate the mortality rate before the additional exercise. Applying the HR reduces mortality accordingly, as the design of the study implies that the group would have already been engaged in such additional active mobility by the year 2010, with its corresponding health benefits e.g., reduced mortality risk. Data on Years of Life Lost (YLL), YLL is an indicator for lost years due to premature mortality, were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation database [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], but only for Austria as a whole. This necessitated calculation of a YLL per death ratio, which was applied for the three target cities to calculate the amount of YLL per city.
