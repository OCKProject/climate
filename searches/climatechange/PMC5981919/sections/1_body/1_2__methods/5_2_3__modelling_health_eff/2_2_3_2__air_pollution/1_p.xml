<p class="p">Based on the reduced exposure of the general public to air pollution, we calculate reduced morbidity and mortality figures for each city and scenario (in this case, the ZE scenario reduces health-relevant pollutants beyond the reductions of the GE scenario). We can perform this calculation similarly for all three most commonly used health-relevant air pollutants (PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) but it bears consideration that the reduced mortality for each of the pollutants cannot simply be summed up, as health effects are overlapping, meaning that a reduced case of death due to reduced NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> cannot be saved a second time via reduced PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>. Since these pollutants affect the same group and usually occur in combination, we can therefore only consider the strongest result for further calculations.
