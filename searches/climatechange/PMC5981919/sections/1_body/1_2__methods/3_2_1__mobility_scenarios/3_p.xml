This can be achieved by additional measures to promote active mobility (pedestrian and bike) and an expansion of access restrictions for cars in city centers combined with an expansion of public transport supply. In this scenario, domestic transport by cars is drastically reduced and commuter transport requires introduction of further incentives, such as price reductions for public transport.</p>
