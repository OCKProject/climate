<p class="p">For modelling the co-benefits for three types of scenarios in three Austrian cities, an interdisciplinary approach combining different model types has been applied. In general, we choose a comparative static approach. This means that the effects of any policy intervention on the transport system are compared to a case without such an intervention (
 <italic class="italic">ceteris paribus</italic>). We choose the year 2010 as a point of reference (“baseline”) and calculate changes in transport performance and mileage, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants relative to the baseline. Put differently, we assume that the policy intervention has already been achieved in 2010 and compare this hypothetical state to the baseline. Starting with the modal share targets of the local parliaments for the three cities, the Transport Modelling Tool (1, cf.

This output serves as an input for the transport Network Emission Model (NEMO) (2a), which calculates road transport emissions (pollutants) by applying a top-down approach for assigning transport parameters to the traffic grid. This output is then used in a highly resolved Lagrangian Dispersion Model (2b) to model changes in emissions and concentration levels of pollutants for different health-related pollutants while using meteorological data (e.g., wind) and detailed fleet parameters (cf.
