The tool is used to reach the overall modal share targets of the scenarios by shifting trips from one (motorized individual transport) to other groups (public transport, bicycle or pedestrian) within a certain distance category. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00880-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> illustrates for Vienna for the GM scenario that 65% of all very short car trips (up to 1 km) are shifted to other modes of transport, 8% thereof to pedestrian, 83% to bicycle, 7% to public transport and 1% to electric car and electric bike (pedelec) trips each. For each trip length category, the values are calibrated to meet the overall target shares of number of trips by mode as defined in the scenarios (
