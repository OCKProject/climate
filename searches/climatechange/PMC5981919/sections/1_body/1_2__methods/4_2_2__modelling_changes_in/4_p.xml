<p class="p">In addition, we estimated health co-benefits from changes in the physical activity of pedestrians, bicyclists and e-bike users. These health effects are usually presented in relation to the weekly number of minutes people do additional exercise. In determining such effects we therefore need to derive both the number of people with increased activity and their extra minutes in active motion, both from our Transport Modelling Tool. By assuming average velocities for the different active modes we can convert the extra mileage of walking and biking into extra minutes. For example, for the Green Exercise scenario in Vienna there are 250,000 people using a bike for their trips instead of a car, yielding an additional 214 minutes of biking per week. Detailed results for all cities are given in
