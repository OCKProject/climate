<p class="p">Regarding the direct costs for policy implementation we model (i) changes in private operating costs due to changes in transport behavior (e.g., less demand for fossil fuels and repair services but more demand for electricity), (ii) changes in private investments (e.g., more investment in electric cars and bike, but less in conventional cars), (iii) changes in public operating costs (e.g., higher costs for public transport) and (iv) changes in public investments (e.g., additional costs for civil engineering for railroads).</p>
