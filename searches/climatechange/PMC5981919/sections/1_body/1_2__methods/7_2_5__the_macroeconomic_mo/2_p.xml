The private household is endowed with the production factors labor and capital, which generate income when supplied to the market. This factor income (wages and capital income) is used by the household to maximize utility, subject to a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function. Production sectors use the supplied production factors and combine them together with other intermediate inputs (i.e., output from other sectors) to produce goods and services, also subject to a nested CES function. The government yields its income from taxation and spends it for public consumption, such as transport infrastructure, schools or the health system.
