<p class="p">The procedure to determine macroeconomic effects is the following: the baseline equilibrium (year 2011) in markets is exogenously shocked, e.g., by changes in transport-related expenditures by households, leading to changes in demanded quantities and consequently to changes in relative prices until a new equilibrium emerges (in which all markets are cleared again). By comparing model variables between the two equilibria (i.e., prior and after the shock), we capture the long-term effects for the whole economy but also for different sectors and end users. Again, note that we follow a comparative static approach.</p>
