<p class="p">Matching these data with data on population distribution yields the number of persons per district that are exposed to these changes in air quality. A second output of the Transport Modelling Tool refers to increased physical activity due to changes in modal share of trips (additional trips by bike, e-bike or foot), both affecting health. Based on changes of exposure of persons to emissions, relative risks obtained from literature (meta study) and changes in physical activity, the Health Model (3) calculates changes in morbidity and mortality for different diseases (i.e., cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, respiratory diseases and myocardial infarction). Thus two input arrows from two different models enter into the Health Model as can be seen in

This information is used for the Economic Assessment Tool (4) to calculate changes in private and public health costs as well as investment and operating costs for corresponding mitigation policies and in the macroeconomic CGE model (5). Finally, this CGE model calculates changes in employment, GDP and welfare using data of changed investment and operating costs and interrelated sectors as well as changes in health costs.
