<p class="p">As we are interested in a comprehensive evaluation of health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures, we also have to account for the associated costs of these measures. The costs are either one time investment costs (for the implementation of e.g., charging infrastructure) or recurring operating costs. In addition we account for who is bearing the different costs; either the public sector or private households.</p>
