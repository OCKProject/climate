 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Absolute numbers for YLD for the base year 2010 represent the years of life living with disability or the state of health within the population for this year. Thus we merge the costs for stationary stays (private and public) with the YLD for the year 2010. With the hence derived costs factor (€/YLD), decreases of YLD per disease produced by the Health Model are valued. As within the Health Model YLD changes can only be calculated for changed air quality, but not for changes in physical activity, effects of the latter are appraised by applying the results of Alt et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. These authors appraise the national costs of inactivity and the benefits for increased physical activity. They include direct and indirect health cost components and consider increased accidents due to increased activity which partly offset health benefits. Based on the number of active persons and the direct and indirect health costs for the base year derived from Alt et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], a cost factor (of €/active person) is calculated. This factor is multiplied with the changes in the amount of active persons due to a switch from car to pedestrian or bike (derived from the Transport Modelling Tool) in order to calculate changes due to increased physical activity. Expenditures on medicine are appraised from the literature, taking the lower bound of about 5% due to lack of data for Austria (range between 5–35% depending on the disease, cf. e.g., Brown et al. [
