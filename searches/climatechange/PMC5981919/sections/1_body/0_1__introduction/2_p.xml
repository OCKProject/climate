<p class="p">Globally the transport sector accounts for 14% of the direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>equ in 2010) [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In Austria this sector is one of the largest emitters of GHG emissions (accounting for 29% of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>equ emissions in 2016) and the sector with the largest increase since 1990 (at 67%) [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (PM) impact health adversely, especially in urban areas with specific topographic and climatic constellations. Analyzing the conditions in Austria more closely, we find that in 2017 the number of days with PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> exceeding the threshold level of 50 Âµg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (daily average) were highest in Graz with 49 days, Linz with 25 and Vienna with 20 days [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Thus, for modelling health co-benefits of climate change strategies we focus on urban transport for these three largest Austrian cities. Furthermore, the mitigation potential of switching from motorized individual transport to public transport, bicycling or walking is large in urban areas due to available infrastructure and short distances between key locations of everyday life.
