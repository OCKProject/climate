<p class="p">Recent studies have investigated the impacts of specific climate change strategies in urban transport and model the corresponding health effects (for an overview see [

The health effects analyzed refer to changes in physical activity and air pollution; traffic injuries were less often evaluated. In this analysis, we evaluate co-benefits of increased physical activity and improved air quality by applying an interdisciplinary multi-model approach linking a transport modelling tool, a transport emission model, an emission dispersion model for air pollution impacts and a health model. We build on previous work [
