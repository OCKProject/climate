<p class="p">Xia et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] address a shortcoming of recent studies that economic valuation of benefits is still at an early stage, focusing only on a specific transport mode (e.g., HEAT Tool of the WHO for cycling [

 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] model the implementation of a road pricing tax in order to achieve specific emission reduction targets and technological mitigation in separate scenarios. To the authorsâ€™ best knowledge, a comprehensive and detailed macroeconomic assessment of climate change policies as it is presented here, has not been carried out until now. The role of public investments especially has thus far been neglected, but is included here.
