Three different scenarios are formulated and modelled for this purpose: the ‘Green Mobility’ scenario is based on the urban parliaments’ targets for modal share of trips, the ‘Green Exercise’ scenario simulates a change in mobility behavior beyond the politically-accepted urban targets for the modal share and the ‘Zero Emission’ scenario corresponds to the Green Exercise scenario with all motorized trips conducted with electric energy.</p>
