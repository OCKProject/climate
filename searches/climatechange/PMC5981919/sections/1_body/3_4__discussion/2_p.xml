<p class="p">By conducting the underlying study, we meet these challenges despite the expected obstacles and apply a multi-model approach that considers all modes of passenger transport (cycling, walking, public transport and car travel). We consider and model commuters transport (within the city borders). Our approach regards and valuates direct investment and operating costs of mitigation policies as well as monetarized benefits from reduced health costs for private households and the public sector. Furthermore, the approach incorporates a macroeconomic feedback analysis of indirect costs and benefits due to the interrelation of different sectors within the national economy.</p>
