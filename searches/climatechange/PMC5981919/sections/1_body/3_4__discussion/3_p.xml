With this study we take an alternative route to this challenge by starting from the passenger transport targets as agreed to by city parliaments and calculate the health co-benefits of these mitigation policies. Further, we put high emphasis in enhancing the measures especially in those areas where high health benefits are to be expected to provide environmental policy makers an additional health incentive for increasing their effort.
