<p class="p">Recent literature shows positive health co-benefits from improved air quality and physical activity due to climate mitigation strategies in passenger transport (cf. [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]). Most of the studies end with the valuation of changes in health parameters (deaths, incidence, hospital admissions etc.) and do not include an economic assessment of these benefits in monetary terms. Some consider specific aspects like changes in air quality or cycling only to be considered [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. There is only one study incorporating investment and operating costs of transportation policies, which are compared with benefits [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. A reason for the lack of economic valuation could be that valuation of co-benefits needs an interplay of different disciplines and model approaches, which is a challenging task. It calls for a mutual understanding of different disciplines and models and well-considered interfaces between the models and corresponding data. As an example, some models (in our case the emission dispersion model) take many weeks to generate spatially-explicit air pollution data. Thus, only few changes in input data can cause time-consuming and costly interdependent model runs. Furthermore, a wide set of data from different sources has to be collected and processed on different levels of detail.
