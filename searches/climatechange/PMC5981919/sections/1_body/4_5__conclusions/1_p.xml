<p class="p">Modelling co-benefits of mitigation policies in the transportation sector is a complex process requiring the interplay of different disciplines and sensible handling of data. The present study demonstrates that it is worth expanding the effort in quantifying such co-benefit effects of greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies. We do so for the three biggest Austrian urban areas. We directly transfer policy decisions (mitigation targets set by the local governments) into changes in physical activity and air quality and provide information on investment and operating costs but also on health co-benefits from reduced deaths and diseases covering reduced direct and indirect health costs) as well as on macroeconomic effects. As complex economic assessment tools had previously only been employed mainly for measures in the area of cycling (HEAT model [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], this study amends current literature by applying a multi-model comprehensive approach to calculate co-benefits from the perspectives of different economic actors, regarding all modes of passenger transport as well as domestic and commuter transport. Results show remarkable reductions of deaths in the cities, with stronger effects due to increased physical activity than to improvement of air quality. The benefits are highest for the Zero Emission Scenario and are especially due to reductions in NO

Benefits tend to be even higher when additional components would be included, such as changes in psychological effects from increased physical activity, green space or decreased noise exposure due to reduced motorized private transport. We also find that from a macroeconomic perspective, greenhouse gas mitigation policies in urban passenger transport clearly induce a strong positive welfare effect, when also accounting for co-benefits. These effects are remarkably higher when including the reduction of intangible costs, i.e., considering that transport policy due to its health effects is extending life expectancy which we also quantify in monetary terms by means of the value of life years (VOLY). We conclude that it is worthwhile to make the effort to assess co-benefits of climate mitigation policies in urban areas, because the numbers are significant and warrant consideration in decision making.
