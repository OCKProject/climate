<p class="p">Valuated in monetary terms, health benefits account for up to 11 million â‚¬ relative to the baseline per year. Additional costs for implementation and operation of public transport and bike or pedestrian facilities are mostly compensated by saved costs for motorized individual transport. For the Green Mobility and Green Exercise Scenario, costs are mainly borne by the public sector while benefits are generated by private households. For the Zero Emission scenario, additional costs for e-cars are borne by private households who are, however, compensated by benefits due to the switch from combustion to electric engines. If intangible costs (VSL) are included health co-benefits are substantially higher by a factor around 100.</p>
