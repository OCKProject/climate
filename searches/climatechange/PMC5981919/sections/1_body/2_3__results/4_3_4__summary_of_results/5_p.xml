<p class="p">Macroeconomic effects on gross domestic product (GDP) are weakly negative and strongly affected by a slightly lowered employment rate and by reduced health spending. However, for all scenarios, the increase in welfare is between +0.2% and +0.3%. The relatively strong positive welfare effect is mainly due to an increase in free disposable income, as private households can still meet their mobility needs with lower expenditures.</p>
