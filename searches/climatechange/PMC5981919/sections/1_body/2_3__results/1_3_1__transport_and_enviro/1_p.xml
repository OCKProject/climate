<p class="p">If measures are implemented leading to changes in the modal share of trips in line with targets by the local governments, substantial changes in vehicle mileage conducted by car can be expected. In the Green Exercise or Zero Emission scenario (which is equal with respect to changes in transport performance) this leads to a reduction in vehicle mileage of up to 55% relative to the baseline for Vienna (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00880-t005" class="xref">Table 5</xref> last column). Additionally bus kilometers relative to the baseline will increase up to 35%. For Graz this increase is highest as bus is the predominant transport mode at present, while in Vienna and Linz, electric transport modes are used that can be enhanced.
