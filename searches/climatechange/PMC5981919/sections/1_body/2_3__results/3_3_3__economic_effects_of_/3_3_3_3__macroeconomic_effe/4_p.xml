<p class="p">The overall positive welfare effect (+0.25%) is mainly driven by the decrease in necessary private expenditures, and only to a small extent by changes in public operating costs and morbidity. Shifts in public investment slightly diminish the overall welfare effect, however the total effect is clearly positive. When decomposing the GDP effect, we see that shifts in public operating costs and decreased morbidity enter positively into the GDP effect, while the changes in the composition of the public investment structure and private expenditure structure reduce this effect leading to an overall neutral effect on GDP. Regarding unemployment, we find that the changes in the structure of public and private expenditures and decreased morbidity lead to an increase in the unemployment rate while operating costs (e.g., staff for public transport) decreases unemployment.</p>
