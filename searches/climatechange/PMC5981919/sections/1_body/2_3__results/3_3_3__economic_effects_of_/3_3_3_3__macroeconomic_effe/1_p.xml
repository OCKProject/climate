<p class="p">The national macroeconomic impacts arise from changes in private and public expenditures for mobility (consumption and investment) and from changes in health expenditures funded by public authorities. Additionally, there are macroeconomic effects due to changes in work absence and morbidity leading to increases in productivity of the labor force. Changes in mortality have not been considered in the CGE model. Note that changes in private consumption are implemented by means of changes in the underlying utility function of the representative household. We thus assume that utility before and after the change in transport demand stays constant, but at different (lower) cost.</p>
