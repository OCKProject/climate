 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00880-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref> summarizes the macroeconomic effects. The most important finding is that for all scenarios there are welfare gains, ranging between +0.15% and +0.25%, with the strongest effect in the Green Exercise scenario. The relatively strong positive welfare effect is a result of changes in private consumption. Private households spend less on mobility, while their utility derived from mobility remains constant. On the macroeconomic level the welfare level thus increases. The effect on GDP, however, is slightly negative and correlates with the effects on the labor market. This is due to a shift of private and public expenditures from relatively labor-intensive goods and services (sale of cars, repair of conventional cars) to capital intensive goods (public transport infrastructure, rolling stock). The unemployment rate thus increases in all scenarios between 0.05% to 0.1% points, causing negative impacts on GDP. This effect is strongest in the ZE scenario, due to the relatively strong decrease in demand for retail and repair of cars with conventional drives as in this scenario all drives have been replaced by electric motors (cars and public transport). When additionally accounting for the intangible benefits as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00880-t009" class="xref">Table 9</xref>, the welfare effects are much stronger. Depending on the evaluation method (VOLY or VSL), the welfare effect is between +0.3% (GM, VOLY: 43,000 €) and +1.3% (ZE, VSL: 1.65 million €).
