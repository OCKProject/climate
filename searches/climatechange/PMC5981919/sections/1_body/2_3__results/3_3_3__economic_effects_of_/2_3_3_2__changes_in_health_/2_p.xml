<p class="p">The largest effects are observed in the ZE scenario (total: savings of 19 million € p.a.) with similar monetary effects from the two sources each, changes in air quality (9.8 million €) and changes in physical activity (9.2 million €). In addition, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00880-t009" class="xref">Table 9</xref> shows a range of intangible costs due to increased health and avoided deaths relative to the baseline. Depending on the VOLY unit saved costs account for 350 to 740 million € or 490 to 1026 million € (from GM to ZE scenario). Applying the VSL shows total values which are higher by the factor 2 to 3. Note, that even the most conservative of these valuations for both the GE and ZE scenarios indicate intangible benefits arising from these policies in just these three cities that are equivalent to 0.25% of overall Austrian GDP.
