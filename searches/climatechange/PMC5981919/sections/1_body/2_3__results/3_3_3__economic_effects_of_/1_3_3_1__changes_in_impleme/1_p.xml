 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00880-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows changes in expenditures for private households due to the shifts from car trips to cycling and walking trips as well as trips conducted by public transport. The savings primarily include operating costs of conventional cars. Considering the total timespan up to 2025, a gradual reduction of new car purchases is considered, leading to additional savings of fixed cost components. Private investment costs are higher for the ZE scenario compared to the other scenarios, as all conventional drives have been shifted to electric vehicles in this scenario and the purchase price for electric vehicles is much higher. Still, there is a net saving for the households in the ZE scenario since private operating costs are reduced to a higher degree.
