 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00880-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> contrasts the additional costs with the savings for the different scenarios and cities due to implemented climate change mitigation measures. For the GM and GE scenario savings for private households exceed expenditures from households and the public sector for Graz and Linz. For Vienna costs are slightly higher than savings due to the very ambitious modal share targets and required extension of public transport, bike and pedestrian infrastructure. For the ZE scenario, expenditures slightly exceed savings in all three cities due to additional costs for switching from conventional drives to electric vehicles. Future cost degradation was not included in the calculation which could change the results.
