<p class="p">A reduction of NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can save 138 to 665 lives (deaths due to cardio-vascular disease and respiratory disease). The effect of PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> reduction can prevent 27 to 60 myocardial infarction (MI) incidence cases and would reduce the YLD by about 0.4 to 0.9 years. Furthermore, the number of avoided lung cancer cases by PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> reductions ranges between 23 avoided cases for the GM scenario and 30 for the ZE scenario and would reduce the YLD by about 2.2 to 3.1 years.
