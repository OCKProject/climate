<p class="p">Very recent research using ice core data from a high snow accumulation rate site in Antarctica suggests that that the temperature signal associated with DO events originated in the NH and was then transmitted to the SH ~200 years later by oceanic processes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. Interestingly, the authors of the study highlight the fact that the North Atlantic processes thought to have initiated DO events could themselves have resulted from a remote and ‘elusive’ trigger. We propose that this trigger was a SH eruption, which initially cooled the SH for just 1–5 years due to increased atmospheric aerosol loading. Existing proxy records are too low resolution to detect this initial aerosol-induced cooling, but the cooling was sufficient to shift atmospheric circulation to the north, warming NH high latitudes, promoting NH ice sheet decay, strengthening AMOC, and initiating a positive feedback mechanism. This NH warming could then have been propagated back to the SH ~200 years later, well after the initial volcanic aerosol-induced cooling effects had abated. NH warming (triggered by a SH eruption) would have resulted in ice shelf collapse, increased freshwater outputs to the North Atlantic, or reduced sea ice extent, all previously suggested mechanisms driving DO events
