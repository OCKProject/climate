<p class="p">Despite the apparent undercount and chronological uncertainties, over the interval from 30 to 80 ka BP all five radiometrically-dated large (M ≥ 6; Pinatubo-sized or larger) SH volcanic eruptions are within chronological uncertainty of the initiation of a discrete DO event. Too few radiometrically-dated SH eruptions exist to confidently assess the link with DO events, but previous research linked direct evidence of SH eruptions derived from optical dust logger data from Antarctic Siple Dome ice with DO events over the period 27 to 70 ka
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. The link between SH volcanism and DO events was significant at the 99% confidence level, although a well-defined mechanistic link was absent. We propose that this ‘missing link’ is the now apparent hemispheric temperature asymmetry induced by stratospheric volcanic aerosols, followed by an ice/albedo and ocean circulation feedback. Future research should test the hypothesis further by improve the dating of both climate and volcanological records, and by using isotope-enabled GCM modelling.
