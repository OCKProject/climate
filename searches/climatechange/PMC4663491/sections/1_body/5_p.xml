<p class="p">We focus on the interval from 30 to 80 ka BP because of the high density of millennial-scale climate oscillations within that interval, and because the proposed mechanism would be most effective during intervals of time characterised by intermediate ice volume and 65°N insolation, such as most of this interval (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Unfortunately, the volcanological catalogue of known eruptions prior to 10 ka BP is very incomplete because: (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) erosion removes volcanic deposits from the geologic record and increases uncertainty associated with the estimation of eruption magnitude, (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) burial by younger deposits hides older deposits from study, and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) many volcanoes still remain understudied or even unknown. Even over only the last one thousand years, instances exist where evidence of large eruptions is apparent in ice core volcanogenic sulphate records but the volcano responsible has only recently been identified (e.g., Rinjani, 1257 A.D.) or is still unknown (e.g., the 1809 A.D. eruption). Prior to the Holocene, large eruptions from SH calderas are particularly underrepresented (see
