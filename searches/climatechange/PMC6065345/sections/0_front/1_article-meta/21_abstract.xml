 <p class="p">Accelerated climate change represents a major threat to the health of the planet's biodiversity. Particularly, lizards of the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> might be negatively affected by this phenomenon because several of its species have restricted distributions, low vagility, and preference for low temperatures. No study, however, has examined the climatic niche of the species of this genus and how their distribution might be influenced by different climate change scenarios. In this project, we used a maximum entropy approach to model the climatic niche of 10 species of the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> under present and future suitable habitat, considering a climatic niche conservatism context. Therefore, we performed a similarity analysis of the climatic niche between each species of the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic>. Our results suggest that a substantial decrease in suitable habitat for all species will occur by 2070. Among the most affected species, 
  <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">tzacualtipantecus</italic> will not have suitable conditions according to its climatic niche requirements and 
  <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">phalaroanthereon</italic> will lose 85.75% of its current suitable area. On the other hand, we found low values of conservatism of the climatic niche among species. Given the limited capacity of dispersion and the habitat specificity of these lizards, it seems unlikely that fast changes would occur in the distribution of these species facing climate change. The low conservatism in climatic niche we found in 
  <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> suggests that these species might have the capacity to adapt to the new environmental conditions originated by climate change.
