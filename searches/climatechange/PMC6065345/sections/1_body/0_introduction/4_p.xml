<p class="p">Range‐restricted species often are particularly vulnerable to extinction due to the climate change that is happening presently; therefore, endemic species could be strongly affected (Ballesteros‐Barrera, Martínez‐Meyer, &amp; Gadsden, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Malcolm, Liu, Neilson, Hansen, &amp; Hannah, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). This condition could be even more problematic if these species tend to conserve their climatic niche (Wiens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Many studies have used species distribution modeling to predict habitat suitability of endemic species in the future (García, Ortega‐Huerta, &amp; Martínez‐Meyer, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Thuiller et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, evaluating whether these studied species conserve their niche has not been performed commonly. Therefore, besides evaluating the availability of areas with suitable climatic conditions for species in the future, it is also important to evaluate whether species show a tendency to conserve their climatic niche, which would help provide more information to better understand their capacity of response to climate change; these data could be obtained from reptiles, because as ectothermic organisms, they are good models to use to assess the impacts of climate change (Huey &amp; Kingsolver, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>; Valenzuela‐Ceballos, Castañeda‐Gaytán, Rioja‐Paradela, Carrillo‐Reyes, &amp; Bastiaans,
