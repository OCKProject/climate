<p class="p">In this project, we evaluated: (a) the extent of areas with suitable climatic conditions for the occurrence of the 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> species in the near future (2070), considering that these lizards conserve their climatic niche; and (b) whether the various species of 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> have different climatic niches, which could be evidence of lack of niche conservatism, favoring taxa with reduced areas with suitable living conditions in the future.
