<p class="p">The climatic niche of a species is the set of climatic variables delimiting the necessary conditions for it to reproduce and survive (Bonetti &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which is determined by adaptation to its environment (Zúñiga‐Vega et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and the legacy of ancestry (Ackerly &amp; Reich, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Considering this, studying the specialization to a limited set of climatic conditions of a species could be important for understanding its response to climate change (Deutsch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The changes in climate originated by anthropogenic activities can have serious potential consequences for most species (Albon et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), particularly those that strictly depend on specific conditions of habitat (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>).
