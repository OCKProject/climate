<p class="p">In conclusion, we found that 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> species will face strong reductions in their suitable climatic area due to climate change and that the low values obtained from the indices of climatic similarity among the 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> species suggest that they could respond to local environmental changes. The persistence of the species of Xenosaurus, depends on several factors, such as speed of climate change, accessibility of areas to migrate, vegetation structure, dispersion rate, thermal tolerances, and the change in dimensions of the biotic niche (e.g., new predators and competitors; Loarie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Then, even our optimistic finding of niche shift might not be enough for these species to prevail. For example, species of 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> need micro‐environmental conditions for survival and reproduction (Ballinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Lemos‐Espinal &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Therefore, our models could have biases in their accuracy, because these models only consider environmental variables at macro‐scale levels and do not take into account micro‐environmental conditions and interactions (Mateo, Felicísimo, &amp; Muñoz, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Therefore, we propose to do more fine‐scale studies of ethology and thermal ecology (López‐Alcaide, Nakamura, Macip‐Ríos, &amp; Martínez‐Meyer, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) in order to establish greater precision in our understanding of the response of these species to increase in the ambient temperature.
