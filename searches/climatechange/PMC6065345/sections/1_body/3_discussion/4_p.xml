<p class="p">According to the variables that contributed the most to the climatic niche models (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece34200-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), it is evident that precipitation regime is very important for 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> lizards; also, our results indicate that a decline in precipitation conditions for this species in the area they inhabit is expected under all scenarios, causing more hostile environments for the lizards. For example, Lavergne, Mouquet, Thuiller, and Ronce (
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) noted that organisms might not be able to adapt to climate change if the rate of change is too rapid and the demography is not sufficiently dynamic. Therefore, one of the crucial questions in the debate on ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt rapidly enough to keep up with the rapid pace of changing climate (Parmesan,
