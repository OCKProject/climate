<p class="p">Even the lack of niche conservatism, might not be enough for 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> to successfully adapt in the future. For example, there is evidence that most of the species of 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> need a dense vegetation cover to survive and reproduce. Authors such as Nieto‐Montes de Oca (

 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and Lara‐Tufiño, Ramírez‐Bautista, Hernández‐Austria, Wilson, and Berriozabal‐Islas (
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) pointed out that native vegetation cover provides suitable conditions of humidity and temperature for thermoregulation; therefore, these factors are necessary for the persistence of the species. Thus, if vegetation is disturbed by anthropogenic activities or by climate change, 
 <italic class="italic">Xenosaurus</italic> species might lose most of their needed micro‐climatic conditions.
