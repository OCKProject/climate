<p class="p">Successful calibration is important for datasets that suffer from sampling bias and for studies that require transfer models through space or time, for example, climate change response (Elith, Kearney, &amp; Phillips,

 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, for the construction of the models, the dataset used in MaxEnt was randomly divided as follows: 75% of the data was used for the model construction or calibration, and the remaining 25% was used to evaluate the adjustment of the model (Cianfrani, Lay, Hirzel, &amp; Loy,
