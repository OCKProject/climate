<p class="p">Comparison of climatic niche among the 10 species of the genus was carried out using the analytical framework developed by Broennimann et al. (

 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) for R version 3.3.2 R Core Team, including the environmental variables retained in the analyses of bivariate correlation. We used the Principal Component Analysis Approach (PCA‐environmental), where we extracted the first two axes of a PCA including the seven bioclimatic variables selected in our study to represent the climatic niche. Environmental space was divided in a grid of 100 × 100 cells, and each cell represented a single vector of the environmental conditions that occur in one or more sites in the geographic space (Broennimann et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A Kernel density function was employed to calculate the density of occurrence of each species and number of sites, with particular environmental conditions for each cell of the environmental space.
