<p class="p">Subsequently, to identify the variables with the greatest contribution in explaining the spatial‐environmental variation for each species, an analysis of bivariate correlation of Pearson was performed among all the environmental variables pairs to check for collinearity among the input variables in the program STATISTICA ver 10 (StatSoft Inc, 2004; Merow, Smith, &amp; Silander,

Seven climatic variables were selected when performing this procedure: Bio1 (annual mean temperature), bio7 (annual range temperature), bio11 (annual mean temperature of the coldest quarter), bio12 (annual precipitation), bio 14 (precipitation of the driest month), bio17 (precipitation of the driest quarter), and bio18 (precipitation of the warmest quarter).
