<p class="p">Climatic information was obtained from the 19 current climatic layers available in WorldClim (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece34200-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). These were used to describe the climatic niche of each

These climatic layers contain annual means of the meteorological conditions recorded from the period 1950–2000 with a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc‐minutes. We trimmed the spatial extent of the variables in ArcGIS to include the area from Mexico and Guatemala and included the resolution of our data in one km
