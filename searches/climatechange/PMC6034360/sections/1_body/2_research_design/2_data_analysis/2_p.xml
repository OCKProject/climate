<p class="p">In Step 2, we assessed the implementation level of each corporate activity. For this purpose, we developed a rating scheme that comprised the same categories as the content analysis. The underlying question for the rating scale was ‘What is the implementation level of the respective corporate activity?’. A five‐point Likert scale served to assign ‘scores’ to each company for each category. The scale ranged from 0 (very low implementation level) to 4 (very high implementation level). To accurately capture the extent to which activities can be theoretically implemented, we iteratively adapted the rating scheme to the context of each corporate activity. This was done through a preliminary screening of the coded documents and by comparing the rating scheme with similar ones used in previous studies (e.g. Kolk and Pinkse,

 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>; Weinhofer and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The final rating schemes can be found in the appendix. Finally, two researchers independently assessed the implementation level of activities. Inter‐rater reliability amounted to 87.9% (percentage of agreement) and 0.72 (Krippendorff's alpha), which is acceptable (Krippendorff, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For distinct ratings, we made a consensus‐based decision on the respective final score to be used. We then assigned a score to the four strategic objectives (governance, innovation, compensation and legitimation) by computing the mean rating of the associated corporate activities.
