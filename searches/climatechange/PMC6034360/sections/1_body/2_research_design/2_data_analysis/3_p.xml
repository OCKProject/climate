<p class="p">To identify different types of strategy, the third step comprised a two‐step cluster analysis conducted in SPSS. Using the scores of the four strategic intents as input variables, we conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the optimal number of clusters. We chose the Ward method and squared Euclidean distance as the distance measure. After this, we plotted the proximity measures of each stage of the clustering procedure in a scree plot and applied the elbow criterion. It turned out that four clusters were the optimal solution. Subsequently, a non‐hierarchical cluster analysis (
