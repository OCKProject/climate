<p class="p">In the last step, we performed a Mann–Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> test and an ANOVA to statistically analyze the differences between OEMs and suppliers on the one hand and the different strategy clusters on the other hand. We applied the non‐parametric Mann–Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> test to compare the implementation levels of corporate activities, because a Shapiro–Wilk test showed a non‐normal distribution of the data. Due to multiple comparisons between OEMs and suppliers we adjusted the significance level through a Šidák correction to avoid making a ‘Type 1’ error, i.e. rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Abdi,

Firm size was measured by the natural logarithm of annual sales while financial performance was measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). This is in line with similar studies (e.g. Sprengel and Busch,
