<p class="p">There are five avenues that are particularly promising for future research. First, we could not fully explain the strategic responses to climate change of European and North American businesses. A more detailed analysis of institutional characteristics could shed light on the effectiveness of specific policies in triggering corporate action. Second, there remains a need for investigations of strategy dynamics within an industry, as the results of the present study might not be applicable to other business sectors. While the nature of an intra‐sector study reduces the generalizability of findings, it helps to isolate the effects of sector‐specific regulatory and stakeholder pressures. Third, case studies of highly globalized companies could generate more insights into the mechanism of action of the home‐country and host‐country effects. Studying companies that operate in a variety of markets could help to disentangle whether the level of influence of the home country's policy regime is connected to the degree of a company's internationalization. Fourth, the literature still lacks longitudinal studies of corporate climate action, its determinants and effectiveness in generating long‐term outcomes. Last, little research has addressed business responses to climate adaptation issues. As the impacts of climate change are likely to be felt soon, understanding the drivers and types of corporate adaptation strategies is of vital importance for policy‐makers to design appropriate regulation.</p>
