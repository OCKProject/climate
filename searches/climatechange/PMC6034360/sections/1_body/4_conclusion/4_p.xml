<p class="p">Our study has important implications for businesses and policy‐makers. First, the findings support other researchers' call for a more thorough integration of suppliers in emission reduction efforts (Böttcher and Müller, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Due to a lower level of stakeholder pressure further upstream in the supply chain, focal companies should make use of their buyer power to stimulate more ambitious action on climate change on the part of their suppliers. Economic rationales might be another reason for suppliers' resistance to be more proactive. However, other researchers have shown that the ambitiousness of strategies can be associated with financial benefits (e.g. Boiral

 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and our analysis at least does not hint at a negative relationship between financial performance and climate action. Second, since suppliers are generally smaller in size and possess less organizational resources compared with OEMs, policies that incentivize corporate contributions to climate change mitigation, such as subsidies or tax incentives for renewable energy use, should especially target smaller firms.
