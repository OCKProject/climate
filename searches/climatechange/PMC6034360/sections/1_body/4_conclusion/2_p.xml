<p class="p">The comparison of climate change strategy types with regard to different institutional environments yielded ambiguous results. European and North American businesses tend to be most proactive. However, there seems to be no dominant type of strategy pursued, because companies from both regions are relatively evenly distributed across the strategy clusters. Companies from Japan and South Korea, although exposed to more stringent climate policy regimes than their North American counterparts, exhibit a lower level of strategy implementation. Nevertheless, their strategic priorities are more distinct, expressed in a preference for technological solutions to emission reductions over legitimizing or compensating them. Climate actions of companies from the above‚Äêmentioned regions are thus likely determined by factors other than their home country's institutional environment. In contrast to this, companies from countries with the least ambitious climate regulations also tend to be in the least active strategy clusters, which would in turn emphasize the importance of regulatory pressure for proactive climate action.</p>
