<p class="p">This study illustrates how the institutional environment of a company's home country and its position in the supply chain affect action on climate change. The empirical analysis shows that international automotive companies are generally very active in implementing climate change measures. However, strategies of OEMs and suppliers differ significantly from each other. Apart from technological solutions to emission reductions, OEMs are more ambitious in almost every aspect, confirming that closeness‐to‐consumer and associated stakeholder pressure can play a crucial role in shaping business responses to climate change (Sprengel and Busch, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). This is supported by a cluster analysis. While strategies in the automotive industry exhibit similar patterns in terms of the prioritization of objectives, they can be mapped on a continuum from less to more active. Automobile manufacturers mainly belong to clusters with a high overall level of climate change action, whereas suppliers are mostly located at the other end of the spectrum. Moreover, OEMs focus much more on carbon compensation measures and engagement with stakeholders and policy‐makers to legitimate their business operations.
