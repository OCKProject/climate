<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="bse1968-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the characteristics of the analyzed firms. On average, automobile manufacturers are larger than suppliers in terms of both annual sales and workforce. Profitability is relatively high and little variation exists in this regard. When looking at the level of corporate action (Table 
 <xref rid="bse1968-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), it becomes apparent that automotive companies are generally highly active in implementing measures in response to climate change. Most of the companies have realized the risks and opportunities related to climate change, set up GHG inventories, adopted emission reduction targets and show a high degree of organizational involvement. Moreover, the majority of businesses in the sector have introduced ambitious product and process innovations that already led to emission reductions and explore new markets in which low‐carbon aspects are a unique selling point.
