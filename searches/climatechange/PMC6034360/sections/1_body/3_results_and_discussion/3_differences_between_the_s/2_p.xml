<p class="p">In line with the descriptive statistics (see Table 
 <xref rid="bse1968-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), it can be concluded that OEMs are generally more proactive than suppliers (Table 
 <xref rid="bse1968-tbl-0006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). 73.3% of the former belong to the two most active clusters, while the latter are mostly in the two clusters that have the least ambitious strategies (67.9%). More than half of the OEMs pursue an ‘all‐round enhancer’ type of strategy, whereas companies further up the supply chain are predominantly ‘emergent innovators’. An explanation could be that being closer to the end consumer translates into more sophisticated action due to greater visibility and exposure to public scrutiny (Bansal and Roth, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Haddock‐Fraser and Tourelle, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Due to their focus on business‐to‐business activities, suppliers are likely to be the least visible actors in the automotive industry. Consequently, the degree of stakeholder pressure is much lower and so is the need for ambitious action on climate change.
