<p class="p">The cluster analysis yielded four distinct groups of corporate strategies. The pseudo‐
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> value calculated during the 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>‐means clustering procedure confirmed that the four clusters are a meaningful classification of the data set. Table 
 <xref rid="bse1968-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> provides a summary of the cluster centers, i.e. the mean score of respective strategic actions, and the number of companies in each cluster. It is noteworthy that companies are almost evenly distributed across the clusters. Firms also exhibit similar strategy patterns, i.e. innovation is of highest and compensation of lowest priority, and there is a hierarchy of clusters in terms of proactivity, illustrated by the average strategy score of the clusters. Hence, there is a continuum ranging from strategies that are still in the planning phase (‘introverted laggard’) to those that are very ambitious (‘all‐round enhancer’). This supports other studies on environmental strategies and corporate responses to climate change that outlined an evolution of corporate action on a continuum (e.g. Kolk and Mauser,
