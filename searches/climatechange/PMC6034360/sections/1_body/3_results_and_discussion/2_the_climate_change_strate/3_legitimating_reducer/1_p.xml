<p class="p">This strategy cluster consists of companies that are very active both in building up governance capabilities for climate change issues and in innovating for carbon emission reductions. They also actively engage with their stakeholders and regulatory bodies in order to gain legitimacy for their actions. At the same time, however, initiatives related to emission credit acquisition and reducing suppliers' emissions are still in the planning phase. Respective companies thus mainly focus on emission reduction activities and on legitimizing their business operations rather than on compensating their emissions externally. Legitimating reducers represent approximately one‐fourth of the automotive companies analyzed and are similar to the strategy types ‘substituting reducer’ (Weinhofer and Hoffmann,
