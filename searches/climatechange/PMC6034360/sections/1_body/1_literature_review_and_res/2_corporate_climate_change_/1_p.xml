<p class="p">In the literature, various terms have been used for companies' responses to climate change. When looking at the different approaches, it becomes apparent that many scholars exclusively focus on the management of corporate CO

Although corporate carbon emissions do indeed play a central role in the debate about climate change mitigation, solely concentrating on emission reduction neglects other important facets of business strategies, such as political lobbying, stakeholder management and corporate citizenship. In order to draw a more complete picture, we therefore consider both market and non‐market aspects of strategies in our study. By building on notions from Okereke and Russel (

The scope of our research is hence limited to climate change mitigation. Corporate adaptation to the impacts of climate change is not considered.
