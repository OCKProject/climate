<p class="p">In the literature on sustainable supply chain management, a popular topic is the relationship between internal and external factors and the adoption of environmental practices among suppliers (Zhu

 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007b</xref>, p. 374), ‘the position of the company in the supply chain determines to which extent a company depends on its customers and thus follows a concomitant climate strategy’. While suppliers predominantly conduct business‐to‐business activities, OEMs are closer to the end consumer and therefore susceptible to a higher degree of stakeholder pressure (Bansal and Roth,
