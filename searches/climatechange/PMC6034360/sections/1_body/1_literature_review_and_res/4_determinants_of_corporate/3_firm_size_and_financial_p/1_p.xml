<p class="p">Both the size of a company and its access to financial resources have often been adduced to explain variation in climate change strategies (Engau and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Weinhofer and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lee, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). The larger and economically more successful a firm is, the more sophisticated its strategy tends to be. Size and financial resources seem to go hand in hand, as larger firms usually have easier access to financial capital and possess more human resources for implementation purposes. Moreover, larger companies are also exposed to increased stakeholder scrutiny due to their higher visibility and media attraction (Bansal, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We therefore expect firms that are comparatively large and perform better in financial terms to show a higher implementation level of activities in response to climate change.
