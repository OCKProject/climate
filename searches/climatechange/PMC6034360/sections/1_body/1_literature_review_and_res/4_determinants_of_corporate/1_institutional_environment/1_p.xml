<p class="p">Institutional theory suggests that firms' action is shaped by three main kinds of institutional pressure: (1) normative, i.e. social and cultural norms to which companies are expected to adhere; (2) coercive, i.e. regulations and laws; (3) mimetic, i.e. the imitation of competitors' behavior to avoid uncertainty (DiMaggio and Powell, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). It also implies that in a particular organizational field strategic approaches will resemble each other in the long run due to similar institutional pressures, which is called institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). Most research in the context of climate change provides evidence for the influence of different institutional environments on corporate responses (e.g. Cadez and Czerny, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tang and Luo, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Most of these studies draw conclusions based on cross‐sector analyses. So far, few studies have focused on intra‐sectoral strategy dynamics. Levy and Kolk (
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) and Weinhofer and Hoffmann (
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) show that, in the case of multinational oil and electric utility companies, the institutional framework of a company's home country does indeed have an influence on corporate strategies. On the other hand, a case study of car manufacturers from different countries by Busch and Schwarzkopf (
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) finds little variation in strategies among the examined companies. This would support the idea of institutional isomorphism. It also questions the importance of the so‐called ‘home‐country effect’ (Levy and Kolk, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). If highly globalized companies with different regional affiliations exhibit similar strategy patterns, the institutional environments of a company's dominant sales markets might be more influential than home‐country factors, which is called the ‘host‐country effect’ (Amran 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). While the goal of this paper is not to test hypotheses on the relationship between institutional factors and strategies, we want to shed more light on how the regional context of a company's business affects the type of strategy employed.
