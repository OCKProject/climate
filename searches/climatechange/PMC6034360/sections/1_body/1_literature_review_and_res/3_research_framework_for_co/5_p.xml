<p class="p">The strategy framework proposed in the present study (Figure 
 <xref rid="bse1968-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) can be considered to integrate both continuum‐ and typology‐based viewpoints and is hence similar to previous classifications in the research field (see, e.g., Kolk and Pinkse, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Weinhofer and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lee, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). The framework employs a (static) typology perspective because it assumes that companies' strategies can exhibit different patterns. On the one hand, companies may implement none or any possible combination of the above‐mentioned climate change activities. On the other hand, firms may also differ in their prioritization of strategic intents, e.g. one company focuses on legitimizing its carbon footprint while another primarily aims at reducing GHG emissions. The proposed climate change strategy framework furthermore exhibits continuum characteristics because it assumes that firms differ with regard to the implementation level of activities. It therefore captures the dynamic aspects of corporate strategies by accounting for a possible evolution of climate change responses over time.
