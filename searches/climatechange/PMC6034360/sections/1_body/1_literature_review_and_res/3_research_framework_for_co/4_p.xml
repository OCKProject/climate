<p class="p">The literature suggests that conceptualizations of climate change strategies can employ either a continuum‐ or a typology‐based perspective (Kolk and Mauser, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Lee, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). Continuum approaches view strategies as an evolutionary process, in which a firm incrementally transitions from a resistant to a proactive attitude towards climate change mitigation. Therefore, a continuum perspective stipulates that there is an ideal strategy, namely the most proactive one. Typology‐based approaches on the other hand do not emphasize a hierarchy or the temporal development of strategies but rather on different types of coexisting strategic approach. This notion implies that there is no one strategic optimum but rather a multitude of distinct strategies to reach the same goal.
