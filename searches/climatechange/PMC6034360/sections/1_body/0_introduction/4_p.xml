<p class="p">Motivated by these research gaps, the research objective of the present paper is to develop a better understanding of the characteristics and determinants of corporate climate change strategies in the automotive industry, whilst taking into account supply chain and institutional aspects. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we develop a generic framework for studying corporate responses to climate change from a holistic perspective by including both market and non‚Äêmarket responses. Second, we provide empirical evidence for the influence of companies' home countries' institutional environment on climate change strategies. Third, our study contributes to the limited knowledge about differences in corporate action on climate change between companies in the same supply chain.</p>
