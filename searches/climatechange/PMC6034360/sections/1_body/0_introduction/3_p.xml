<p class="p">In management science, the analysis of corporate action on climate change is a comparatively recent development. Although numerous scholars have examined companies' general approaches to sustainability and environmental protection, few studies opted to specifically analyze the characteristics of climate change strategies (e.g. Kolk and Pinkse, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Weinhofer and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lee, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>) and their determinants (e.g. Okereke, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Boiral 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Böttcher and Müller, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Moreover, previous research exhibits three main limitations. First, categorizations of strategies primarily rely on cross‐sector analyses (e.g. Jeswani 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Sprengel and Busch, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Backman 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Little research has studied the variation of strategies within sectors (Weinhofer and Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Such an investigation can yield valuable knowledge about intra‐industrial dynamics and can control for external influences that are otherwise difficult to grasp due to sector‐specific institutional environments. Intra‐sectoral analyses are especially suited to better understand the importance of the so‐called ‘home‐country effect’ on strategies (Levy and Kolk, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), suggesting that corporate action is shaped by the institutional setting of a company's main location. Second, the supply chain context of corporate climate action has largely been neglected so far (Jira and Toffel, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). To our knowledge, there is no research that looks at differences in strategies between companies in the same supply chain. Since the success of focal companies' responses to climate change is often closely related to the performance of their suppliers, analyzing the variation in strategies can yield valuable insights into the role of the supply chain position for action on climate change (Lee, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Third, studies on the automotive industry in particular are rare, and focus on companies from a single country or case studies of only a few companies (e.g. Böttcher and Müller, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Busch and Schwarzkopf, 
 <xref rid="bse1968-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Moreover, a comparison between strategies of suppliers with those of OEMs has not been made so far. Consequently, there is a lack of an ample sector analysis that considers strategic responses of both OEMs and suppliers in different institutional environments.
