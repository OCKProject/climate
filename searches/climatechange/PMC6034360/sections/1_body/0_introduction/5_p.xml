<p class="p">The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we conduct a review of the literature on business responses to climate change and develop a research framework. We argue that climate change strategies consist of a set of different activities with four major strategic objectives: governance, innovation, compensation and legitimation. With the help of a content and a subsequent cluster analysis, we apply our framework to the global automotive industry. Based on a sample of 116 companies, we identify different types of strategy and investigate the influence of supply chain position, regional affiliation, firm size and financial performance.</p>
