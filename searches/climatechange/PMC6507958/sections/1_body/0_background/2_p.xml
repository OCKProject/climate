 <xref rid="CIT0010" class="xref">10</xref>]. Faced with limited resources, population dynamics and in most cases a remoteness that offers its own challenges of limited connectivity to the rest of the world, their fragile socioecological context is further threatened by climate change. PIC climate vulnerability involves inherent risks, such as being low-lying, small landmass, and in the pathway of intense storms. Numerous publications and reports have outlined the situation of many small island developing states (SIDS) in the region which have been described as ‘canaries in the coal mine’ of climate change [
