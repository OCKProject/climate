<p class="p">Kiribati, the country with the lowest GDP per capita in the Pacific [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" class="xref">15</xref>], can be described as a textbook case of inherent climate vulnerability with limited land area, overcrowding, low elevation of islands and water insecurity exacerbating public health problems [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" class="xref">16</xref>]. In recent years, Kiribati has often made it to news headlines in relation to its vulnerability to climate change, with a narrative of islands being submerged this century due to sea level rise [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" class="xref">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0020" class="xref">20</xref>]. This has led the Government of Kiribati to purchase land in Fiji in order to ensure food security and a place for migration in the eventuality of sea level rise rendering their islands uninhabitable – a controversial decision not without its critics [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0022" class="xref">22</xref>]. In this context of an existential threat, how can a country affected by so many challenges adapt to the ‘multiplier effects’ of climate change?
