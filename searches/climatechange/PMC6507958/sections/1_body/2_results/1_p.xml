<p class="p">A total of 157 items were identified through the search strategy, which included peer reviewed articles from databases (n = 59) and other sources, mostly non-peer-reviewed literature (n = 98) via the Google search. Following the removal of duplicates, 117 unique items had their titles and abstracts screened for relevance, empirical evidence and mention of Kiribati. Exclusion here was defined by having a blog, for example, that focused on rural Kenya, or a blog post from a company that discussed food security purely from a commodity price perspective with barely any mention of climate change or health. Thirty-eight items were subsequently excluded.</p>
