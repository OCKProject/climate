<p class="p">A systematic search was carried out on 14 August 2018 on three databases: PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCOhost. Google search was used for alternative sources on the same day. The Google search for non-peer-reviewed literature was opted for in light of the few items of peer-reviewed literature found in the databases above.</p>
