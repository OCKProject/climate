<p class="p">Kiribati is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in terms of food security and health. This is especially the case due to its inherent problems in terms of geography, population pressures and limited infrastructure. As climate change impacts increase, so will the problems in food security and health unless effective adaptation programmes are implemented. To date, interventions seem to have had little success.</p>
