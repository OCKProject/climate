<p class="p">This review concludes that rigorous evidence is scarce where Kiribati is concerned, especially regarding climate change, food security and health interactions. Numerous reports exist discussing the problem, but few outline successful interventions that can be replicated in Kiribati and elsewhere. Community perceptions of climate change and intervention projects in particular are needed so as to ensure effective and sustainable projects of this nature, especially in lieu of lessons learnt from the KAP. Given both the urgency of this subject and the vulnerability of Kiribati in particular, addressing this lack of information would be timely. This is especially the case as continued global greenhouse gas emissions mean some degree of climate adaptation is necessary in the coming decades. Additionally, greater cooperation between government agencies in Kiribati on climate risk is highly recommended, given the complexity in tackling problems in this area that often requires a multi-pronged approach. This could be achieved through the creation of an inter-agency initiative, for example, which could coordinate complex interventions requiring various sources of input.</p>
