<p class="p">While the problems with food security and health in Kiribati and the probable impacts of climate change on this interaction are described, there is very little research on how households and communities make their food choices. Is it purely due to cultural reasons? Is it a matter of economic convenience? Is it perhaps that they would rather subsist on traditional food but have neither the time nor lifestyle to permit such a way of life in the 21st century? These questions remain mostly unanswered and are an opportunity for future research in this area which would help inform communities and policymakers on what could be an effective intervention while learning the lessons from KAP which faced numerous problems in this area.</p>
