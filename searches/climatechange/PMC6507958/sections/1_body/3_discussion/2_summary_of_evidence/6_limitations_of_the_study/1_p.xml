<p class="p">This review has important limitations. First, the search process limited items to those in English-language databases. Secondly, while search strategies, exclusion criteria and analytical methods were discussed among co-authors in relation to the decision-making process, the items were selected by the first author. This could have introduced potential bias. Thirdly, reports on the subject are extensive, but it was limited to a 10-year period from 2008 to the present day for pragmatic reasons.</p>
