<p class="p">Both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature includes at least a mention of Kiribati within the context of the Pacific region, which is characterised by various remote, isolated countries with significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, population pressures and (with the notable exception of Papua New Guinea) limited land. McIver et al. compare different countries in the region in terms of the highest priority climate-sensitive health risks in individual Pacific island countries (see 
 <xref rid="T0003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Kiribati here is clearly not on its own regarding water, and food security issues, with a table showing that climate-sensitive health risks are found in all countries in the region. While it is exempt from extreme weather events such as cyclones on account of its geographical position, it is at risk of other events such as ‘king tides’ which are striking with increasing frequency [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" class="xref">56</xref>]. Note also how ‘population pressures’ are significant enough in Kiribati to warrant their own entry, with health systems problems also listed as a mention (together with Fiji).
