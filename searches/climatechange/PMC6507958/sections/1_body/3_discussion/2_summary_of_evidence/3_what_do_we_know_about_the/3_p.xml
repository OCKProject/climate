<p class="p">Kiribati has been described as a ‘canary in the coal mine’ for climate change effects [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" class="xref">23</xref>]. Rising sea levels, salinisation of aquifers, coastal erosion, changing biodiversity, increasingly frequent ‘king tides’ and drought are repeatedly acknowledged as being on the increase, severely impacting both the socioeconomic and ecological environment of Kiribati [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0031" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0040" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0042" class="xref">42</xref>]. Various interventions have been attempted over the years in order to increase the resilience of the people of Kiribati to these impacts, often with limited success [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0055" class="xref">55</xref>]. Multiple reports also reveal how traditional knowledge is key to promoting nutritional diversity as well as biodiversity, in terms of both agriculture [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0036" class="xref">36</xref>] and fishing [
