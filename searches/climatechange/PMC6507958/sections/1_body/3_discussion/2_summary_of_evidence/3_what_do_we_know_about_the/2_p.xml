<p class="p">Although McIver et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" class="xref">9</xref>] did not identify NCDs as a high priority climate-sensitive health risk in Kiribati (see 
 <xref rid="T0003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), data from the Global Burden of Disease study [
 <xref rid="CIT0057" class="xref">57</xref>] shows high prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. It could be argued that with less local food produced due to climate change, a heavier reliance on imported food, often of poor nutritional quality, is contributing to high levels of NCDs.
