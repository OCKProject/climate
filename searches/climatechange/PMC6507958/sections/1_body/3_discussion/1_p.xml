<p class="p">This paper provides a comprehensive up-to-date narrative review of literature on climate change, food security and health in Kiribati. There is limited peer-reviewed literature that specifically examines this subject, with many articles linking at most two subject areas. This review therefore included non-peer-reviewed literature to enable a more comprehensive analysis of the situation in Kiribati.</p>
