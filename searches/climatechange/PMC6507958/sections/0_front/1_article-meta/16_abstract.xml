 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Background</bold>: Climate change is recognised as having a ‘multiplier effect’ on food insecurity and adverse health experiences of communities in the Pacific region. Islands are especially at risk due to their limited land availability, population pressures and, in the case of atolls, their low-lying topography making them vulnerable to sea level rise.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Aim</bold>: This review examines the literature describing the relationship between climate change, food security and health in Kiribati.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Method</bold>: A narrative review was conducted, looking at both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature available online from 1 January 2008 to 14 August 2018, the search date. Sources from three databases of peer-reviewed literature, Google and additional sources from reference lists were included in the review.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Results</bold>: Thirty-seven items were included in this review. These show climate change is having a noticeable impact on food security and health in Kiribati. Four themes were identified from the literature that provide different perspectives to the problem outlined.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Conclusion</bold>: Climate change is a pressing concern for the government of Kiribati and communities alike, and yet the problem is worsening, not improving. Further research is required to look at effective policies and cultural perspectives to address this problem.
