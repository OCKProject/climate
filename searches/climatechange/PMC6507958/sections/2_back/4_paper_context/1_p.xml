<p class="p">Climate change is recognised as having a ‘multiplier effect’ on food insecurity and adverse health experiences of communities in the Pacific region. Islands are especially at risk due to their limited land availability, population pressures and, in the case of atolls, their low-lying topography making them vulnerable to sea level rise. Kiribati is considered a ‘textbook case’ for climate change studies due to its high vulnerability to climate impacts.</p>
