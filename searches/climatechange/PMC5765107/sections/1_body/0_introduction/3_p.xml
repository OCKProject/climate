 </sup>. Of these factors, drought or dryness have often resulted from increases in the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) and soil water deficit, and from decreases in precipitation. However, there is uncertainty about whether the current trends of regional aridity will intensify or weaken, which partly reflect AED estimation methods

 </sup> recently assessed the risks to ecosystems mainly including forest, shrubland, grassland and cultivated land in China from climate change when (1) the adverse variance was beyond the typical natural variability of NPP, and (2) there was the possibility that, in the future, the NPP would fall below the minimum NPP during the baseline period. However, we have little information regarding how the risks might respond to climate change, though it is important when assessing future impacts in forests in China. More importantly, there have been few quantitative assessments of the rates at which risk might change as regional mean temperatures increase.
