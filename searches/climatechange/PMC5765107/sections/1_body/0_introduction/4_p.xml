<p id="Par5" class="p">The primary objectives of this study were therefore to (1) quantify the spatio-temporal patterns of different levels of risks indicated by the loss of forest NPP under future climate change in China, (2) investigate how the rate of regional climate change risks would vary in response to warming in the future, and (3) address the relative contributions of climatic factors to the risks. To achieve these objectives, we modeled NPP by modifying the AED sub-model in the Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM), which was driven by a set of general circulation models (GCMs) with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that covered the period 1981–2100. Our research highlighted the different levels of risks to forests from climate change, and it should give us an improved understanding of how forest ecosystems will respond to future climate change.</p>
