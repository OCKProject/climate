<p id="Par31" class="p">The risk of climate change to forest in China is likely to be relatively obvious under RCP8.5 compared with low emission scenarios especially in the long term. In response to future climate change, the total risk area is predicted to first decrease and then increase after the middle of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The percentage area at high risk was predicted to increase from 5.39% (2021–2050) to 27.62% (2071–2099) with a trend of 3.2% per decade (p &lt; 0.01). The forest vegetation growth would probably be weakened as the degree of warming increased under RCP8.5.
