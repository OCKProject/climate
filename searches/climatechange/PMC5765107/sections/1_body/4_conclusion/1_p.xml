<p id="Par30" class="p">In this study, we modified the AED and fire modules of the LPJ model and investigated spatial and temporal features of climate change risk faced by forest in China in the 21th century under different RCPs. The risk rating predicted in this study from the relationships between decreases in NPP and baseline variability (indicated by the standard deviation) highlighted the adverse impact of future climate change on vegetation productivity. The area of forest NPP at risk in China showed a general tendency to decrease from 2011 to 2099 relative to the baseline period of 1981–2010, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0. High-level risk area would increase especially in RCP4.5 (0.7% per decade, p &lt; 0.01) and RCP6.0 (1.7% per decade, p &lt; 0.01).</p>
