<p id="Par27" class="p">We found that the total area of forest in China at risk from climate change would first decrease and then increase as the warming accelerated under RCP8.5. The future projections of forest risk to climate change indicate that climate warming may be beneficial to vegetation growth to a minor extent, but when the climate change exceeds a certain threshold, the impacts could be negative. While increases in temperature could enhance plant photosynthesis, they could also cause a water vapor pressure deficit. The leaf stomata would then close to prevent water loss and increase water use efficiency

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect, rapid temperature increases and increased frequency of drought events could cause a decrease in the NPP in tropical and subtropical forests, and even in the global terrestrial NPP, under relatively high emission scenarios
