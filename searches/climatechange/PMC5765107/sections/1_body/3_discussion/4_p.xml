<p id="Par29" class="p">There are uncertainties in risk forecasts in vegetation productivity from several sources, including emission scenarios, climate models, and ecological models. For instance, due to the large discrepancy in future projections of precipitation from global to regional scale

When estimating forest biomass and productivity, accurate descriptions and determinations of allometry and allometric scaling parameters, respectively, are important

 </sup>. There was a considerable difference between the simulated and observed data in the forest NPP in the tropical humid region for the baseline period, which probably reflects the fact that there were only seven site records from this area, thereby causing high uncertainty. To measure this kind of uncertainty, the time series of observed NPP from 1981 to 2010 are needed to compute the standard deviation and to further calculate the risk. Nevertheless, due to the lack of time series data in the observed NPP across China

 </sup>, we are unable to quantify the uncertainty resulting from the difference between simulations and observations. Further, different ways of assessing risk may also create uncertainties. For example, baseline values may differ depending on whether they are derived from the global average or regional average, and variable values may exceed natural variability when they are beyond the mean plus or minus several standard deviations

 </sup> defined risk as the product of probability and vulnerability, and used the difference in NPP between hazardous condition and normal climate to indicate ecosystem vulnerability. Although the method is explicit in mathematics and easy to operate, it seems more suitable to the risk induced by single hazard factor and the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous conditions mainly depended on the subjective experience. In addition to the impact of climate change, human activities like forest management measures may also drive changes in ecosystem
