<p id="Par14" class="p">Proven as a useful tool for simulating the structure and function of large-scale ecosystems, the LPJ is driven by data of monthly climate and soil texture. The model comprises 10 plant functional types (PFTs), defined by bioclimatic limits and physiological optima, which compete for resources and determine vegetation composition. We used the method outlined by Zhao

 </sup> to adjust a few of the PFT parameters, mainly including the maximum coldest monthly mean temperatures of boreal needle-leaved evergreen forest, boreal needle-leaved summergreen forest and boreal broad-leaved summergreen forest, to fit the characteristics of ecosystems in China.
