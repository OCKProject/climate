<p id="Par17" class="p">Projections of climate change under various scenarios are useful for predicting future changes to ecosystems and their response to global change. We used scenario analysis to assess risk development and the impacts of climate change. Because of the uncertainty associated with GCMs, we simulated forest NPP with multiple GCM projections and used the mean from multiple models to characterize the risk under different emission scenarios. We used five GCMs in this study from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, including HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC-ESMCHEM, and NorESM1-M
