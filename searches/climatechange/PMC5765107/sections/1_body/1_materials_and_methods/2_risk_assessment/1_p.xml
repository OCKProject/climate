 </sup>. In this study, we considered that there was risk when the absolute value of future negative anomaly of NPP exceeded the IAV for the period from 1981 to 2010, based on the LPJ simulations. The risks were ranked to correspond with the multiple relationships between the decreases in the NPP and the baseline IAV. Using the simulated NPP, we judged the risk at each pixel and counted the area of forest at risk based on smoothed data, i.e. 30-year running mean NPP. Linear trends in the time series of risk were detected by the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method; the statistical significance of the trends was determined by the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test.
