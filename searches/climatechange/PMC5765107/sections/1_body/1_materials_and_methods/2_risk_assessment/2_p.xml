<p id="Par9" class="p">Specifically, we calculated the anomalies of the forest NPP in China for future periods (from 2021 to 2050 and from 2071 to 2099) from the baseline period (from 1981 to 2010). Positive anomalies indicated no risk. Negative anomalies were compared with their baseline standard deviation to indicate different levels of risk for each pixel. In line with the criteria and indicators applied by Scholze

 </sup>, the risks were deemed low, medium, and high level when the absolute values of the negative NPP anomaly were less than half of the standard deviation (

 <italic class="italic">α</italic> &lt; 1), or greater than one standard deviation (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> &gt; 1), respectively. In this study, we paid more attention to abnormal variabilities in the NPP that were less than the average minus a number of standard deviations, as a certain loss of productivity outside the typical natural NPP variability was perceived to be an unacceptable impact from climate change

 </sup>. From this, we then classified the risk levels from the multiple relationships between the anomalies and standard deviation.
