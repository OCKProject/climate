 </sup>. The 30-year averaged NPP varied spatially and gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>); the vegetation type also varied and transitioned from woodland to grassland. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> showed the distribution of baseline standard deviation in NPP, which was basically opposite to the pattern of its multi-year mean value and was relatively higher in North China and Hainan Island. The simulated values essentially agreed with the field measurements of NPP for more than 700 sites spread across the different eco-geographical regions in China, published in the Global Primary Production Data Initiative Products database

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). At each field site, a relative error could be estimated from the difference between simulated value and observed value, which was then divided by the observed value and expressed as a percentage. The average relative error over the whole country was 9.94%, which was acceptable and shows that the modified LPJ model gave satisfactory simulations of terrestrial NPP in China, and could be used to predict carbon cycling in ecosystems.
