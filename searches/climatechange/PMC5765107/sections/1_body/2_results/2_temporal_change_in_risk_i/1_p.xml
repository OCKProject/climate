<p id="Par20" class="p">Changes in the areas of climate change risk faced by forest systems in China under the four RCPs are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. There was a general decrease in the forest area at risk in China in the future, especially under the relatively low emission scenarios. Under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, the risk area was predicted to decrease noticeably in the first half of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century and then fluctuate gently in the second half. For the highest emission scenario RCP8.5, the risk area was first predicted to decrease and then to increase from around the 2050s, which was mainly determined by the change in the high-level risk area. The total areas at risk between 2011 and 2099 were predicted to average 15.58%, 23.64%, 33.22% and 36.07% under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, respectively. For the different risk levels, the forest area at medium risk was less than that the area at low risk and did not exceed 10% over most periods, while the area at high risk exhibited significant increasing trends except RCP2.6. Toward the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, the high-risk area was projected to increase at trends of 0.7% (p &lt; 0.01), 1.7% (p &lt; 0.01) and 3.2% (p &lt; 0.01) per decade under RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, respectively.
