 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref> shows changes in the percentage of the area at risk in response to variations in the temperature anomalies predicted by the different GCMs under RCP8.5, processed by quadratic curve fitting. The corresponding rates of change, namely the first derivative of the functions shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref>, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8b</xref>. When the temperature increased by between 0.80 ± 0.21 °C and 5.76 ± 1.40 °C relative to the baseline (9.76 ± 0.08 °C), the risk area was predicted to first decrease and then increase so that it covered half of the total forest area. The rate of change in the risk area percentage was predicted to first slow down and then accelerate, with the most obvious change predicted by the GFDL-ESM2M. The multi-model mean values show that the NPP risk area made up approximately 38% of the whole forest area in China when the temperature increased by about 3 °C under RCP8.5; for a temperature increase of about 6 °C, the NPP risk area was predicted to extend to almost 55% of the forest area, with a rate of change of 13% °C
