<p id="Par22" class="p">The model predicted that the forest NPP risk pattern in China would be noticeably different for the period 2071–2099 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) than for 2021–2050, with the total risk areas accounting for 8.95%, 16.94%, 28.48%, and 46.17% under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Decreases in the low and medium risk areas mainly explain the sharp decline in the total risk area predicted for the first three RCPs between the periods 2071–2099 and 2021–2050. Some of the low and medium risk areas were predicted to translate into high risk, though this mainly affected areas in southern China. Furthermore, the high-risk area accounted for the largest percentage of the total risk area under RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, while the medium risk area accounted for the smallest portion. The area of forest at risk under RCP8.5 was predicted to be greater during 2071–2099 than 2021–2050 under RCP8.5, mainly because of a significant increase in the high-risk area. This high-risk area was predicted to extend from southern and central China to northeastern China, accounting for 27.62% of the total forest area.
