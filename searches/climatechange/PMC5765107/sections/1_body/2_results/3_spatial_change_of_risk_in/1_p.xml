<p id="Par21" class="p">To reflect the change in spatial patterns of future risk, two typical periods of 2021–2050 and 2071–2099 were selected in this study, representing mid and long terms. Results from the other periods could be found in Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>-
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>. The risk of climate change to the forest NPP in China is predicted to be aggravated for all scenarios from 2021 to 2050 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The risk area is predicted to be mainly concentrated in the tropical humid and southern subtropical humid regions under the two relatively low emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5). For the higher emission scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), this area is likely to extend northward to the mid-subtropical humid region and the northern subtropical humid region. The total risk areas for the four RCPs covered 21.14%, 31.82%, 42.61%, and 40.24% of the whole forest area (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Moreover, the low risk area was predicted to account for the largest part of the total risk area, while the high-risk area was predicted to account for the smallest portion. The forest area at low risk was highest under RCP6.0 and was distributed continuously through the areas south of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Under RCP8.5, the risks to the forest in the southeast and southwest areas were mainly medium and high. The areas predicted to have medium and high risk under RCP6.0 were predicted to increase significantly from 11.76% and 1.19% to 14.35% and 5.39%, respectively, under RCP8.5.
