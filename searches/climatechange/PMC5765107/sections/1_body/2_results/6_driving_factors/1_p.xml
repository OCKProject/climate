<p id="Par25" class="p">We attributed the IAV of NPP to different climatic factors by calculating the partial correlation coefficients between NPP and precipitation (PRE), temperature (TEM), and aridity index (AED/PRE) for the period 2071–2099 under RCP8.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>). There were significant positive correlations between temperature and forest NPP, mainly in northeastern China and in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, which occupied 9.60% of the total forest area. Significant negative correlations between precipitation and forest NPP accounted for a larger proportion (15.53%) and were mainly limited to southern China. Substantial temperature rise was projected to occur in Northeast China, whereas the relatively slight increase of precipitation seemed to be distributed in Southeast China. The aridity index tended to increase obviously for these areas, implying potential droughts in the long term under high emission scenario. The aridity index and NPP were significantly and negatively correlated for nearly half of the forests (49.84%), ranging from northeastern China to southern China, indicating that increased dryness would limit forest growth in these regions. Therefore, of the three variables, the projected aridity index seemed to have a greater impact on the forest NPP, both in its degree and extent, which means that risks of a decrease in the forest NPP were mainly because of dryness.
