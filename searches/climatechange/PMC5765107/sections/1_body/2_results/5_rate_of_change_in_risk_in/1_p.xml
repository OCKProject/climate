<p id="Par24" class="p">We further analyzed the rate of change in risk in response to precipitation change. Results showed that the percentage of risk area was projected to decrease in the future, as the precipitation anomaly ranged from −2.11 ± 2.46% to 10.13 ± 8.21% relative to the baseline period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a</xref>). For every additional percentage point increase in precipitation, the area at risk tended to decrease by 1.67% of the total forest area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9b</xref>). In terms of the difference among GCMs, IPSL-CM5A-LR showed a small range of precipitation change and a quick drop of NPP risk area; the area at risk was projected to turn from decreasing to increasing, when the precipitation increased by about 13% in the case of HadGEM2-ES.
