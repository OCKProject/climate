<p class="p">Several factors must be considered before interpreting our model predictions regarding the expansions and changes in the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic>. First, as with all ixodid ticks, 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> spends most of its life cycle off the host and in the environment, so climate change may have direct effects on its abundance and distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Second, other abiotic factors (e.g. land use, soil characteristics), and biotic factors (e.g., host abundance and competition with other species), should be considered in tandem with climate effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Third, newly suitable areas must be accessible to 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> via dispersal for actual range expansions to take place [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. For example, migratory birds are potential agents of tick dispersal across new regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Migratory bird-mediated dispersal may allow 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> to respond to improving conditions in some of the expansion areas, and create new biotic combinations suitable for circulation of tick-borne pathogens.
