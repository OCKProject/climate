 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] in using 6 climate variables for analysis, the most updated RCPs, many more individual GCMs, and the IPCC 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> Assessment scenarios for 2050 and 2070. Also, we used diverse data sources, and focused on Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, to develop predictions of the potential distribution of this tick species into the future. We did not include western Asia in our study owing to a lack of sufficient occurrence data from this region. In addition, we included mobility-oriented parity (MOP) to understand certainty and uncertainty in different areas in the region of interest [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, whereas the results of the two studies did not differ qualitatively, our work provides a clearer picture of certainty and uncertainty in these predictions for an important disease vector species.
