<p class="p">Tick-borne diseases such as TBE and LB are greatly influenced by tick ecology and other factors such as habitat structure, climate, human activities, and the community of vertebrate species that are reservoir hosts for the tick-borne pathogens [

 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic>. Indeed, expansions of northern distributional limits have been reported for this species in Norway and Sweden since the 1980s [

 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> have been recorded in the Czech Republic and Switzerland [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Our results also showed that the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> will increase in the European Alps with high certainty. Increased TBE transmission in Europe during the last 2 decades has been attributed to climate change, socio-economic changes, and anthropogenic activities [
