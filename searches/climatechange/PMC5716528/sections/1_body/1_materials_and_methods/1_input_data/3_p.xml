<p class="p">We obtained data on 19 “bioclimatic” variables from the WorldClim climate data version 1.4 [

These variables were derived from interpolation of average monthly temperature and rainfall data obtained from weather stations during 1950–2000. We removed variables 8–9 and 18–19 because of known spatial artefacts. We used the data layers at 10’ spatial resolution because of the continental extent of our models. We obtained parallel data layers for 17 general circulation models (GCMs;

We chose two representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (corresponding to lower and higher greenhouse gas emissions, respectively) for 2050 and 2070 to account for possible climate change influences in both scenarios and in two different times. We used diverse GCMs available from the WorldClim archive to estimate both the future distributional potential of
