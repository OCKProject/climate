 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189092.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Sampling was concentrated in Great Britain and Germany thanks to surveillance by the European Vector Map Program of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC;

The initial set of occurrence records was subjected to several data cleaning steps to reduce possible biases in calibrating ecological niche models (ENMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. (1) We discarded all records with unknown geographic references, and removed all duplicate records. (2) The data were further filtered by distance, so that all redundant records occurring in a single 10â€™ cell (~20 km) were omitted. (3) Finally, we accounted for marked differences in sampling density across countries: data records were filtered by balancing the density of occurrences on a country-by-country basis. We chose Spain as a reasonable intermediate-density reference point (6 occurrence records /100,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) to overcome problems associated with oversampling or undersampling observed in some countries. Although we discarded large numbers of data points, this step removes large-scale spatial biases, and allows a better estimation of niche characteristics [
