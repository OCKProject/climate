<p class="p">Mobility-oriented parity (MOP) was used to assess the degree of novelty of climate conditions under all future climate scenarios (i.e., 17 GCMs x 2 RCPs x 2 time periods) relative to present-day conditions. This novelty is actually a distance in environmental space between the environmental characteristics of the site in question and the set of environments represented across the reference region. In the present study, the site in question is generally in a future time period, and the reference region is in the present. MOP evaluates the general novelty of conditions, and highlights regions where strict extrapolation (i.e. values outside of the range of environments in the reference region/time) occurs, to give a view of certainty and uncertainty across various sectors of the region of interest [

To summarize MOP results within each RCP, we counted the number of GCMs for which each pixel was strictly extrapolative, and also calculated the average distance from the reference (present) conditions.
