 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Several recent publications have presented predictions of how climate change will alter the distribution of vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks, sandflies, and mosquitoes. These studies investigate how changes in spatial distributions of arthropod vectors may influence future spatial distributions of vector-borne pathogens [
