 <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</italic> is the most common arthropod vector of human disease in Europe and nearby regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. This tick species infests a wide variety of wild vertebrate species, as well as other accidental hosts, such as humans, livestock, and companion animals [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</italic> transmits a wide variety of tick-borne pathogens, including the spirochete bacteria of the 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato (sl) species complex and the tick-borne encephalitis virus. These pathogens are transmitted to humans mostly by bites of immature nymphs, which are more abundant, smaller and therefore harder to notice than adult ticks [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Some species of the 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">burgdorferi</italic> sl complex cause Lyme disease (or Lyme borreliosis, LB) and tick-borne encephalitis virus causes tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). LB is prevalent in Central Europe where the highest infection rates have been recovered from ixodid ticks [
 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. TBE occurs in eastern, western, and central Europe, as well as in Russia [

 <xref rid="pone.0189092.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Active surveillance of both diseases in Europe indicates a need to study the distributional ecology of their vector,
