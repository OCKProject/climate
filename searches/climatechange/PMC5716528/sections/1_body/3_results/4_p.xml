 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189092.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). In terms of agreement between present and future conditions, range expansion was indicated in North Africa in the coastal regions of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Under RCP 4.5 for the 2050s, expansions are expected (although with low confidence) in North Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern and Northern Europe. Under RCP 8.5 for the 2050, the expansions in Eastern and Northern Europe, Turkey, and the Middle East were predicted to be wider compared to RCP 4.5 for 2050. In 2070, suitable areas for
