<p class="p">Models based on present-day conditions revealed areas with high suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> across Central and Western Europe including the countries of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, and Italy. In Northern Europe, the highest suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> was in southern Finland, southern Sweden, and western Norway. Suitable areas also occurred in western Turkey, the Middle East, and in more restricted areas in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Transferring models to future conditions, the present-day and future distributional patterns largely coincided. However, our model predictions indicated some potential for expansion into areas not identified as suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> under present-day conditions, particularly in Northern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189092.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), albeit with high uncertainty with respect to the potential distributions in both present and future.
