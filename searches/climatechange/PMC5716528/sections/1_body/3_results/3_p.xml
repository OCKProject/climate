<p class="p">Under present-day conditions, low uncertainty (deriving from availability of occurrence data) was observed across the study area (which can be uncertainty as regards prediction of presence or prediction of absence), except some areas in Morocco, Ireland, and eastern Norway (

Under future conditions, the levels of uncertainty varied among RCP scenarios and time periods, but this variation was not necessarily related to the density of the available occurrence data. For RCP 4.5 in 2050, high uncertainty was concentrated in southern Finland, central Norway, and Sweden, and medium uncertainty was present in parts of Eastern Europe and North Africa, whereas lower uncertainty was in Western Europe and the Middle East. For RCP 8.5 for the 2050s, high uncertainty was restricted to southern Finland, eastern Sweden, southern Spain, and northern Morocco; low uncertainty areas were in Western Europe and the Middle East. For RCP 4.5 for the 2070s, models showed high uncertainty in Finland, Norway, central and northern Sweden, and eastern Belarus. RCP 8.5 for the 2070s showed high uncertainty in Finland, eastern Sweden, eastern Belarus, and eastern Ukraine; low uncertainty was in Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East (
