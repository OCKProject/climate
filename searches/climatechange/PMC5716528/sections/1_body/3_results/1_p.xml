<p class="p">After detailed data cleaning and spatial balancing, our initial total of 5107 occurrence points for 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> from diverse sources was filtered and reduced to 416 spatially unique points at 10â€™ resolution. This data filtering reduced problems associated with artificial clumping of occurrence records, which is related to biases in sampling and reporting (

 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ricinus</italic> based on the 5 subgroups of occurrence points yielded predictions that gave area under the curve (AUC) ratios above null expectations in all five partial ROC analyses (
