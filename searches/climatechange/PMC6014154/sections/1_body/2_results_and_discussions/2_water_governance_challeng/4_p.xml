<p class="p">There is a general consensus that irrigation should be a means of increasing adaptation to Climate Change in both villages. However, this should be approached carefully as it calls for innovative ways – both technical and institutional – on how often scarce water resources are managed. Further accessibility to water resources is not uniform as sources of water in the village vary. The outflow channel constructed by the sugar company for the village provided tangible solutions for agricultural production under the semi-arid conditions. To sustain food production therefore calls for governments’ review of the water legislation. This includes clarification of operational rules for commercial water users in response to subsistent farmers’ irrigation challenges associated with climate risks. Additionally, there is a need for intervention in negotiations with the company. A possible solution is for Malawi government to partner with the company to ensure continuous supply of water to the village and on a wider scale, to cover more farmers. This will be in line with international agreements on effective water governance. For example, the UN 2000 Millennium Assembly emphasised conservation and stewardship in protecting our common environment and especially

This was endorsed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 where Heads of State agreed a specific target

Operational rules specify what resource users are constrained, allowed and expected to do (Ostrom
