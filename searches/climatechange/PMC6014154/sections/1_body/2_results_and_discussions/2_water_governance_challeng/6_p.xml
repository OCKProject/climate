<p class="p">In addition, there is need to reduce water use demand for irrigation through supporting of other local desired interventions that are not directly linked to irrigation because climate projections and water demand for the study area suggest increased water shortages or water stress by 2025 (Southern African Development Community 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:6). These interventions include external support on improved sorghum and livestock production and links to profitable markets. Alternatively, there is need to build farmers’ capacity on climate SMART agriculture, an integrative approach to address interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. The approach may therefore be applied in the area through promoting conservation of water, for example, tower gardening, or provide shared tariffs between the sugar company and farmers to enhance the sense of responsibility and reduce water use by farmers. This could apply agreed monetary or nonmonetary tools. In essence, this implies that ‘the consumer will change his or her consumption preferences. Regulatory instruments that involve permits, restrictions, and allocations to various users and uses can also reduce water demand’ (Global Water Partnership 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>:23) or ensure sustainable and equitable use of water. However, these instruments should not exclude the poor farmers from benefiting from the resource. Development of the instruments can be done in a participatory approach involving all the relevant stakeholders including the local farmers, local sugar company and state actors.
