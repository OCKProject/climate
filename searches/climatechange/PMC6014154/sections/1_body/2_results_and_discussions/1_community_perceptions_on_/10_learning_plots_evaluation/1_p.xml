<p class="p">The results from the learning plots and farmersâ€™ gardens showed a complete crop failure for the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 growing seasons. In the first experimental year, rain-fed maize performed fairly well on tied ridges despite the prolonged dry spells experienced. Although, there was no yield because of late planting, the learning plot crop stand was healthier than nearby gardens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). In the third year (2010/2011), farmers did not register any yield, whereas some yield was nevertheless obtained from the experimental plots. In 2011, the highest maize yield under rain-fed production was 0.8 t per ha from box ridges with manure and inorganic fertilisers. The low-yielding but early-maturing variety, SC 403 yielded 0.7 t per ha, which was higher than the late-maturing but high-yielding variety, DK 8033 which provided 0.05 t per ha. Overall average yield performance showed that tie ridges was the best tillage method for seedbed preparation, whereas flat cultivation recorded the lowest yield of maize. Variety evaluation showed higher yields for the maize varieties ZM 309 and SC 403 than DKC 8033. The maize yield almost doubled with manure application combined with inorganic fertiliser, which is attributable to water conservation properties of manure which helped the crop during prolonged dry spells, in addition to provision of nutrients. This result concurs with Achieng

 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:436), who reported that farmyard manure from a combination of cow dung and urine provide a balanced nutrition to plants and hence enhance crop productivity. Reduction in maize yield is mainly attributed to midseason drought or prolonged dry spells (
 <xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>) and increasing prevalence of the crop pests. The communities also associate proliferation of pests with impacts of climate change or variability such as high temperatures and very low rainfall. The prevalent crop pests in the village include stalk borers (
