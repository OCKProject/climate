<p class="p">The cropping calendar for all the crops has experienced changes because of changes in rainfall pattern (
 <xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Farm activities under the calendar are largely dictated by the onset of rainfall and distribution. Because of the changes experienced, staggered planting is also becoming a common practice in the village. Farmers can in some years plant up to five times until rains are stable. Additionally, following the recent climatic events, for the last 10 years, rain-fed maize production is on the decline, whereas the acreage of cotton and sorghum is on the rise. Farmers reported persistent declining rain-fed maize yield and high yield for irrigated maize. Maize production is mainly done under treadle pump irrigation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), with irrigated area per household ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 acres. These changes have been necessitated as a response to the current changes in the yield/acre (productivity) of the recent cropping years.
