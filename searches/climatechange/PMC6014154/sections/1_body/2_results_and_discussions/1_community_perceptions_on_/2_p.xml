<p class="p">The community perceived that the area was now experiencing variations in climate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The key indicators reported were high rainfall variability, characterised by unpredictable seasonal rainfall pattern, warmer days and cooler nights (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In terms of rainfall, the villagers reported that the area had also been experiencing variable, but late onset of rains, with the onset shifting from November to December. However, the rainfall season has become shorter as the late onset is more often followed by early cessation of rainfall. The amount of rainfall is also perceived to have declined because of frequent prolonged dry spells and droughts experienced in the course of the wet season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The people also observed that the midseason drought has become an annual event in the past 5 years. The area can therefore experience a good onset of rains followed by a prolonged dry spell, for example, for a month (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The rains pick up towards the end when food crops such as maize had already wilted, hence leading to low yield. Occurrence of strong winds and cold nights during the rainy season also affect the rainfall pattern adversely. Strong winds are also known to drive away clouds, whereas low temperatures reduce evaporation as well as rainfall amounts.
