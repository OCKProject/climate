<p class="p">Climate change and variability is a key challenge especially in semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa where peoples’ livelihoods are predominantly dependent on subsistence rain-fed agricultural production (Hulme

Many parts of Africa, including those deemed to be well endowed with abundant water resources, are already experiencing water stress conditions because of pressures such as rapid population growth (Urama &amp; Ozor 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:29). Climate change will further compound the already existent water stress conditions. As the water stress conditions intensify, many areas are likely to experience frequent occurrences of water-related conflicts as water and food security is threatened (Brown, Hammill &amp; Mcleman 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:1141–1154). However, it has been observed that the most vulnerable people to the worst impacts of climate change are those with the least ability to cope with the associated risks (Adger
