<p class="p">Rural communities are the most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and variability because of their low adaptive capacity (Adger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>:179–195). Adaptive capacity may be defined as the ability or capacity of a system to modify or change its characteristics or behaviour in order to cope better with existing or anticipated external stresses (Adger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>:179–195). Adaptation to climate change is the adjustment of a natural or human system to moderate the impacts of climate change, to take advantage of new opportunities or to cope with the consequences (Adger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>:179–195). Adaptation is done in response to actual or expected impacts of climate change, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (Klein 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>:9).
