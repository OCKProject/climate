<p class="p">We used the Maxent software (version 3.3.3k) to build the habitat suitability model for the giant panda. This approach is considered one of the best performing algorithms in predicting species distribution with presence‐only data (Elith, Phillips, Hastie, Dudík, &amp; Chee, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). It has been extensively applied to project species range shifts under climate change (Li, Clinton, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lei, Xu, Cui, Guang, &amp; Ding, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Songer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Maxent estimates species distributions by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy, subject to the constraints of the data that are available (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Maxent also estimates the importance of variables and contributions representing the degree to which each variable has contributed to the model, based on jackknife tests. We divided the occurrence data of giant panda into training sets (75%) for model building, and testing sets (25%) for model evaluation, and conducted a subsample procedure (Khatchikian, Sangermano, Kendell, &amp; Livdahl, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wisz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) to evaluate the habitat suitability model by performing 15 replications in Maxent.
