<p class="p">Model performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AUC value closer to 1 represents near perfect performance of the model (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The output of Maxent comprised continuous values between 0 and 1 that were considered as probabilities of species’ occurrence. We then convert these values to presence and absence predictions, based on the threshold values that maximized training sensitivity plus specificity (Liu, Berry, Dawson, &amp; Pearson,
