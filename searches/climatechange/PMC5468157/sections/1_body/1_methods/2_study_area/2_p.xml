<p class="p">The study area is located in the Qinling Mountains (106°30′–108°05′E, 32°40′–34°35′N) in Shaanxi Province in China. The Qinling Mountains are characterized by a specific geographic system in terms of topography and climate, and include the boundary between the temperate and subtropical zones (Zhao, Zhang, &amp; Dong, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The mountains rise from 222 m to 3,734 m, with a gentler gradient on the southern slope; however, their northern face is generally steep (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Regarding the differences in climate between northern and southern China, the southern slope is generally warmer and moister than the northern face, and climatic conditions vary with elevation gradient (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Deciduous broadleaf and subtropical evergreen forests mainly inhabit at low elevation; temperate broadleaf and subalpine coniferous forests inhabit at mid‐elevation; and subalpine scrub meadows inhabit at high elevation (State Forestry Administration,

A total of 19 nature reserves (including eight national and nine provincial nature reserves, and two at the application stage) have been established to protect giant panda and their habitat in this region (State Forestry Administration,
