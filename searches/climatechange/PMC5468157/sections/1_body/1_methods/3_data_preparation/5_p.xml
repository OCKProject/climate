<p class="p">All spatial layers were resampled into resolution of 1 × 1 km and projected to an equal area projection (Asia North Albers Equal Area Conic) using ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). We then calculated correlation coefficients between variables and eliminated one variable from each pair that was strongly correlated (|

Thirteen variables (annual precipitation, annual temperature range, density of rivers, density of roads, density of settlements, elevation, mean diurnal range, min. temperature of coldest month, precipitation of warmest quarter, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of driest quarter, precipitation of driest month, and temperature constancy) which were the most biologically meaningful for giant pandas were retained (Appendix

Then, we input the set of most important variables based on permutation importance obtained from first model output, to construct the giant panda finally distribution model, and rerun the Maxent models.
