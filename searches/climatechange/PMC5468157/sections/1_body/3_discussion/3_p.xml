<p class="p">Based on the model output, under a mild climate change scenario (RCP 4.5), 20.52% (SH
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>) of current suitable habitat of giant panda is projected to transfer to unsuitable habitat, particularly in the southwestern region of the Qinling Mountains (i.e., Chenggu and Liuba counties). Climate change associated with suitable habitat fragmentation would present another conservation challenge for this species (Holyoak &amp; Heath,

 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Current habitat connectivity in southwestern portion of Qinling Mountains is relatively low, and these areas are predicted to experience greatest loss by the 2050s due to climate change, thereby emphasizing the need for a regional conservation strategy for giant panda conservation to protect these areas, and constructing migration corridors to facilitate the dispersal of southwestern populations to large core areas. Fortunately, Ningshan county is predicted to have considerable areas of newly suitable habitat for giant panda. However, migration into the new areas may be impeded by both natural and artificial barriers (e.g., rivers, roads, and human settlements; Fan et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, proactive measures for habitat restoration should be taken to protect and improve the habitat for the species, and construct migration corridors to facilitate the dispersal of a greater number of giant panda to these new suitable habitats (that currently have a relatively small population of giant panda; Sun et al.,
