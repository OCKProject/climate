<p class="p">Over the past several decades, giant pandas have been exposed to several threats to their survival, such as bamboo flowering, extensive poaching, and habitat destruction (Li, Guo, Yang, Wang, &amp; Niemelä,

 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). However, the Chinese government has conducted giant panda conservation programs, and many of the key threats have been mitigated (Wei et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). At present, human disturbances (e.g., roads, construction projects, ecotourism, and environmental pollutants) and climate change are considered as the paramount threats that degrade and fragment panda habitat (Wei et al.,
