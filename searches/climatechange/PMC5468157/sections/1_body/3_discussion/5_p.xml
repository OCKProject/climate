<p class="p">Vulnerability assessments can provide information about the locations that are vulnerable to climate change (Levinsky et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and broadscale guidance to direct conservation efforts (Dubois, Caldas, Boshoven, &amp; Delach, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rowland et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Based on our vulnerability assessment, protection needs to prioritize habitat in which the maximum effects of climate change are predicted to occur, namely the vulnerable areas. These regions are predicted to suffer from large range contractions under climate change and present the greatest risk to the persistence of giant panda in the 2050s. Furthermore, vulnerability assessments are able to identify the potential climatic refuges for giant panda within Qinling Mountains range, namely unchanged and new increased suitability habitat (Ashcroft,

 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and these areas may facilitate species persistence during periods of climatic stress.
