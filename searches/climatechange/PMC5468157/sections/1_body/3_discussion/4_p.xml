<p class="p">An assessment of the impact of climate change on species is a critical initial step in implementing the adaptation planning process (Rowland et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Some nature reserves, among which planning had been done decades in advance, need to be re‐evaluated considering climate change (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hansen, Hoffman, Drews, &amp; Mielbrecht, 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Our results revealed that the loss of giant panda suitable habitat would affect the conservation effectiveness of the existing giant panda reserves. These reserves do not adequately protect the current suitable habitat of giant panda, nor will they protect future potential suitable habitat. Coping strategies to deal with potential threats, particularly in those nature reserves (i.e., Banqiao, Motianling, Panlong, Sanyuan) that would suffer the greatest loss of suitable habitat under future climate change, require further in‐depth study. Meanwhile, three provincial nature reserves located in Ningshan county are also urgent need to improve their conservation effectiveness against climate change, because they currently support a small population of giant panda (Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32981-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), but are isolated from the network of large reserves, and have low levels of protection (Figure
