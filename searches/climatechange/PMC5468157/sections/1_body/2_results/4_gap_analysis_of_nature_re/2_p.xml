 <xref rid="ece32981-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). In the 2050s, giant panda suitable habitat is predicted to suffer loss in nine nature reserves, among which Banqiao (AC = −21.66%), Motianling (AC = −100%), Niangniangshan (AC = −22.20%), Panlong (AC = −35.44%), Sangyuan (AC = −92.46%), Tiabaishan (AC = −22.83%), and Zhouzhi (AC = −9.87%) nature reserves estimated to suffer the greatest loss of suitable habitat in the 2050s. Climate change will increase the extent of the panda's distribution, mainly in the Huangguanshan, Pingheliang, and Yingzuishi nature reserves (Table
