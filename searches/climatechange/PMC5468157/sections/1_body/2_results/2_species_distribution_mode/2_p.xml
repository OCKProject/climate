<p class="p">In the Maxent model, 256 presence points and nine variables were finally used as model parameters to construct the giant panda distribution model. The average training AUC was 0.967 ± 0.001, and the average testing AUC was 0.961 ± 0.005. The permutation importance of variables in the model as ranked from the highest to the lowest were as follows: density of rivers (34.6%), annual precipitation (30.4%), mean diurnal range (15.4%), precipitation seasonality (5.3%), precipitation of warmest quarter (4.4%), density of roads (3.6%), annual temperature range (3.1%), density of settlements (2.0%), and temperature constancy (1.3%; Figure
