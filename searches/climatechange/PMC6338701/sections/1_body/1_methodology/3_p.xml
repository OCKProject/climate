<p id="Par15" class="p">To quantify the effect of climate change on groundwater nitrate content, an original mass balance approach, based on a lumped-parameter model, provides an evaluation of the impact of changing hydrological conditions on the selected aquifers. The approach presented by Thomann and Mueller (
