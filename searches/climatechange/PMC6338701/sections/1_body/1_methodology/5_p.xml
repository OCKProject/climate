<p id="Par17" class="p">This model assumes that diffuse nitrogen inputs,

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>), on the aquifer surface are completely mixed horizontally and vertically. This assumption seems reasonable based on the large extent of the agricultural land use compared to the aquifer thickness, especially on thin alluvial systems. Degradation, as due to denitrification processes, is represented by a first-order decay factor embedded as a reactive term, 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. Such a gross approximation provides a quick and useful portrait of the system behavior avoiding the elaboration of complex numerical flow and transports models. To solve the former equation, aquifer dimensions were estimated and porosity taken accordingly to the dominant lithology (Appendix 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Natural outflow, 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>, equal to the corresponding inflow to insure no changes in aquifer storage, were estimated in three different ways: (1) using the recharge rate estimated for the present day scenario (2005–2015) in uniform conditions for a period of 50 years; (2) using the recharge rate estimated for the hydrological conditions forecasted for 2050, also considered uniform during the simulation; and (3) assuming that recharge rate changes linearly at annual time steps from present hydrological conditions to those predicted by 2050. This third option implies that the initial concentration in the reservoir will also change annually as the inflow/outflow rate varies. Local water balance data for present and future climatic scenarios are derived from Mas-Pla et al. (
