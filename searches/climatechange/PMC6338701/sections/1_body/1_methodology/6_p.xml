<p id="Par18" class="p">The total mass of nitrate entering the aquifer considers a generalized application of 170 kg N/ha/year from livestock manure, as permitted by the EU Nitrates Directive. No other nitrogen inputs are considered. It is indeed difficult to assign future fertilization rates as input loads in the mass balance model. Even though future agricultural management will eventually reduce rates, it looks sensible to think that farmers will take the chance to apply as much fertilizer as allowed by law. Nitrogen uptake in each aquifer was calculated as the product of the nitrogen assimilation by each type of crop times the reported local production in 2016 and the total crop area in the considered aquifer. Details are given in Appendix 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. A first-order decay term for nitrate in aquifers due to natural denitrification processes is initially taken as 0.04 year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which is a lower, cautious value (Carroll et al.
