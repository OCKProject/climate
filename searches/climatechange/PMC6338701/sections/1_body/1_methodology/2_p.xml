<p id="Par14" class="p">Climate predictions allow estimating the subsequent modifications of the water budget for each hydrogeological system that will follow. So, climate data for the above-mentioned horizons were calculated after a downscaling process from global circulation models by Calbó et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>). This reference provides the averaged temperature increment and rainfall variations for different geographical/climatic areas in Catalonia. Water budgets in the hydrographic basins of Catalonia, with special interest of those corresponding to the studied aquifers, were estimated by Mas-Pla et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2016</xref>) using the temperature and precipitation projections by Calbó et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>) and the percentage of land use to compute actual evapotranspiration as determined by Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2001</xref>). To differentiate between runoff and infiltration terms, we use a map of average recharge based on the chloride mass balance by Alcalá and Custodio (
