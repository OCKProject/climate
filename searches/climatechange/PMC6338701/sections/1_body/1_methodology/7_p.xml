<p id="Par19" class="p">We herein profit climatic results and field data from existing information, and the outcomes of the nitrate mass balance model to discuss the impact of climate change on nitrate pollution for distinct hydrogeological settings using a water balance approach (e.g., Menció et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2010</xref>; Fitts 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2013</xref>, pp. 13–16). In other words, the effects of climate change on the components of the hydrologic cycle and the consequences on groundwater nitrate content are evaluated at the level of hydrological process and under distinct hydrogeological frameworks given by the geological idiosyncrasy of the selected aquifers.
