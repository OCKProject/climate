<p id="Par31" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the mean ratio between available resources (or “blue water”) and the precipitation (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>; where 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> stands for “available resources” and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> for “precipitation”) in the hydrological basins of the aquifers considered in this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values decrease in time from 2015 to 2050 pointing out the relative magnitude of the water loses in all the selected basins. Other recharge terms such as stream inflow to the aquifer and regional flow systems from the surrounding mountain ranges were not included for simplicity in the water budget approach. Nevertheless, the occurrence of these terms will later on be recovered for the discussion of nitrate fate under changing climatic conditions. It must be stated, however, that 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> estimations given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> assume uniform land uses for the first half of the twenty-first century. It is expected that agricultural areas will remain active in the plain areas and that some afforestation may happen in the hills or mountain areas as a result of crop abandonment. In this case, expected changes will be minor and, especially at higher altitude zones, they would represent an increase in evapotranspiration and, therefore, a diminution of available resources. Consequently, predicted values for 2050 shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> could be slightly overestimated as a result of excluding such land use variations.
