 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values. No specific estimations are available for the percentage of infiltrating groundwater from the total resources. Moreover, varying land cover distribution may introduce a large uncertainty of any potential estimation. In consequence, and for the sake of discussing climate change effects on nitrate polluted aquifers, some average values will be used. In this sense, Alcalá and Custodio (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2014</xref>) mapped the average recharge in continental Spain based on the atmospheric chloride mass balance, after a geostatistical analysis at a discretization grid of a 10 km × 10 km. Average groundwater recharge values for the selected aquifers, as estimated by Alcalá and Custodio (
