<p id="Par33" class="p">Regarding nitrate, the proportion between runoff and infiltration is important to determine nitrate leaching to groundwater. Soil parameters controlling the water balance, such as soil texture, organic content, hydraulic conductivity, wetting front pressure, field capacity residual water content and porosity, as well as ion exchange capacity, are key (Vachaud and Chen
