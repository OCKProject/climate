<p id="Par30" class="p">With the intention to estimate available water resources in the distinct basins of Catalonia under climate conditions predicted for 2021 and 2050, Mas-Pla et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2016</xref>) conducted a hydrologic water balance considering predicted rainfall to estimate precipitation inputs (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>) and predicted temperature and present land use cover at a sub-basin scale to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (AET) using Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2001</xref>) approach. These estimations are based on predicted data for at least two meteorological stations within or closer to the sub-basin boundaries. The difference between these two terms (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> and AET) provide the amount of available water resources as surface water and groundwater; in other words, the amount of “blue water” in contrast to “green water” (or evapotranspirated water), according to the intuitive terminology stated by Falkenmark and Rockström (
