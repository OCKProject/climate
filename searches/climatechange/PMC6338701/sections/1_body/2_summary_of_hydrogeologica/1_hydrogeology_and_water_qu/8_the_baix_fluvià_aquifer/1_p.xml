<p id="Par27" class="p">The unconfined aquifer of the Baix Fluvià consists on the upper sedimentary unit that constitutes the fluvio-deltaic system of the Fluvià River. Since most of the wells exploit such unconfined, 20-m-thick layer, no data were collected from the lower leaky aquifer. Recharge from the Fluvià River is also limited to the western reach. Mean nitrate concentration is 43 ± 7 mg/L.</p>
