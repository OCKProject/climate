<p id="Par25" class="p">Sampled wells in this aquifer are located in the alluvial-lacustrine sediments that fill the valleys in the volcanic area of La Garrotxa. Volcanic activity, especially, lava flows favourished the sedimentation of alluvial-lacustrine deposits which infilling correspond to the erosion of the sedimentary rocks from the surrounding ranges and to the lapilli and lava fragment eroded from the volcanic materials. The balance between nitrogen inputs and groundwater recharge results in low average nitrate content (mean concentration 35 ± 4 mg/L). Denitrification processes have not been identified in this aquifer.</p>
