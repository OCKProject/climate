<p id="Par20" class="p">This study considers data from five aquifers in Catalonia, all of them defined as vulnerable zones to nitrate pollution under the present legislation and the water agency management plans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). These aquifers represent distinct hydrogeological environments, so the climate change impact on the water budget can be discussed for different geological circumstances; for instance, it can be expected that stream-recharged unconfined aquifers will respond differently than confined aquifer systems under rainfall recharge variations. In general, nitrate origin is mostly related to fertilization practices using cattle rising manure.
