<p id="Par26" class="p">This hydrogeological system includes a Ter River fluvio-deltaic system and the surrounding sedimentary rocks of its southern margin. Stream recharge is relevant in the western zone, while the Ter River acts as a gaining stream in its central and lower reaches. Most of the nitrate concentration is found in the upper unconfined layer of the fluvial system, although also in the wells located in the sedimentary rock formations underlying agricultural areas. High nitrate content is usual, but nitrate occurrence is variably distributed; for instance, concentrations ranged from 6 to 480 mg/L in shallow aquifer, while they seldom achieve the 50 mg/L in the deeper layers. The overall mean concentration value in the shallow unit is 78 ± 9 mg/L. Denitrification occurs mainly in the alluvial layers where the occurrence of organic matter enhances the loss of nitrate by heterotrophic processes.</p>
