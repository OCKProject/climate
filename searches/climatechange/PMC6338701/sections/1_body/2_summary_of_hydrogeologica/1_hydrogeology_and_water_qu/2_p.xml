<p id="Par21" class="p">Data from the studied regions are summarized for each aquifer (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>); in particular: (1) aquifer type (water table, leaky, or confined); (2) origin of recharge: direct rainfall (representing soil infiltration and, therefore, leaching of sol nutrients and applied fertilizers), interaction with streams (considering discharge regime), and occurrence of recharge from mountain fronts or the basement according to the geological setting; and (3) mean and median nitrate content, percentage of samples showing denitrification, and (4) percentage of denitrification based on the multi-isotopic approach. In all these areas, land use is mainly occupied by agricultural and forested areas, and irrigation relies on groundwater; except in the Baix Ter system where surface water diversion from the Ter River is also used for irrigation.
