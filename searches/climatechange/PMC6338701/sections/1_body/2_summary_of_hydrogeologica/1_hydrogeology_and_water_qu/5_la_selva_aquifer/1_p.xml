<p id="Par24" class="p">This aquifer system consists of the sedimentary infilling of a tectonic depression originated during the Neogene. Sediments originated from the weathering and erosion of the surrounding ranges with igneous and metamorphic rocks and were deposited as alluvial fan systems. Therefore, it is formed by a multilayer aquifer with gravel, sand, and clay layers with a maximum thickness of near 200 m in its westernmost area. Small alluvial aquifers develop along the main streams, yet the maximum groundwater withdrawal originates from the Neogene unit. Fault zones located in its boundaries, as well as in the basement, allow the recharge of the sedimentary aquifer by upward vertical regional flows. These contribute to the potentiometric head recovery of the leaky aquifer layers in winter and spring. Nitrate content is high (mean value 65 ± 10 mg/L), with half of the sampling points above the threshold limit for water consumption. Denitrification is not intense and it has been only recorded in a few samples. Within the Selva aquifer, the case of the Onyar River aquifer has been considered as an example of a thin alluvial, with an intense agricultural activity and high nitrate content (mean concentration 61 ± 7 mg/L).</p>
