<p id="Par23" class="p">The Osona hydrogeological system develops on the Tertiary sedimentary rocks in central Catalonia, characterized by a suite of sandstone and marl layers. The fracture network in these consolidated sedimentary rocks controls groundwater flow and infiltration. Surface deposits (regoliths, colluviums) that sustain agricultural activity retain fertilizer inputs that lately infiltrate to the underlying sedimentary layers. Nitrate mean value is 165 ± 18 mg/L, which indicates the occurrence of very high concentrations. The influence of groundwater exploitation forces nitrate polluted water downward through the fractured marls that act as aquitards. After decades of intense (and initially unregulated) fertilization practices, high nitrate concentrations are usual in this area. Denitrification due to sulfate reduction is found in the northwestern and north central areas where pyrite occurs within the marly sediments.</p>
