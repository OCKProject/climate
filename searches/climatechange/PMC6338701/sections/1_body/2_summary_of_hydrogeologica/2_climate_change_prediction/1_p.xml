<p id="Par28" class="p">Present climate projections derived from climatic/atmospheric models provide estimates for temperature (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>) variations for the next decades. In most cases, downscaling processes are necessary to refine such predictions and to offer more appropriate data to hydrologists so future water budgets can be estimated with the predicted parameters. Calbó et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>) calculated the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation projection for 2021 and 2050 using distinct climatic databases (MERCAT, ESTCENA, EuroCORDEX, CMIP5, and DCPP), as well as distinct downscaling methods (dynamic and statistic), for the distinct geographical areas in Catalonia, namely, Pyrenees, inland areas, and coastal areas. Downscaling resolution varied according the method and the area of application, and it ranged between 0.04 to 0.2°. Such scaling approaches are necessary, especially for rainfall, as in areas such as Catalonia, the complex orography and land-sea contrast are largely misrepresented by global models.
