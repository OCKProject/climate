<p id="Par29" class="p">The analyzed climate projections by Calbó et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>) reveal a robust temperature rising trend over Catalonia for the coming decades over all geographical/climatic areas of Catalonia. Using the median from all downscaled datasets, the surface temperature will potentially increase by + 0.8 °C during the current decade (2021) and even reach + 1.4 °C by mid-century (2050), as compared to the reference period 1971–2000 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The rising trends may be even more powerful for the Pyrenean region, particularly in summer. For rainfall, the climate projections show a decreasing trend, but with an uncertain slope. Indeed, variation of rainfall rate in the current decade is barely significant. By 2050, on the contrary, a decrease in rainfall is clear, with a median in distribution of estimated values around − 10% in spring, summer, and autumn. Average annual decrease in Catalonia is − 6.8%, being larger in the coastal areas (− 8.3%) and smaller in the Pyrenees (− 5.3%). These projections are based on moderate emission scenarios of radiative forcing (i.e., A1B, RCP4.5), and consequently, other estimated values associated with future climate change might be slightly higher than those herein introduced.
