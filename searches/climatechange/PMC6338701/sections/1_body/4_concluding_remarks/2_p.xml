<p id="Par64" class="p">Even though simulated trends points out a future decline of nitrate content in groundwater, this hydrological analysis makes clear that controlling nitrogen inputs originated from fertilization stands as the key point in management strategies, especially in alluvial and fluvio-deltaic aquifers with small turnover times. This statement is already considered by good agricultural practice programs and the analysis of climate change effects that arise from the mass balance model indicates that just a no-action response, keeping business as usual, is not necessarily an erroneous option. Given the broadness of the approach, however, it is wise advising that watershed hydrological plans, together with development policies, must stress fertilizer reductions, as well as act on the livestock farming industry as an inescapable issue to avoid a further deterioration of the present groundwater quality status.</p>
