<p id="Par63" class="p">The examination of the climate change effects on the water balance in distinct aquifers, such as those taken as reference in this contribution, points out that water scarcity, pollution inputs, and management strategies are the key issues on coping with adaptation actions oriented to control nitrate groundwater pollution in the next decades. Water scarcity, controlled by climatic factors, can be counter-balanced by an efficient water use and the use of non-conventional resources, such as reclaimed wastewater. The fact that recharge rates will decrease in western Mediterranean areas will threaten the success of dilution processes. Nevertheless, given present concentrations in groundwater there is no certainty that the overall groundwater nitrate content will likely be enriched as an appropriate magnitude of the nitrogen inputs could counterbalance the effect of diminishing recharge. Therefore, appropriate manure management will thus be sufficient to control nitrate pollution. Conversely, those hydrogeological units additionally recharged by regional, large-scale systems will be more resilient and keep the present dilution rates during the next decades. From a hydrochemical perspective, climate effects on nitrogen mineralization will be variable, although drier conditions might reduce nitrate formation.</p>
