<p id="Par65" class="p">Environmental preservation, especially of groundwater dependent ecosystems (riparian areas and wetlands), is essential to maintain nitrogen assimilation rates. New climate scenarios, as well as higher nitrate content in groundwater, may contribute to transform (and possibly degrade) habitats. Groundwater quality control and environmental monitoring must be maintained with seasonal periodicity to track expected changes. Regional planning, including agricultural, environmental, and water related issues, must be flexible enough to adapt to changes as soon as they become evident. Unplanned actions, left to the landownerâ€™s initiative to satisfy private water needs, will jeopardize the achievement of a sustainable water management plan with irreversible damages. Socio-economic considerations do finally round out the complex decision-making process to deal with climate change and groundwater pollution. Whatever the water balance changes predicted for the next decades, noticeable effects might be noticed soon, and their impacts on groundwater quality are expected to persist in the environment for actually long periods.</p>
