<p id="Par57" class="p">Soil processes, such as nitrogen mineralization, immobilization, and percolation, depend on the soil characteristics including organic matter abundance, pH, microbiological activity, and, specifically, temperature and humidity, being organic matter inversely proportional to temperature (Leirós et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">1999</xref>). As reviewed by Stuart et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2011</xref>), chemical processes under new conditions of soil temperature and, principally, humidity will affect mineralization and leaching: soil moisture appears to be the primary variable affecting soil enzyme activity (Sardans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2008</xref>), and nitrogen mineralization and nitrification are related to temperature and indirectly to rainfall (Rustad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2001</xref>; Emmett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2004</xref>). In its turn, microbial activity is lowest when the soil is either dry or saturated, and increasing summer droughts will reduce mineralization and N and C fluxes whereas increasing summer precipitation could enhance losses (Borken and Matzner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2009</xref>; Dirnböck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>). In summary, complex processes will determine nitrogen mass flow to the aquifer. However, it is clear that such mass flow will not cease in the future decades if continuous fertilization occurs. 
 <italic class="italic">Never can the occurrence of attenuation processes as denitrification, yet active in some aquifers, be considered as an acceptable solution</italic> because it would put aside true management decisions, and it depends on a natural process that might vary spatially and/or temporally under varying hydrogeological dynamics.
