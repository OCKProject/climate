<p id="Par54" class="p">Assuming a recommended rate of fertilization (i.e., manure application twice a year at the established rates of 170 kg N/ha/year in vulnerable agricultural zones and 210 kg N/ha/year in other areas; EU Nitrates Directive), nitrogen mainly leaches from arable soils between summer and winter crops, just after manure application when plant demand is low. Soil accumulated nitrogen mass after decades of continuous high fertilization rates will provide unceasing inputs towards the water table that may increase after intense rainfall events in unconfined aquifers. In this sense, Boy-Roura et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2013b</xref>) point out that nitrate content of the natural springs in Osona was uniform along the whole year, while other physico-chemical parameters varied following a fortnight periodicity monitoring of 13 springs during a year. This fact was interpreted as the effect of accumulated nitrogen, as nitrate in soils and the upper aquifer levels; consequently, the unvarying nitrate content observed in springs can be compared to the concentration reaching the unconfined aquifer and percolating to its deepest levels. Based on groundwater flow and transports simulations in Canada, Paradis et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2016</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2017</xref>) also pointed out that the progressive attainment of steady-state conditions related to present day nitrogen loadings will increase nitrate in groundwater for the next decades and that a changing of load rates will not immediately be noticed in the sampling wells due to the distinct behavior of each hydrogeological formation. In this sense, if rainfall recharge and river inflow are predicted to decrease larger nitrate concentrations might occur as the total nitrate flow mass will depend on the new infiltration rate across the unsaturated zone and the new hydraulic gradient, in its magnitude as well as in direction, within the aquifer. In other words, 
 <italic class="italic">changing hydrogeological dynamics as a response to water balance variations will influence the overall nitrate content and fate in the subsurface, as well as their impact on groundwater dependent ecosystems</italic>. This effect on the nitrate aquifer content, however, must be understood in the context of the mass balance model outcome (Fig.
