<p id="Par36" class="p">Nevertheless, rainfall recharge through infiltration stands as the main input component of nitrate to the subsurface. Direct groundwater recharge effects on nitrate aquifer concentration can be examined using the previously introduced nitrate mass balance model. Based on such gross approach that assumes complete instantaneous mixing, the evolution of nitrate concentration is delineated for a 50-year period. The model assumes that runoff is nil in alluvial plains. Then, rainfall recharge in the Onyar, Garrotxa, Baix Ter, and Baix Fluvi√† alluvial aquifers equals the full R/P ratio derived from the water balance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). For the Osona and Selva basin cases, only a fraction of the available resources defined by R/P would infiltrate, and this fraction is given by the chloride balance, which is assumed constant for future hydrologic scenarios.
