<p id="Par51" class="p">Deep confined or leaky aquifers in fluvio-deltaic plains, such as the Baix Ter and Baix Fluvi√† areas, should be treated differently as their recharge mostly originates in the inland part of these recent sedimentary units. Formed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene eustatic changes, these lower hydrogeological units are in hydraulic contact with the uppermost unconfined aquifer layers along the inland boundary. As expected, such confined/leaky aquifers would not be as resilient to climate change as those in continental locations, as La Selva, Osona, and Garrotxa systems. They will be susceptible to recharge rate reduction and to nitrate enrichment by downward vertical percolation due to held (or increased) exploitation rates.</p>
