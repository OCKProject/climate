<p id="Par50" class="p">The future role of confined aquifers, as presumably more resilient water bodies under changing hydrological conditions, has already been mentioned in this analysis. Besides, nitrate concentrations are usually low in these formations, and they can provide good quality freshwater resources, as those in the Baix Fluvi√† system. However, leaky aquifers, as the Baix Ter area, may present nitrogen under the form of ammonium due to the reduced conditions in depth (Mas-Pla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1998</xref>). Nevertheless, the long-term response of these hydrogeological systems to climate change is uncertain in terms of sustainability, and their quality can be influenced by naturally geological occurring elements, such as arsenic and fluoride as in the Selva basin. Groundwater outflows from range areas to the confined layer of the nearby basins, usually enhanced by fault zones, stand as valuable resources that have to be quantified for each case to avoid over-exploitation (Folch and Mas-Pla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>). Indeed, such flows are of certain relevance, at smaller or greater extent, in most of the selected aquifers; yet only in La Selva basin they entirely balance the intensive groundwater withdrawal that takes place during the irrigation season.
