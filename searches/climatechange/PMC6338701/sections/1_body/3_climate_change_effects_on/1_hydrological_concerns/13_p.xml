<p id="Par46" class="p">A decrease in total recharge implies an increase of the turnover time of groundwater within these hydrogeological systems. Denitrification processes will depend on the subsurface chemical environment, so increasing turnover time might benefit nitrate transformations where subsurface environmental conditions are appropriate. Usual heterotrophic denitrification linked to the occurrence of organic matter and lack of oxygen can certainly be modified. Oxygen solubility will drop at higher temperatures, yet subsurface thermal conditions will eventually remain nearly unchanged at a given depth. Bonnett et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2013</xref>) report that the temperature response of denitrification rate was exponential, yet it also increased under nitrate-rich infiltration flooding conditions. Nevertheless, nitrogen isotopes for the two alluvial aquifers (Baix Ter and Baix Fluvi√†) indicate that, under present conditions, only one out of four samples show some degree of denitrification (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), which suggests that even though conditions turned to be favorable, nitrate degradation would not be a dominant nitrogen loss process.
