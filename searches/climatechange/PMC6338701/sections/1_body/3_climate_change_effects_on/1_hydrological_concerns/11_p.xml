<p id="Par44" class="p">In summary, this mass balance approach can be realistically taken as a broad estimation of what may happen in the future. From a management perspective, it provides an interesting unbiased contribution as it states that managing fertilization stands as the most effective action to insure that climate change will not worsen nitrate concentrations. Despite future scenarios show a general decrease in nitrate for 2050, the sensitivity of the proposed approach suggest that further modeling is needed to more accurately assess the impact of climate change, as well as tailor more specific solutions to nitrate pollution, especially for local smaller aquifer units. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, turnover time and initial concentration stand as the factors that determine the aquifer vulnerability under a constant input load; therefore, the outcome of the model will be more credible when both parameters are strictly estimated for a given hydrogeological unit.
