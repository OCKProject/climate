<p id="Par48" class="p">Exploitation regimes will become a relevant term of the water balance as well. Although among the selected aquifers only the Baix Ter system can be qualified as over-exploited, all of them usually recover their hydraulic head after the irrigation season due to rainfall, stream, and regional flow system contributions, being the later particularly relevant in the Selva and Osona basins. Alluvial aquifers need to be distinguished again because of the influence of well capture zones on the stream discharge. Induced stream infiltration may end up by drying creeks and river reaches, as it presently occurs in the Onyar River and Baix Fluvià River aquifers, representing a cease of low-nitrate content waters into the aquifer and causing severe ecological impacts. Depleted groundwater recharge in future climatic scenarios and similar withdrawal rates will suppose a stronger pressure on each alluvial aquifer system, as turnover times will decrease due to a diminution of the stored water resources. Confined aquifer groundwater resources in fluvio-deltaic formations would be less prone to be affected by climate change, provided that their recharge is associated to regional flow systems, usually with a participation of basement-originated groundwater upward flows as in the Baix Fluvià and Baix Ter aquifers. However, leaky aquifer layers linked to unconfined aquifers that support agricultural activity will present a higher risk of quality resources deterioration.</p>
