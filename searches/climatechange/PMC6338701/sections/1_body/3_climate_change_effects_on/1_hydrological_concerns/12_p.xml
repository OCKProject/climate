<p id="Par45" class="p">Two additional hydrological facts must be conceptually considered in addition to the above discussion. On one hand, decreasing stream runoff will alter the magnitude of surface water recharge. This is relevant in the cases of all analyzed alluvial aquifers. On the other, the overall hydraulic gradient will also be flattened due to a decrease of the inland hydraulic head at the boundaries, at the stream itself or at the coastline. Sea level rise has been measured at a rate of + 3.9 cm/decade, in the Baix Ter shore (Martín-Vide et al.
