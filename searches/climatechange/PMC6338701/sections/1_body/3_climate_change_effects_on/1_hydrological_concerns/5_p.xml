<p id="Par38" class="p">A significant difference is observed between simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, left column). Those evolutions based on the hydrologic conditions (i.e., R/P) set for 2005–2015 and 2050 show a continuous decline towards the equilibrium value that is reached earlier in those aquifers with small turnover times. This is because both 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values are assumed constant, and only the magnitude of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> varies according to climatic predictions affecting 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic> and, consequently, the final equilibrium concentration. Complementarily, a linearly varying change of hydrologic conditions for the next 50 years implies a faster achievement of the nitrate concentration equilibrium value.
