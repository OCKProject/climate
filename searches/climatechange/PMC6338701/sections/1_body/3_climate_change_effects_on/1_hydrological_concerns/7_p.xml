<p id="Par40" class="p">This outcome points out the relevance of input nitrogen loads as a managing term to control nitrate concentration especially under scarcity conditions. In the cases of Osona and Selva basins, conversely, the assumption of instantaneous mixing can hardly be sustained given the regional extent of both hydrogeological systems. Therefore, such a concentration reduction must be considered as a potential, indicative event.</p>
