 <italic class="italic">resource reduction will primarily affect direct groundwater recharge and surface runoff</italic>. Surface runoff is relevant when discussing nitrate in alluvial aquifers since stream-aquifer interaction is the main source of low-nitrate content input to groundwater. This is particularly relevant at loosing stream reaches whether under natural gradient conditions or capture by discharging wells. In this sense, what presently constitute a recharge pole in the alluvial fluvio-deltaic aquifers of the Baix Ter and Baix Fluvià systems will surely reduce its contribution in the near future. If the consequences of diminishing stream discharge in the lower reaches of a river basin are to be examined, a set of outcomes can be enumerated. Namely, a stream discharge reduction implies several hydrological effects: (1) less instream flow, (2) less aquifer recharge in the loosing reaches, (3) a diminution of the water table of the unconfined aquifer, and finally (4) a reduction of the flow discharging back to the river in the gaining stream reaches or across other aquifer boundaries. Notice that those repercussions will worsen in all these areas by the predicted lower rainfall input and because of higher temperatures, more evapotranspiration in crops and forested land, especially during the summer season (Calbó et al.
