<p id="Par39" class="p">The cases of the Onyar and Fluvi√† River alluvial aquifer, and those of Garrotxa and Baix Ter aquifers to a minor extent, offer a more complex response as an initial quick decrease of nitrate concentration is counter-balanced by a later increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, left column). The final concentration, however, always tends to the equilibrium value set by the 2050 conditions. This behavior is controlled by varying annual recharge rates that annually modifies the initial concentration under a constant nitrogen load. The annual modification of the initial concentration produces a shifting of the nitrate evolution trend after the first years of simulation. Despite such a potential response, a tendency to the equilibrium nitrate value set by the hydrological conditions in 2050 must be expected.
