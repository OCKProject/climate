<p id="Par43" class="p">As shown, hydrological aspects as well as fertilization rates control nitrate evolution. A most efficient use of fertilizers must be sought to reduce nitrogen inputs, as well as other ions to groundwater (Menci√≥ et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>). Nevertheless, crop production expectations, and more importantly the utilization of manures and slurries as fertilizers, as a means to reuse a waste product of livestock rising, will require an adjustment between nitrogen applications and environmental nitrogen assimilation/removal rates under future scenarios. Such balance is difficult to estimate, and even more difficult to implement as an environmental policy, yet they have a relevant influence on the final nitrate concentration as shown by the lumped-parameter model. Good agricultural practices devoted to limit nutrient applications will need to be restrictively applied to insure a decrease of nitrate content in groundwater. Efforts to reduce such inputs, even below the legal amounts set by the Nitrates Directive, by promoting alternative treatment of organic fertilizers are paramount to alleviate the expected impact derived from changing hydrological conditions.
