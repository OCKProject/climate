Under these circumstances, the aquifer of the Baix Fluvià and Onyar River reverse their evolution trend to show an increase of nitrate concentration, indicating that total nitrate load is indeed a key factor. The type and magnitude of the nitrate trend is determined by fertilization practices and the use of manure management technologies and policies (Burton and Turner
