<p id="Par34" class="p">As introduced, this paper aims to discuss climate change effects on groundwater quality, taking nitrate as a paradigmatic pollutant, based on the effects of the regional water balance. For the next decades, major changes on land use and groundwater withdrawal rates are not expected. This will be the case for all the regional aquifers herein considered. Consequently, variations driven by natural factors—in particular, those induced by climate changes—and those forced by maintained or increasing human demand will modify the basin water budget. Ecological demand, as the amount of water needed to maintain natural habitats and ecosystem services, will also depend on water availability and on environmental transformation, and it will create a conflict with human interests in a context of water reduction.</p>
