<p id="Par52" class="p">Wastewater reclamation and management rises as a most convenient and reliable local alternative resource. It may not be of direct use in mountain areas, or in the basin headwaters, where the reduction of available resources will affect more the availability to provide downstream discharge than to supply local demand. Outflows from treatment plants dumped into rivers will partially compensate decreasing stream discharge, and despite introducing nutrients into surface water, no major quality changes should be envisaged. Contrarily, water reuse in lowland and coastal areas stands as a mandatory premise for hydrological planning. Alluvial plains with intense agricultural water demand are potentially the first allocation for treated wastewater, at least for specific uses as the total treated water volumes will be by far smaller than the total agricultural demand. Environmental uses, as wetland restoration and maintenance, of reclaimed water are interesting alternatives as well, and they have been successfully used in the preservation of the natural area of the Empordà wetlands, north from the Baix Fluvià area. Both agricultural and environmental uses might benefit from the nutrient content of reclaimed water; yet in excess, they might affect habitat equilibrium and enhance eutrophication. Moreover, treated wastewater applied as irrigation will sum up its nitrogen content with that from manure resulting in an excess load that will concern the final soil and groundwater nitrate concentration.</p>
