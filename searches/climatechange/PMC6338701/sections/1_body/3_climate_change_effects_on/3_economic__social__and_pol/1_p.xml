<p id="Par58" class="p">Beyond hydrological and environmental concerns, climate change issues associated with nitrate pollution have strong economic and social sides. It is obvious that groundwater high nitrate concentrations are related cattle rising (mainly swine), being a crucial development activity in rural areas and for the region’s economy. More specifically, in the case of Catalonia, pork meat production reached a total value of 6.17 kM€ in 2013, being a 33% of this amount derived to foreign exportation (Ramis and Pérez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2016</xref>). Swine manure has been used as fertilizer for several decades and, as seen, high nitrate concentrations are presently found without showing any clear decreasing tendency despite the use of agricultural good practices. Given the importance of this economic sector, it is not plausible that manure production and use will decrease in a medium run and, in consequence, arable lands will be fertilized at its maximum capacity to get rid of manures and slurries. As in any pollution case, input control is a key factor in controlling the spread and evolution of the pollutant, as already discussed for the model results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Alternative nitrate treatment processes should thus be encouraged to be used (Seidel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>), yet at high and undesirable costs that may only be affordable to warrant domestic supply. In the context of climate change, as mentioned, lower recharge in the main agricultural areas located on alluvial aquifers will hamper dilution. In this sense, the problem becomes twofold: water scarcity and pollution.
