<p id="Par60" class="p">Such additional investment can be clearly considered as a climate change adaptation cost, involving allocating groundwater and alternative water resources, such as reclaimed water, and new infrastructure construction. Should actions (and their costs) depend on the sole decisions of well owners, a disorganized modification of the actual exploitation habits is likely to occur, leading to a new scenario far from desired sustainability goals. Therefore,

In this sense, potential actions to execute are (1) substituting well locations for others that will allow a sustainable supply by avoiding over-exploitation (whether by exhausting resources, deteriorating quality, affecting ecosystems, or being economically unfeasible; Custodio

Facing nitrogen input control, implementing good agricultural practices, especially on manure application, implies setting a maximum number of animal heads whose manure can be conveniently assimilated as fertilizer. This may, of course, limit economical profits, but enhance environmental benefits. Applying alternative manure treatment facilities as a means to reduce nitrogen arrival to the environment should then be taken. Irrigator communities (or water userâ€™s associations, where actors are diverse), such as that existing in the Baix Ter area, stand as legal and binding agents necessary to achieve proper adaptation strategies (Garrido and Llamas
