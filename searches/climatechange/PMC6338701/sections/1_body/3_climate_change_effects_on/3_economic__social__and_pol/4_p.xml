<p id="Par61" class="p">Investments need social and political support. From the 
 <italic class="italic">social perspective</italic>, population needs to understand the needs of such actions and the fact that under the new climatic scenarios the cost of good quality water resources will increase. From the 
 <italic class="italic">socio-political side</italic>, education focused to understand the value of a scarce resource should be oriented not only to citizens but also to farmers and, especially, to first-sector investors whose profits are presently based on water resource managing strategies that would be unappropriated for the next decades. The livestock sector has to face it. From the 
 <italic class="italic">political responsibility</italic>, a commitment is needed to impulse directives and measures focused on water resources planning that recognize the urgency for actions. The water balance approach used to discuss the effects of climate change on the quality of groundwater resources indicates that the “nitrate problem” may become even worse if the no-action attitude prevails. Active political involvement is paramount to force action and to adjust government as well as private responsibilities on preserving groundwater quality resources, explicitly recognizing the environmental duty of private investors and farm owners that are relevant actors on the proper setting of management solutions.
