<p id="Par8" class="p">A paradigmatic study on the impact of climate change on future nitrate concentrations in groundwater of the UK by Stuart et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2011</xref>) summarizes potential changes on the hydrological processes that will affect nitrate concentration using a source–pathway–receptor framework. These authors concentrate on three main questions to understand the nature of climate change impact on groundwater nitrate concentrations:
