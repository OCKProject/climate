<p id="Par3" class="p">Despite all these efforts, present nitrate concentrations in groundwater reflect the impact of decades of nitrogen inputs and its persistence in the subsurface (e.g., Paradis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2017</xref>). In many aquifers, dilution has been one of the major processes that have diminished nitrate concentration (Altman and Parizek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1995</xref>; Hoffman and Canace 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2004</xref>). Mixing between polluted water resources and less-polluted groundwater effectively reduces this environmental pressure. In the subsurface, natural and pumping induced mixing from different aquifer levels also has a dilution effect. In particular, mixing in boreholes due to the exploitation of several aquifer levels produces dilution by averaging nitrate mass fluxes, which in many cases is not enough to reduce nitrate concentration below the drinking standard values. However, mixing cannot be understood as a complete positive effect, as non-polluted groundwater resources are also at risk to reduce their quality. In intensively exploited aquifers, well fields induce an overall mixing process that affects the general quality of the regional subsurface resources.
