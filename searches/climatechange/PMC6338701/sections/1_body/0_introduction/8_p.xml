<p id="Par12" class="p">Assuming that few changes will occur on agricultural activities in the next decades to 2050 (as discussed hereafter), questions ii and iii are those of most interest, and they will be addressed in this study using a water balance approach. We assume that the principal nitrogen input will continue to derive from fertilization, whether using organic manure or slurry, chemical fertilizers, and/or sewage slurries, and this should remain alike for the next decades. In many regions, such as Catalonia, the use of livestock manure as fertilizer will stay as the main nitrogen source used in crops as a means to reuse this by-product. At a regional level, best management practices are one of the driving factors to reduce nitrate from agricultural origin in groundwater. Point sources inputs of domestic and industrial origin are also relevant (Ducharne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2007</xref>), yet these are not relevant as poles of groundwater nitrate pollution in the studied aquifers.
