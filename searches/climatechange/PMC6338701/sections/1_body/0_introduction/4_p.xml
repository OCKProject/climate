<p id="Par5" class="p">The goal of this contribution is to explore the effects of global change—that is, those derived from climate variations and human pressures—upon the fate and persistence of nitrate in groundwater at a regional scale and in the long run. It is our belief that such a comprehensive analysis supports the worth of future actions on nitrate management to ensure the sustainability of water resources. To conduct such objective, a water balance approach, which conceptually analyzes the variation that each component of the hydrological cycle will experience under new climatic scenarios and similar water uses, is used to address the effect of climate change on the groundwater nitrate content. Hydrological, environmental, and socio-political concerns are discussed so distinct perspectives are considered in the evaluation of such interdisciplinary issue (Holman
