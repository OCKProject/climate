<p id="Par4" class="p">Dilution, at the end, relies on the input of non-polluted water fluxes. Assuming that the aquifer has such inputs (i.e., through rainfall, stream and/or mountain front recharges), a decrease on the amount of “clean” fluxes definitely reduces the mixing capacity and, therefore, the dilution effect. In many regions on Earth, and in particular in western Mediterranean areas, climate change will represent a shift towards drier conditions (e.g., IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2014</xref>), and consequently a diminution of the aquifer dilution capacity in relation to its aquifer turnover or mean residence time (Kazemi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2006</xref>). Since hydrogeological resources are highly influenced by human pressures, the effect of climate change upon groundwater bodies must be considered from distinct perspectives. Both climate and human pressures define global change aspects. Such approach can be focused to investigate the persistence of nitrate in groundwater by considering all the processes that, once affected by global change, will modify the tendency of nitrate concentrations and that of groundwater quality.
