<p id="Par2" class="p">Groundwater nitrate pollution is a ubiquitous worldwide problem that has been in the managers’ as well in the researchers’ agenda for decades (e.g., Galloway et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2008</xref>; Sutton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rosenstock et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2014</xref>). Multiple efforts have been devoted to improve agricultural practices so nitrogen leaching due to fertilization is minimized (Cameron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>; Beaudoin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2005</xref>), to track its movement through the unsaturated zone and its migration beneath the water table (Baram et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2017</xref>; Dimitriou and Moussoulis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2010</xref>; Molénat and Gascuel-Odoux 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2002</xref>), to analyze biogeochemical processes so denitrification rates can be identified and induced aquifer clean-up be subsequently applied to remove nitrate from groundwater (Böhlke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2002</xref>; Rivett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2008</xref>), and, finally, to treat polluted groundwater once withdrawn from the aquifer so its nitrate content is reduced before entering the water supply systems (Seidel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>). Moreover, legislation has been issued to cope with these problems and oblige those who are responsible to reduce such impact and/or face legal prosecution (i.e., the Nitrates Directive, 1991/676/EEC; and the Water Framework Directive, 2000/60/EEC).
