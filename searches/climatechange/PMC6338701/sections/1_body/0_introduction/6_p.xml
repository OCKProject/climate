<p id="Par7" class="p">In this contribution, we use these selected aquifers in Catalonia as paradigmatic cases to analyze the effect of climate change on nitrate concentration for a western Mediterranean climatic setting (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). For each aquifer, their hydrogeological characteristics, the extent of the pollution and denitrification processes, the rate of groundwater exploitation and its final use, as well as the occurrence of alternative water resources for human uses. Lastly, the pressures upon groundwater quality (e.g., fertilization, wastewater infiltration) are described as a basis to illustrate potential hydrologic behaviors under future hydrologic scenarios (Mas-Pla

This analysis provides thus a qualitative evaluation for the future availability of suitable groundwater resources in these aquifers on the light of the expected water reduction related to global change, as defined by the climatic scenarios for the western Mediterranean area and land use changes.
