<p class="p">Under current conditions, the state has an average Hantavirus infection risk of 1.3%, with 6% of the municipalities classified as high risk (HCPS â‰¥ 5%). Hantavirus infection risk increases under all scenarios evaluated (0.25% to 0.37%) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005705.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Sugarcane expansion is the scenario that predicted the smallest increase in Hantavirus risk, with a 0.25% increase on average. The most pronounced changes are expected to occur in the west and mid-west parts of the state where almost all municipalities exhibit an increase of 1.5% in HCPS infection risk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005705.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>). Also, sugarcane scenario will lead to a risk greater than 5% for HCPS for about 6.6% of all municipalities (43 municipalities).
