<p class="p">When combining climate change scenarios and sugarcane expansion, the average increase and the maximum HCPS risk for the state is the same as under the climate change scenarios alone (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), showing that there is no additional effects between temperature and sugarcane. However, the increase in Hantavirus risk became more homogeneous throughout the state when considering the combined sugarcane-climate change (
