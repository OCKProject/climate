<p class="p">Projected temperature anomalies for both climate change scenarios predicted similar average increases of HCPS in the state (0.35% for RCP4.5 and 0.37% for RCP8.5), with larger increases concentrated in the northeast region, but with RCP4.5 predicting smaller increases than RCP8.5 (

Moreover, there is a significant increase in the risk of infection for some municipalities that already had a high risk, especially in the mid-west region, with HCPS risk reaching 52.3% in RCP4.5 and 52.7% in RCP8.5. Under the RCP4.5 scenario there were 42 municipalities (~6.5% of the state) with a HCPS risk greater than 5%, while under the RCP8.5 scenario there were 44 municipalities (~6.9% of the state). The HCPS risk simulated using the temperature anomalies ± 1 standard deviation showed that the uncertainty of models simulations is small, and that disease risk is similar for all three experiments (mean temperature anomalies, mean temperature anomalies + 1 standard deviation and mean temperature anomalies—1standard deviation). Therefore, our confidence interval of predictions due to temperature change analysis is narrow, showing similar and consistent trends (
