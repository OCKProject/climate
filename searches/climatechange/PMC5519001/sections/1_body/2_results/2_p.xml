<p class="p">Considering climate change scenarios, there is a general consensus among the 32 models evaluated, for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, in the direction of the projected temperature change for the state of SÃ£o Paulo, with both experiments presenting increases. Also, RCP8.5 presents a smaller variation and lower standard deviation between the 32 models analyzed than RCP4.5 models, especially from 2013 to 2050 (
