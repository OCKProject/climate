<p class="p">The relatively low magnitude of the effect of climate change on HCPS risk in our study maybe explained by the fact that temperature anomalies, until 2050, can be considered small and similar for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with larger increases being observed only after 2050. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that increases in temperature anomalies lead to increase in HCPS risk, though small, in all the 645 municipalities of the state of SÃ£o Paulo. Therefore, higher increases for disease risk are expected after 2050 if carbon emissions are not controlled and climate change mitigation actions are not successful.</p>
