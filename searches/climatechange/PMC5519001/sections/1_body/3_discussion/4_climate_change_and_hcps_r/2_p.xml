<p class="p">There is a lack of studies involving reservoir rodent species and Hantavirus related to HCPS and climate variables, but for HFRS, mild temperatures (10–25°C) are most favorable for breeding of reservoirs rodents [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] and for the time the virus remains infectious in the environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Increases in temperature lead to greater aerosolization of the virus and higher rates of inhalation by both humans and rodents [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. In this way, increases in temperature may have a positive effect on reservoir rodent abundance and virus survival and aerosolization until reaching a certain threshold (around 40°0°CC) from where temperature will exert a negative effect.
