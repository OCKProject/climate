<p class="p">Our results confirmed previous studies showing that increases in the amount of sugarcane can augment HCPS risk [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Our scenario predicted an increase in ~6,000 ha of land occupied with sugarcane on average, for both the Cerrado and Atlantic forest regions, until 2050, forecasting increases of ~15% in HCPS risk. This expansion can be considered small, since the area planted with sugarcane in the state has tripled from 1990 to 2010, increasing from 3,000 to 9,000 ha on average for the entire state [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. Over this same time period HCPS risk in the state has also increased almost four times (382%) from 0.34 to 1.3%. Therefore, the increase in disease risk, predicted by our model and according to the expansion of sugarcane, is concordant with the historical increase in risk experienced from 1993 to 2012.
