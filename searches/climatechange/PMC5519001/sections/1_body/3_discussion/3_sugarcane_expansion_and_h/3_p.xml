 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Sugarcane plantations have cooler temperatures and more moisture than pasture and other crops, being micro-climatically more similar to areas of natural vegetation near to the soil level [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. This microclimate changes may contribute to the increase in HCPS risk, since it makes sugarcane an even better habitat for rodents. This climate aspect can also affect the indirect path of transmission, extending the time the virus remains infectious in this environment and augmenting HCPS risk, since virus inactivation happens only in dry conditions and above 37Â°C [
