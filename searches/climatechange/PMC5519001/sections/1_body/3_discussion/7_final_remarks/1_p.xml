<p class="p">Our scenarios of future sugarcane expansion and climate change RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 predicted a low but significant increase in HCPS risk in the state of SÃ£o Paulo by 2050. Despite the lack of additive effects of sugarcane and climate in HCPS risk, we suggest that prevention and mitigation actions should focus on land use planning and forest restoration programs, and by concentrating healthcare effort in areas that are predicted to be at higher HCPS risk and have a high variation in the confidence interval.</p>
