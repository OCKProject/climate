<p class="p">To better explore the underlying mechanisms of the observed pattern, we suggest future studies should test the effects of sugarcane production, temperature, and moisture on reservoir rodent population dynamics and on virus survival and aerosolization. Understanding those relationships is crucial to better understand HCPS transmission dynamics in different environments and situations, which is important for the effective design of preventive health strategies.</p>
