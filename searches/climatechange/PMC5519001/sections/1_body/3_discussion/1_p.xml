<p class="p">In accordance to our predictions, sugarcane expansion and rising temperature will lead to increases in HCPS risk but with relatively weak effects on average. Our results suggest that climate change effects will be more severe than those from sugarcane expansion, and surprisingly, there was no evidence of additive effects of sugarcane and climate on HCPS risk for the state.</p>
