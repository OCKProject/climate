<p class="p">Individual evaluation of climate and sugarcane could have resulted in a better understanding of the individual contributions of each factor on disease risk. However, evaluating these scenarios together is a more realistic approach, given that they will occur and act together. Sugarcane expansion and temperature anomalies together showed no additionality, predicting the same average increase in HCPS risk when compared to climate change scenarios alone. This may have happened because there are multiple mechanisms through which temperature influences HCPS risk, some of which overlaps sugarcane mechanisms (i.e., effect on rodent densities). Particularly, even in conditions where rodent abundances and prevalence are high, if temperature conditions are not ideal for virus survival and aerosolization, transmission to humans will not occur. Therefore, the ability of the virus to survive outside the host is critical for the transmission within rodent populations and to humans, with temperature being one of the determining factors of this survival. This effect, may have contributed to the lack of additionality between temperature and sugarcane, since sugarcane effects will only occur when temperature conditions are also adequate.</p>
