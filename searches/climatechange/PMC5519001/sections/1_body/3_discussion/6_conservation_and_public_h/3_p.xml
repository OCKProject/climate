<p class="p">Public health costs will also increase under the expected increase in temperature and sugarcane expansion. At least part of these costs should be factored into sugarcane production, including expenditures associated with rodent control, education and preventive campaigns targeting how to avoid virus inhalation and contact with infected rodents excreta. These control measures are likely to yield additional benefits since rodents are considered major pests of this crop [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. States and municipalities considering sugarcane expansion should also plan for costs involved with educational campaigns and preventive measures, for example, educating workers and residents from rural areas about how to avoid Hantavirus inhalation and contact with infect rodents excreta. This could be crucial to avoid disease propagation to places where HCPS risk is currently low or absent. This type of information should be incorporated into the costs of land use management. Sugarcane expansion can provide a solution to one specific problem, such as supplying the oil market, but can on the other hand create a human health problem by increasing risks of acquiring HCPS.
