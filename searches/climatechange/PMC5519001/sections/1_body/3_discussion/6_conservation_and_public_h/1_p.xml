<p class="p">Land cover and land use change are at the origin of the outbreaks of Hantavirus and can also be an important component to reduce or mitigate its spread. Given that temperature increase will lead to increases in HCPS risk, forest restoration can be an alternative to attenuate the effects of higher temperature on HCPS risk for three main reasons. First, forest regrowth, especially in tropical regions, can sequester atmospheric carbon, absorbing about 30% of all CO

Third, increasing forest cover could also reduce HCPS risk arising from sugarcane expansion, since it would lead to increased suitable habitat for habitat specialist species, leading to a more diverse community, with decreased abundance of habitat generalist species [
