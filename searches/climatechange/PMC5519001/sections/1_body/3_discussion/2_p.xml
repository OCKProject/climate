<p class="p">The effects of sugarcane expansion and temperature anomalies on HCPS risk were smaller than initially expected, which may have occurred because transmission to humans is complex and involves a number of factors that are not yet fully understood, especially in the tropics. Hantavirus infection rates and prevalence in rodent populations are generally low [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Transmission increases in density-dependent fashion with greater intraspecific encounter rates and virus transmission at high rodent densities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Consequently, the virus load in the environment and the human risk of acquiring HCPS also increases at high rodent densities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. However, high abundances of reservoirs alone do not guarantee that humans will become infected. To acquire HCPS, human exposure to infected rodents is also necessary, with disease transmission resulting from a combination of human behaviors (i.e., inadequate storage of grains and lack of protective measures) and, density and prevalence of reservoirs. Climate also affects virus survival and aerosolization in the environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Disease transmission to humans requires that these four main factors interact: an infected rodent; a certain abundance of reservoir rodents to proliferate the infection throughout the rodent population (in which prevalence is generally low); suitable climatic conditions in order to maintain the virus in the environment and allow its aerosolization, and a susceptible human population. Due to these complex dynamics, HCPS transmission to humans is difficult and can be considered as a rare event, with a low number of cases reported each year. However, this increase is extremely relevant given the high lethality rate of the HCPS, which is around 50% in the state.
