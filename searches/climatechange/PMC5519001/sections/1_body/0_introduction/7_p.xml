<p class="p">The combined consequences of bio-energy expansion and climate variability and change on Hantavirus infection risk remain unexamined. Understanding how these factors impact infectious disease risk is essential to fully evaluate the actual costs of the biofuel programs and is critical for timely and efficient planning of operational control programs. In this paper we analyze how sugarcane expansion and temperature changes under two climate scenarios can potentially influence HCPS risk in the state of SÃ£o Paulo by 2050. To do so, we relied on a baseline model we previously developed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which evaluated the effects of landscape, climate and social predictors, including historical climate and sugarcane as predictor variables, on Hantavirus risk between 1993 and 2012. In this paper, we used climate and sugarcane data derived from various scenarios (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" class="xref">methods</xref> section) to test the independent and combined effect of these two factors on HCPS risk. We hypothesize that HCPS incidence will show an increase under all scenarios because both changes in climate and sugarcane expansion are expected to increase HCPS risk through their positive effects on rodent abundance and virus survival and aerosolization, and that their combined effect can exacerbate their individual impacts.
