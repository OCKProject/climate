<p class="p">We tested models of raw HPS incidence as well as model residuals for spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>. We used the spatial contiguity matrix based on the Queen´s case neighborhood relation and treated each year separately. This test is commonly used and accepted as a fair evaluation of spatial autocorrelation and dependence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. For all models and most years, we found no spatial autocorrelation, justifying the use of a non-spatial model.
