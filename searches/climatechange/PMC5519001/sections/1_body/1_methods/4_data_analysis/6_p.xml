<p class="p">To obtain a clear view of the probability of change in Hantavirus risk, we created a map with the change in infection risk for each scenario that was calculated using the difference between the current Hantavirus risk and the predicted risk for each scenario. We also used model simulations to generate a map of Hantavirus infection risk for the State of São Paulo for each scenario, where Hantavirus infection risk is classified as small (&lt;5%), medium (≥5 and ≤10%), high (≥10 and ≤ 20%) and extremely high (≥20%). We considered that a municipality with a risk higher than 5% should be a target for preventive measures due to the high disease lethality (maps are shown in supplementary material—
