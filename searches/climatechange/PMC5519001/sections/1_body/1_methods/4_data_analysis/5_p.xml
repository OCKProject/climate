<p class="p">To estimate the predicted probability of HCPS infection under the five future scenarios we used the parameter estimates from the baseline model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and used sugarcane and climate data derived for each scenario. We made the simplifying assumption that the biological relationships governing disease transmission would remain largely unchanged over the estimation period. Uncertainty was measured using lower and upper limits of risk estimates for each scenario, derived from the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the baseline model parameters for sugarcane and temperatures. Results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005705.s004" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005705.s005" class="xref">S4</xref> Figs. The covariates percent of native vegetation cover, number of patches, total annual precipitation, human development index, and people at risk were assumed to be the same as the covariates from the previous year, available from the baseline model (year of 2012), and were kept constant for the predictions. These are reasonable assumptions considering that trends of urban-rural migration in SÃ£o Paulo are constant [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], deforestation has been drastically reduced in the state [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and precipitation is not relevant for HCPS risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Despite the increase in sugarcane mechanization, manual harvest is still necessary and present in some parts of the process [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Additionally, skilled workers are replacing unskilled workers, while temporary workers are still being hired at the same rates as before [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The number of people employed in sugarcane areas is not diminishing with sugarcane mechanization.
