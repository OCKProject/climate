<p class="p">HCPS infection risk was predicted using a Bernoulli distribution and the model (baseline model) contained 7 predictor variables as fixed covariates: proportion of sugarcane, proportion of native vegetation cover, density of native vegetation patches, HDI, mean annual temperature (Â°C), total annual precipitation (mm), and rural male population &gt;14 years old [
