<p class="p">We used the São Paulo state forest inventory maps (i.e. habitat cover classification map—

Native vegetation cover data includes the two biomes of the state, the Atlantic forest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] and the Cerrado [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. We performed the landscape analyses in ArcGis 10.0 and Fragstats 4.2. To match this information with available disease data, we used metrics extracted from the 2000 native vegetation cover map as covariates for the incidence model for 1993–2001, and metrics extracted from the 2010 map as covariates for the 2002–2012 period.
