<p class="p">We collected HCPS incidence data (number of HCPS cases per year) at the municipality level and therefore considered the 645 municipalities that compose the state as our sampling units (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005705.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The number of reported annual HCPS cases in each municipality for the period between 1993 and 2012 is available from the Center for Epidemiological Surveillance of the State of São Paulo—CVE-SP (1993–2012), and the Health Portal SUS:

The CVE-SP compiles this information because Hantavirus infection requires mandatory notification to the local health authorities in Brazil. The data is provided by every hospital in the state. CVE-SP data include only cases recorded with clinical symptoms that have been confirmed by laboratory analysis (antibody positive). Since the majority of cases were zeroes (98.71%) or ones (1.06%), we transformed the data into a binary variable, presence/absence of HCPS per year and per municipality.
