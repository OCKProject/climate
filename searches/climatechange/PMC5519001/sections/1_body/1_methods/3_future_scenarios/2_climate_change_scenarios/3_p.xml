<p class="p">A previous study showed that only temperature (and not precipitation) had a significant effect on Hantavirus infection risk in São Paulo [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005705.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Thus, we calculated annual and surface temperature (ts) averaged over the state of São Paulo using the two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and historical experiments. Historical experiments are necessary to calculate temperature anomalies (i.e., calculated with respect to each model´s climatology of the current climate), relative to each model of climate change, being used as baseline. Therefore, 32 general circulation models (GCMs), common to all three experiments (historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), were obtained from the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Ocean and Climate Physics Data Library (

The historical experiment time-series ends in 2005 in most models. Thus, a 30-year climatology was calculated for the period 1976 to 2005 to best match the observational data (20 years—1993–2012) whereas the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 extends from 2006 to 2050. Although climate-change projections are increasing in spatial resolution, they are still not appropriate for analyzing disease patterns at scales smaller than an area of 250 x 250 km [
