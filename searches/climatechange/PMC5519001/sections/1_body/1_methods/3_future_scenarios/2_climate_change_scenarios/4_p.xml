<p class="p">Temperature anomalies for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were calculated individually for each model as the difference between the future temperature predicted and the mean temperature during the 1976–2005 period of the historical experiment. We then calculated the average anomalies of all 32 models, for each scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and included this value, in our predictions. Therefore, we ended up with one average of temperature anomalies between 2013 and 2050 of 32 models for the RCP4.5 scenario and one average of temperature anomalies of 32 models for the RCP8.5 scenario, which we used to simulate Hantavirus infection risk from 2013 to 2050. We present the results of our simulated HCPS risk due to mid-century changes in temperature for the period 2040–2050, to diminish uncertainties in climate analysis.</p>
