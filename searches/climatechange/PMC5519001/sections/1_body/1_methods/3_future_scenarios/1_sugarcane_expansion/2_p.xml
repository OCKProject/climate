<p class="p">Percentages of suitable and unsuitable areas for sugarcane in 2012 (the last year of our baseline model) for each municipality were extracted from the AZA map using ArcGis 10.0 and Fragstats 4.2. Percentages of pasture and sugarcane, for each municipality, were extracted from the agricultural census of the Institute of Agricultural Economics. To calculate the proportion of sugarcane expansion of the last ten years, we extracted the percentage of sugarcane for each municipality from the agricultural census of the Institute of Agricultural Economics, for the years 2000 and 2010. The difference between these two percentages was considered as the 10-year sugarcane expansion, and used as the maximum value (in percentage) of expansion for each municipality. This expansion was projected respecting the amount of suitable areas according the AZA determination and the amount of pasture, and therefore, it did not always reach the maximum value.</p>
