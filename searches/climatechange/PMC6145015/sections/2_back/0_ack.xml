 <p class="p">We thank all of the 1,500 counters belonging to more than 300 organizations who kindly helped with counting night cormorant roosts during the 13 national censuses in France. We wish to thank Annie Buchwalter for linguistic improvements of the manuscript. The last nine national censuses were supported by the French Ministry of Ecology. The present study was supported by a grant from the SESLG. Climate data were provided by Météo‐France.</p>
