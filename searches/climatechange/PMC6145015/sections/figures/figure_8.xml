  <p class="p">Historical record of the occupancy of each of the 95 French departments from 1983 to 2015. The color used for the first national census in 1983 shows the presence of wintering cormorants at this date; it remains the same (similarly to the other colors of the left column in the legend) for the following censuses as long as cormorant numbers kept increasing. The colors of the right column were used when the numbers decreased by &gt;10% (and remained the same for the following censuses as long as cormorant numbers kept decreasing). The sign “=” was used when numbers leveled off (±10%). A following increase or decrease &gt;10% after such a leveling off is shown by a color change in the corresponding year</p>
