<p class="p">When normality was not present, we used nonparametric tests. The role of temperature on the mean size of the wintering population of cormorants in January was calculated by comparing the average number of wintering cormorants in each department over the 13 censuses with the average temperature in January in each department (Spearman test, climate data from Météo France). The role of temperature in the chronology of the geographical conquest of France by wintering cormorants was tested by classifying the date of appearance of the first night roost in each department into six classes (up to 1983, 1989, 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2001), using ANOVA for independent series and then grouping 1989 and 1992 together. The role of competition for optimal feeding areas in the chronology of occupancy of the departments was tested using their water surface using Carthage database, version 2013. Optimal cormorant feeding areas are large open waters such as coastal lagoons, lakes, large rivers, and estuaries, while the secondary web of rivers only represents suboptimal feeding areas, as regards the fish stock and safety from humans generally present on the banks (Marion,

 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). According to the theory of competition among animals (Krebs &amp; Davis, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0804" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>), suboptimal areas are progressively used only after saturation of optimal feeding areas (Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997b</xref>). So we compared the correlations between the numbers of cormorants in each department and the water surface area, small rivers &lt;50 m wide (suboptimal areas) excluded, over the successive national censuses. A decreasing correlation with time meant an increasing buffer effect of dominated birds rejected toward the suboptimal areas, owing to increasing competition and saturation in optimal areas. The precise distribution of cormorants in the feeding areas in the daytime was not available, so we did not directly correlate the number of cormorants with the types of feeding areas.
