<p class="p">Night roosts are generally occupied every year (which facilitates monitoring) except when strong disturbances occur, and most of them gather tens to hundreds of noisy cormorants. Night roosts with less than 10 birds are very rare. To discover the few new night roosts during each national census, counters followed the direction of straight flights of cormorants that flew directly to their night roost, and/or inspected the banks of rivers, lakes or sea coasts. Over 13 winters (named from each January) from 1983 to 2015, national censuses of all the night roosts were coordinated (by Loïc Marion, excepted in 1983 by Eric Pasquet) in the evening or more rarely early in the morning, with a network of counters who knew the local distribution of roosts very well. The roosts were counted simultaneously in mid‐January, when migration movements are usually minor. Such counts of night roosts were chosen to avoid underestimation (up to 50%, Marion,

However, daytime counts were used in a few rare cases when night roosts were not counted because there were not enough counters or weather was foggy. When neither night nor daytime data were available in a given year, night roosts sizes were estimated by comparing numbers with those of neighboring roosts or neighboring “departments” (administrative French districts) between two successive national censuses. Such estimates only represented 0.5% to 2.87% of the national number of wintering cormorants (Marion,
