<p class="p">We investigated the global relations between cormorant numbers according to years, departments, water surface areas, and annual temperature in January using Generalized Mixed Effect Models (GLMs, R package “lme4”). More precisely, GLMs assuming Poisson's distribution were used to test if cormorant numbers were related to water surface area (fixed effect), temperature (fixed effect), year (fixed effect), and department (random effect). We then calculated the conditional and marginal pseudo‐
