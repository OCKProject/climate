<p class="p">Such a decrease corresponded to a regular decrease of the largest roosts: in 1989, 45.45% of the roosts harbored between 201 and &gt;1,600 cormorants, vs. only 8.49% in 2015, while the biggest roosts had practically disappeared (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). These decreases benefited to small roosts (&lt;51 individuals) which reached 53.47% of the roosts in 2015 vs. 28.57% in 1989, and to middle‐sized roosts (51–100 individuals) that reached 20.50% in 2015 vs. 13% in 1989.
