GLMs (Models 2 to 7) showed that (a) year, (b) department, (c) water surface area, and (d) temperature (in decreasing order) mainly explained the size of the populations. Models 5‐6‐7 showed that year, wetland surface area, and temperature explained 37.84%, 13.68%, and 0.44% of the variance, respectively.
