<p class="p">Populations dramatically decreased during the 2009 cold wave, when the distribution of declining or stabilized departments practically concerned the whole country except the northwestern part, with again increasing heterogeneity in dynamics among departments (increase versus decrease &gt;10% and vice versa). This heterogeneity was noted only in 3.12% of the departments between two successive censuses until 1992, in 43.74% of them between 1997 and 2007, and in 49.47% of them between 2009 and 2015. Only one department (Nord) kept the same dynamics since its first occupancy, with a continuous increase in the number of cormorants.</p>
