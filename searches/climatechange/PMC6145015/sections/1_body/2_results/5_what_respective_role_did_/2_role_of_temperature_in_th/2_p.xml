<p class="p">The cold wave of the 1997 winter caused the first important change in the dynamics of numbers in France after 14 years of increasing numbers (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>): the number of cormorants decreased in 30 departments and leveled off in 5, most of them in the northwest and southeast areas, even before the total conquest of the country (nine departments still remained unoccupied, essentially in the coldest northeast area).The situation was partly similar during the 2003 cold wave, but there was only one unoccupied department, and above all the population dynamics became geographically much more complex than in 1997, with opposite dynamics in most of the neighboring departments instead of regional tendencies as observed previously.
