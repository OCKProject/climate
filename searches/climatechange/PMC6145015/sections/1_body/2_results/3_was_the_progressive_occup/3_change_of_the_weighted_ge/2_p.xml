<p class="p">The weighted centroid of the wintering population in January shifted by 83 km (=2.60 km/year) in a NNE direction between 1983 (45°881N/2°213E) and 2015 (46°609N/2°466E), with a significant linear change between latitude and years (latitude N = 0.01414*year + 18.06, 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; 0.0036,

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 55.3%), despite an abnormal decrease of the latitude in 2013 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). There was a strong correlation between the latitudinal weighted centroid and the number of wintering cormorants in January, 2013 excluded (Spearman 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.811 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.007). However, when 2013 was included, it was not valid any more (Spearman 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.544,
