<p class="p">In France, wintering cormorants mainly originated from northern European countries (continental subspecies from The Netherlands and Baltic countries, and marine subspecies from the UK, Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Strangely enough, they conquered France preferentially via the more distant wintering areas, that is, the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), despite the cost of flight. The English Channel was used by less than 10% of the birds until 2007. However, the wintering population on the Atlantic coast plummeted in 1997 (−51%), followed by a slow partial increase until 2003 and a leveling off around 11,000 birds until 2009, and a low increase again between 2011 and 2015 up to 14,200 birds. The Mediterranean coast (essentially lagoons) was also rapidly saturated in 1999 with around 12,000 birds, yet it sustained surprising increases in 2013 (18,265 birds) and 2015 (14,471 birds). These saturated pioneer areas were offset by a very strong increase in inland areas, which grew from 28% of the national population in 1983 to 68% in 1999, starting by the Rhône and Loire rivers that harbored one night roost every 40 km (Figure
