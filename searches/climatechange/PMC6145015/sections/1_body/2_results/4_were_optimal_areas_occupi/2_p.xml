<p class="p">At a large scale (three coastal areas and the inland area), the inland area was mainly occupied after the saturation of the south and west sea‐coasts (optimal areas) and then the northern coast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). At a more detailed scale, the strategy of occupancy of the 15 main watersheds between 1983 and 2015 was similar (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). There was a rapid conquest of the areas representing the main eastern migration route mainly used by Baltic birds (n°6‐11‐12), and Brittany (n°2) representing the western migration route used by birds from The NL and the UK. All these populations reached their peak of numbers as early as 1992 and then declined, sometimes sharply (n°2‐11‐12‐15). The 1992 peak was also recorded in areas n°3, 7, and 13, followed by a decrease in 1997 and a subsequent increase. By contrast, the rapid transfer of birds from the declining areas or the additional migrating birds in France mainly concerned areas n°4 until 1999, n°9 and 14 until 2001, n°5 until 2003, n°8 until 2005, n°3 until 2007, n°10 until 2013, and more slowly and more progressively n°1 until 2015. The 2009 cold wave decreased the numbers of cormorants in all areas except n°2 and 14, with a higher impact in areas located in eastern and central France, but also in Normandy. Independently of normal annual fluctuations, there was a sharp contrast between (a) areas where the numbers of wintering cormorants durably leveled off after the decrease that followed the 1990s peak in numbers (n°2‐4‐6‐11‐12), and (b) areas where the numbers of wintering cormorants regularly decreased (n°5‐8‐9), or conversely (c) those in which the numbers regularly increased (n°7‐10‐13‐14 and above all n°1 = Nord‐Picardie, which was first avoided but finally represented the third most occupied area in France).
