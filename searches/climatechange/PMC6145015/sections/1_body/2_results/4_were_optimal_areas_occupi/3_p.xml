Forty‐two departments were already occupied in 1983, while 24 new ones were occupied in 1989 and 9 in 1992, notably inland departments in southeastern and northeastern France, yet with still 10 of them unoccupied in that latter area in 1992 out of the 15 unoccupied ones at the national level. We analyzed the respective role of temperature and wetland areas at this geographical scale.
