<p class="p">The case of wintering cormorants shows that within a few decades protection can logically induce an increase in the population that generates increasing competition for optimal feeding areas. The impact of the climate change could differently affect the dynamics and distribution of populations according to the saturation of optimal habitats. If there is a geographical northsouth gradient of optimal–suboptimal habitats, competition among individuals may induce a similar or even a higher northern range shift than the climate change does, or induce an opposite shift with differences between breeding and wintering populations. Both factors (saturation/climate) should be studied simultaneously from long‐term, large‐scale databases to avoid misinterpretations about the impact of the climate change. Competition between geographical origins, including subspecies, could also induce changes in migration routes and cause competition to shift elsewhere. The heterogeneity of local situations (increasing vs. decreasing trends in the numbers of individuals) strongly increased with the global increase in the population and with the degree of saturation of habitats over time. The effect of the climate (cold waves) on population size could be higher in saturated populations, but contributed marginally to the distribution of cormorant over the three 1980–2010 decades. The example of the great cormorant could be extended to many other bird species protected in the 1970s or 1980s by the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act Protected Species or the European Union Bird Directive. For these bird species, range shifts have mostly been only attributed to the climate change in the literature without taking into account competition due to the saturation of usual wintering or breeding areas.</p>
