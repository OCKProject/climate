<p class="p">Additionally, the increasing numbers of protected areas (hunting‐free reserves) in France over the study period did not explain the increase in the wintering population of cormorant, although it did so for some species (Madsen &amp; Fox, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Protected areas played a minor role in the distribution of winter roosts, and their role was more marked in breeding colonies (Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0805" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>). A complementary analysis will be needed about fish resources to assess the carrying capacity of the country (Marion, in prep.), to try and explain why the level of 100,000 cormorants has been (momentarily?) overrun since 2013. The shooting of cormorants in France, from 5.55% of the wintering population (in January) in 1996 to 43.51% in 2013, had no effect on the dynamics of the wintering populations from winter to winter at the department scale (Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>; Marion, in prep.). The same pattern occurred in Bavaria (Keller &amp; Lanz, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), England (Chamberlain, Austin, Newson, Johnston, &amp; Burton, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and Denmark (Bregnballe, Hyldgaard, Clausen, &amp; Carss, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>): shot cormorants were rapidly replaced, probably mainly by young birds because adults tend to go back to the same wintering sites (Reymond &amp; Zuchuat, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Yésou, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>).
