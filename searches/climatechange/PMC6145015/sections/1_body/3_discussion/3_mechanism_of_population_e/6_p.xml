<p class="p">Such an increase in wintering in northern areas was also recently observed in increasing populations of other birds with an extended wintering range such as the greylag goose (
 <italic class="italic">Anser anser</italic>) or the great crested grebe (
 <italic class="italic">Podiceps cristatus</italic>) in The Netherlands (Adriaensen etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>; Loonen &amp; De Vries, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Nilsson, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), or the European spoonbill in France (Caupenne &amp; Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>); for this latter species, it could also be due to saturation of southern wintering areas, and to the climate change that decreased the risk of wintering northernmost for many species (Fiedler, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Issa &amp; Muller, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The survival rate of spoonbills became lower in the usual main southernmost wintering areas than in the northernmost wintering areas (Lok, Overdijk, Tinbergen, &amp; Piersma,
