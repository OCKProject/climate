<p class="p">The results of the present study do not follow the Island theory: new inland breeders first bred in Brittany, far from the core breeding area of the continental subspecies 
 <italic class="italic">Ph. c. sinensis</italic> located in northern Europe, and the wintering population first preferentially occupied the most distant wintering areas such as the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, while occupancy of the northeastern areas proximate to the northwest European breeding population occurred well after (Figures

 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). This raises the issue of the suitability and carrying capacity of the different areas: Were they really much lower in the departments of Nord‐Picardy (n°1 in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) or in areas n°5 and 9 than on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts in the 1980s? Moreover, what can explain the strong increase of the numbers of wintering cormorants in Nord‐Picardy in the 2000s, in ecological habitats that existed in the 1980s when cormorants flew over them during migration, and in where there is no known reason for a recent increase in food resources? One explanation is that the southern and western optimal wintering areas, which had larger wetland surfaces, became saturated, and this induced an increasing shift to suboptimal northern areas where the availability of food resources was lower (smaller water surfaces) and more variable (cold wave, see below).
