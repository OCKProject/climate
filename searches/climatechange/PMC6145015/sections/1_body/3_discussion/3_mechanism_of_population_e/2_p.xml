There is a hierarchy in the chronology of occupancy from optimal to suboptimal areas, with suboptimal areas being becoming occupied once optimal areas are saturated (Krebs &amp; Davies

The Island theory concerns breeding populations, with new individuals (propagules) produced in the successive conquered zones that in turn participate to progressive geographical expansion. The case of wintering cormorants is different because they usually return to their native area located in northern Europe each following spring. Among birds in general the wintering area is usually quite far from the breeding area for climatic reasons. However, we can admit that a similar pattern to the Island theory could occur with the progressive geographical conquest of potential (more distant) wintering areas by cormorants for obvious energy costs of flight because the breeding and wintering populations successively increased in Europe after protection of cormorants by the EC Bird Directive in 1979 (Marion,
