<p class="p">Numerous studies on the climate change hypothesized a climate niche and thus predicted that future decreases in numbers in southern areas would be offset by increases in northern areas for many species (Harrison et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0801" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Pavón‐Jordán et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0807" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), or in wintering areas (Barbet‐Massin, Walther, Thuiller, Rahbek, &amp; Jiguet, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, according to Braunisch et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) such species distribution models could suffer from uncertainty because variables are often selected arbitrarily and their selection is difficult to control using contemporary information. But the numbers of cormorants did not decrease in southern areas, and neither did the numbers of wintering waders in Europe (Maclean et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In their long‐term study about wintering waders in Europe, these authors attributed the increasing northeastern weighted geographical centroid to the climate change, and so did Niven and Butcher (
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) about a global study of wintering bird species in the USA, but this was not the case for European dabbling duck species (Dalby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The present study on cormorants shows that the role of the climate was minor as compared to the protection of the species. Protection allowed for a strong increase in the breeding and consecutive wintering populations, with a time course of occupancy of the country largely more related to water surface areas (13.68% of the variance explained) than to climate (0.44%, Table 
 <xref rid="ece34348-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As a result, competition among individuals increased, forcing the dominated birds to use the suboptimal northern wintering areas and the secondary webs of watersheds. They did so despite the higher risk of mortality from unpredictable cold waves, likely to deplete the population only when the carrying capacity of the habitats reached the saturation level.
