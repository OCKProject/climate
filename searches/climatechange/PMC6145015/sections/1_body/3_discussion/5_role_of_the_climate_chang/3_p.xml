<p class="p">The only strong effect of the 2009 cold wave in France, and the low recovery during the relatively cold following winters, could be explained by two complementary factors: (a) during the previous cold waves, the occupancy of northeastern France was not important enough to imply a visible impact on the population of wintering cormorants 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> mortality or migration abroad; (b) the saturation of the country around 100,000 cormorants from 2005, reflecting the hypothesized carrying capacity of the country, implied fewer possibilities of refuge in other areas, including Spain where the wintering population also seemed saturated around 70,000–79,000 cormorants, as compared to its under‐saturation before 2005. Paradoxically, there was a strong and unexpected increase of the number of wintering cormorants in January 2013, while the latitude of the weighted geographical centroid was abnormally low (Figure
