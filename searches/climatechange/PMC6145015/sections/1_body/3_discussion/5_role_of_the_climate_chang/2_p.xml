<p class="p">Globally, the mean January temperature over the three 1981–2010 decades contributed marginally to the mean number of wintering cormorants in each French department according to the GLMs models. However, this mean January temperature partly explained the time‐course of early (1983) and relatively late (1992–1999) department occupancy, but did not explain the occupancy of the last seven departments. Rather than the mean January temperature over the whole period, the climate risk (cold waves) in the north‐east area may have prompted cormorants to favor the Atlantic and southern areas from the start. The global climate change over the three decades of the study probably had a relatively small effect on the shift of the weighted geographical centroid in a northeasterly direction (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The same was true for several waders in Europe (Maclean et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Pavón‐Jordán et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and 177 bird species in the USA; 79 bird species even shifted south (Niven &amp; Butcher, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), like the breeding population of cormorants in France from 1983 to 2015. At the French national scale, the mean annual temperature became warmer than the mean temperature over the 1961–1990 period, but mainly locally. For instance, there were 75% of the years with more than 80 days with negative daily temperatures in Lorraine (eastern France) over the 1951–1970 period, only 45% over the 1971–1990 period, and 17% over the 1991–2013 period. Among the three moderate cold waves during that last period (93 days &lt;0°C in 1996–1997, 87 in 2002–2003, and 80 in 2008–2009), only the latest one paradoxically had a strong effect on the numbers of wintering cormorants in France (−12.5% as compared to the previous census in 2007, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), even if the very high mean annual increasing rates observed until 1992 stopped in 1997. Again, the 2003 cold wave did not impact the number of cormorants, unlike in northern countries (Van Eerden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0808" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). No relation was highlighted over the whole period between the annual number of negative daily temperatures in France and the number of wintering cormorants between 1983 and 2015 or with the latitude of the weighted geographical centroid.
