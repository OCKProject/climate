<p class="p">The decrease in wintering cormorants along the Atlantic coast after 1992 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), although in an optimal area for the species, participated to the NNE shift range of the national population and was probably due to competition between the two marine and inland subspecies. Danish cormorants initially migrated mainly through eastern routes in the 1980s and 1990s, but migrated further west afterwards (Frederiksen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Maybe there where under the pressure of competition with new northeastern populations migrating for the first time, which could also partly explain the decreasing numbers of cormorants in Tunisia. In western France, Danish cormorants competed with Dutch cormorants, which had previously evicted British cormorants

 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), so the available feeding area was reduced, and consequently the number of cormorants.
