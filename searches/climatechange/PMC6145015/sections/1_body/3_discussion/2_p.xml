<p class="p">This study investigates the mechanisms of expansion of cormorant wintering populations in France and the changes in their distribution between 1983 and 2015 according to climate change and to competition for optimal areas. Our results show that year and department effects significantly explained the progressive evolution of cormorant site occupancy in France (68.87%). This evolution was also related to water surface areas (13.68%) and therefore to competition for optimal habitats. Although the role of temperature (0.44%) was significant, it should be mitigated to explain the shift of cormorant distribution across France. This being explained, we finally discuss the role of protecting areas, shooting, and behavior in roost atomization.</p>
