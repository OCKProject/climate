<p class="p">France is the main country for wintering and migrating cormorants in Europe. They mainly come from northern Europe (Frederiksen, Korner‐Nievergelt, Marion, &amp; Bregnballe, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), and France is the only European country where their populations have been monitored by exhaustive and regular national winter counts using the same method (this is essential to describe changes in bird populations according to Elmberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). As such, France is particularly adapted for a long‐term study (33 years) of the rapid changes in cormorant distribution and numbers. In the daytime, cormorants are dispersed in groups or individually in the feeding areas (web of rivers, lakes, lagoons, sea‐coasts). By contrast, they are very social at night: they join a few permanent night roosts (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34348-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) which are generally close to or surrounded by water in sites preferentially undisturbed by humans (safety behavior, Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Similarly to colonies of herons, the radius of the feeding area and thus the mean distance of feeding flights (and associated cost of flight) are thought to be related to the number of birds in the roost, which varies from few birds to more than 2,000 (Marion, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece34348-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">b</xref>). The aims of this study were (a) to summarize the strategy of the conquest of France by wintering cormorants at different geographical scales, and (b) to test if changes were temperature dependent in the context of the global climate change or mere consequences of the global protection of the species in Europe since the 1970s, because protection induced a strong increase of the population and thereby probably increased competition for optimal areas. We tested (a) if the progressive occupancy of the country was geographically oriented; (b) if the optimal areas were occupied first until saturation and before suboptimal areas; (c) which respective roles temperature and water surface areas played in the characterization of optimal wintering areas for the species; (d) whether there was a change in the strategy of cormorant distribution (roost size) to minimize costs of flight and competition.
