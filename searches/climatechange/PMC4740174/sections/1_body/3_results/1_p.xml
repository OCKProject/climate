<p class="p">To estimate an accurate chronology for the extinct megafauna and earliest human arrival in Sahul, we developed an ensemble-hindcasting model framework. We applied a set of six frequentist statistical methods (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to high-quality rated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> time series for 16 megafauna genera and to the archaeology of first human colonization of Sahul (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); these represent all of the available data (for both the megafauna and the archaeology time series) suitable for analysis (see details on the quality-rating approach in Methods). We developed a multi-model comparison (see Methods) to estimate the temporal window of coexistence between humans and megafauna. Our results show a peak in extinction events at 42.1 kyr (that is, median value of the distribution of estimated extinction dates in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) with a continent-wide confidence interval (CI
 <sub class="sub">megafauna</sub>) ranging from 36.7 to 48.1 kyr (75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution of estimated extinction dates in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>, respectively).
