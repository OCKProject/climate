<p class="p">The late Quaternary was a period of rapid and widespread extinction of about 65% of ‘megafauna' genera (that is, large vertebrates with mature individuals &gt;40 kg)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Although climatic shifts probably caused some of the largest mass extinctions earlier in Earth's history
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>, the role of climate in Quaternary faunal collapse is still hotly debated

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>, because many of these extinctions coincided with human colonization
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. The initial arrival of humans in Australia and New Guinea (then connected by a land bridge and hereafter referred to collectively as ‘Sahul'), and extinction of the megafauna took place close to, or beyond, the limit of radiocarbon (
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C) dating (55–45 kyr ago, kyr=10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> years), leading to uncertainty whether humans had a specific and important role in driving continent-wide extinctions of megafauna in Sahul
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The ‘climate-driven' hypothesis of Australian extinction states that changes in climate variability coupled with severe aridification from about the last 430 kyr caused the extinctions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Alternatively, the ‘human-driven' hypothesis stipulates that hunting was the major cause of extinctions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, and/or that humans modified natural fire regimes enough to alter vegetation communities and disrupt trophic dynamics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. A third hypothesis emphasizes a possible human–climate synergy, in which human impacts delivered the
