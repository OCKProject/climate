<p class="p">We also included temperature and precipitation proxies based on a hindcast of the HadCM3 global circulation model focussed specifically on Sahul. This model consists of linked atmospheric, ocean and sea ice models at a spatial resolution of 2.5° latitude × 3.75° longitude resampled at a 1 × 1° resolution
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. The temporal resolution of the raw data is 1 kyr slices back to 22 kyr, 2 kyr from 22 to 80 kyr and 4 kyr to 120 kyr; thus, we ran our analyses using a 4-kyr running mean (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We tested whether both the EPICA record and ENSOp data are representative of Sahul's palaeoclimate by calculating the spatial correlation of HadCM3 model outputs (temperature and precipitation) over the last 120 kyr for each gridcell to both EPICA and ENSOp. The strong correlation between these variables justifies the use of both EPICA and ENSOp as appropriate measures of climate variation in Sahul (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref>). We also used the HadCM3 palaeoclimate simulation data to calculate vectors of climate velocity (km per year) for mean annual temperature (°C) and mean annual precipitation (mm per day) following established methods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. Climate velocity describes the rate (and direction) that an organism would need to migrate to maintain an isocline of a temperature and precipitation variable
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. This proxy is often considered synonymous with the rate of climate displacement for a species, such that the higher the velocity, the less probable a species will keep pace with its shifting climatic niche and thus survive. Climate velocity is considered to be more biologically relevant than the use of climate anomalies, because it accounts for regional changes in climate and the ability of topographic heterogeneity to buffer biota against these changes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. We divided the rate of climate change through time (°C per year) by the spatial gradient in climate at that location (°C km
