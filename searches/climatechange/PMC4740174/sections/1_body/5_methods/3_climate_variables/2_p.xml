<p class="p">The climate of a large part of eastern and northern Sahul is sensitive to changes in ENSO activity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>; thus, metrics describing variation in the strength of ENSO events (such as ENSOp) are a good proxy for shifts in precipitation and temperature, and for changes in aridity. We extracted modelled ENSOp variation directly from Tudhope 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, who estimated ENSOp variability from application of the Zebiak–Cane coupled ocean–atmosphere model forced only by changing orbital parameters. ENSOp is an extracted sea surface temperature signal from the Nino 3 region, for which the higher power inference means more important effects of El Niño events (that is, increase in rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific and drier-than-normal conditions over northern Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines).
