<p class="p">Both the timing of megafauna extinction and first human arrival in Sahul have long been controversial given the lack of reliable data and bias introduced by the Signorâ€“Lipps effect. Having now accounted for these deficiencies, our results support the general conclusions of previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>, but they are much better constrained by more diverse and expanded data sets that have been rigorously scrutinized using the best-available analytical tools. It is generally accepted that humans were present in Australia by 48 kyr

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. Our modelled age estimate of 55.6 kyr reflects the early human colonization of northern Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>, but geographic gaps in high-quality data (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) prevent a reliable interpretation of the pattern of human dispersal across Sahul. It is clear, however, that humans were present in Tasmania by 39 kyr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> and in the arid centre of Australia by 35 kyr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>.
