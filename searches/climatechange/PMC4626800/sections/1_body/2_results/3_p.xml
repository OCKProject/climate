<p class="p">We constructed a global map of relative contributions of the major climatic control factors (demand, supply and energy) influencing ET (see Methods). Water supply most strongly influences ET over 49% of the global domain, whereas available energy and atmospheric water demand are dominant influences on ET over 32% and 19% of the global domain, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). The atmospheric demand for ET shows the most extensive changes globally over the 32-year record (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>). Approximately 29% of the global domain shows significant (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.1) increases in ET demand from 1982 to 2013, mainly driven by a general global warming trend and associated increases in air vapor pressure deficit (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>), while 8% of the domain shows significant decreases in ET demand for the period, including western South America, and resulting from regional cooling and/or reduction of vapor pressure deficit (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S3e</xref>). The available energy for ET shows the second most extensive significant changes over the global domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). Approximately 8% of the domain shows significant increases in available energy for ET, mainly over tropical and subtropical regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>) due to reduction in total cloudiness
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>; about 18% of the domain shows significant reductions in available energy for ET, mainly located over eastern Asia, central North America, Sudanian Savanna, and Australia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>), which are mainly caused by reduced incoming solar radiation over the study period due to emission of anthropogenic aerosols
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. The available water supply for ET shows the smallest trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2d</xref>). Only small portions of the global domain show significant changes in water supply (9% and 6% for increasing and decreasing supply, respectively). Regions with significant positive water supply trends are mainly located in the subtropics and high latitudes, including the African Sahel, while areas with significant negative water supply trends are predominantly located in the mid-latitudes. The observed changes in climatic control factors predominantly favor increasing ET, consistent with the finding of rising global land ET over the same period. However, increases in water supply are lagging the coincident rise in atmospheric moisture demand with warming, indicating that ET may become more supply limited on a global basis if these trends persist in the future.
