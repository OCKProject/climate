<p class="p">Although discussions of co-benefits are often framed around health co-benefits of actions to mitigate or adapt to climate change, it is useful to recognize that some public health actions that have long been promoted in urban areas may be seen as having co-benefits in the climate arena. For example, more widespread adoption of dietary changes promoted to improve cardiovascular health, such as lower consumption of meats (particularly beef), would substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions because production systems that support diets high in meat generate much more emissions than those that support vegetarian or high fish diets [

Likewise, campaigns whose purpose is to promote health through increased physical activity such as biking and walking will have important environmental co-benefits through reductions in automobile-related pollutant emissions. These health policies thus have the potential for doubly benefiting the most disadvantaged, through direct health impacts and through their secondary impacts via environmental change and prevention of the most adverse effects of climate change.
