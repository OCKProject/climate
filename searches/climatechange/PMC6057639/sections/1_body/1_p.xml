<p class="p">Urban populations, and especially socially and economically disadvantaged populations within urban areas, are likely to be especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002621.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. For example, it is well known that people living in urban centers are exposed to higher extreme temperatures because of the heat island effect. Urban populations may have concurrent exposures to air pollutants and social stressors, and those with low income may be more likely to suffer from comorbid conditions that make them more sensitive to heat effects. Low-income populations are also less able to take adaptive actions, for example, because they lack and cannot afford air conditioning to avoid heat exposure [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002621.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Low-income, urban neighborhoods may have less green space, less energy-efficient housing, and fewer community resources necessary to escape and mitigate the impact of heat. They may also live in areas that are more subject to flooding and have fewer resources to adjust to flooding when it occurs [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002621.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The growth of urban populations all over the world makes a focus on the impact of climate change on health in cities especially relevant.
