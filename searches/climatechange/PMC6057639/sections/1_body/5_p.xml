Safe, active transport design that separates cars from bicyclists and walkers could have the added health co-benefit of reducing the frequency and severity of injuries. These co-benefits could be most impactful among urban, low-income populations, who are more likely to have lower physical activity and a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [
