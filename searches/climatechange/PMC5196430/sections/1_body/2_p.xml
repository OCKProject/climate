<p class="p">Here we test the two hypotheses that plants and animals with (1) narrow climatic niches and (2) a projected loss in climatic suitability are biotic specialists that interact with a low diversity of partners. We additionally simulate (3) how the relationship between biotic specialization and vulnerability to climate change affects the risk of species coextinctions of plants and animals under future climatic conditions. We analysed data on climatic niche breadth for 295 species of plants and their insect pollinators (196 bee, 70 butterfly and 97 hoverfly species) and seed dispersers (51 bird species) from central Europe. For each species, we quantified the change in climatic suitability across a species' current European range under projected climate change according to two circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 6.0 and 8.5). We linked projected changes in climatic suitability to data on biotic specialization derived from 8 quantitative pollination and 5 quantitative seed-dispersal networks recorded in 13 regions across central Europe. Networks describe interaction frequencies between plant and animal species, that is, the number of visits of an animal to a plant species, and yield empirical estimates of biotic specialization for each species in each network.</p>
