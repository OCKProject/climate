<p class="p">In ecological communities, species are embedded in networks of interacting species, for instance, in mutualistic networks between plant species and animal pollinators or seed dispersers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Species in these networks vary in the number of interaction partners, for example, because of differences in species traits
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, and thus differ in their degree of biotic specialization
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. So far, it has not been tested how biotic specialization in ecological networks relates to a species' climatic niche breadth and its vulnerability to climate change. However, a quantitative understanding of this relationship is required to predict the likelihood of species extinctions and coextinctions from ecological communities under climate change
