<p class="p">Based on the projected impacts of climate change on plant and animal species, we modelled effects of climate change on each network. We simulated secondary species extinction as a consequence of the sequential loss of plant and animal species, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. The order of species loss followed the projected changes in climatic suitability; thus, we first removed the species experiencing the largest decline in climatic suitability across the current European range, followed by the removal of the species with the second largest decline until the least vulnerable species had been removed. In the simulation model, species became secondarily extinct once they had lost at least 25, 50 or 75% of their interaction events in respect to the original network, assuming that interaction frequencies are proportional to the functional dependences of animals on plants and vice versa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. These thresholds for secondary extinction are probably more realistic than the assumption that all interaction events have to be lost before a species goes extinct
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. We further assumed that species could reallocate lost interactions to other persisting species in the network accounting for the flexibility of partner choice in interaction networks
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. We simulated two different rewiring scenarios under the assumption that no new species will enter the network. First, we reallocated a varying proportion of removed interactions to all persisting partners (constrained rewiring), proportional to the relative interaction frequencies of each species. Second, we reallocated lost interactions to all persisting species (unconstrained rewiring), relative to species' total interaction frequencies. Thus, the first scenario assumes that species will be constrained in their interactions to their current partners, whereas the second scenario assumes that species are able to freely establish new links under future conditions. We varied the flexibility of species to reallocate lost interactions to persisting species between 0% (no reallocation) and 100% (reallocation of all interactions). In the scenario where all partners are interchangeable (100% flexibility), all interaction events must be lost to trigger secondary extinction as all lost interaction events are reallocated to persisting species. In a scenario of unconstrained rewiring and 100% flexibility, thus, all species need to go extinct to trigger secondary extinction. As this is a very unlikely scenario, it was omitted from our simulations.
