<p class="p">We measured plant and animal specialization in two ways based on the number and uniqueness of interaction partners within each network. First, we calculated the effective number of partners. It equals the diversity 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>
 <sup class="sup">H</sup> of interaction frequencies per species (based on the Shannon index 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>) and is equivalent to the number of partners if each link was equally common
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>. This metric is positively related to the total interaction frequency of plants (log–log scale, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=591, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.68) and animals (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=1009, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.76). On average, plants had a higher diversity of partners than animals (mean 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>
 <sup class="sup">H</sup>±1 s.e., 4.20±0.17 versus 2.61±0.10). Second, we calculated complementary specialization 
 <italic class="italic">d'</italic> as the deviation between the observed interactions and partner selection according to species' total interaction frequencies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>. The metric ranges from 0 for a generalist species (sharing partners with many others) to 1 for a fully specialized species (with a unique set of partners). 
 <italic class="italic">d'</italic> was unrelated to total interaction frequency (plants, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.03; animals, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.06) and was similar for plants and animals (0.34±0.01 versus 0.32±0.01).
