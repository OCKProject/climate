<p class="p">We tested the statistical associations between species' biotic specialization within each network and climatic hypervolume (square-root transformed), OMI climatic niche breadth (geometric mean of variances along the first two OMI ordination axes) and projected changes in climatic suitability (median change across a species' current European range) with linear mixed-effects models; error distributions of all models did not deviate from normality. We fitted statistical models including main and interaction effects of the respective climatic predictor and trophic level (animal versus plant) on biotic specialization. In all models, we accounted for random variation due to network identity, plant and animal taxonomy on the model intercepts (taxonomic levels: family, genus, species). To account for variation in the performance of species distribution models and, thus, for the uncertainty of projected changes in climatic suitability, we weighted the respective linear mixed-effects models with the accuracy of the respective species distribution model as given by the TSS

In order to examine network-specific relationships between biotic specialization and climatic variables, we additionally tested effects of climatic predictors on biotic specialization in models accounting for both random intercepts and slopes of network identity, separately for plants and animals.
