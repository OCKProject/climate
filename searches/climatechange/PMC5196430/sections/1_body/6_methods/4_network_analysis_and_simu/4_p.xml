<p class="p">For each network and simulation scenario, we quantified network sensitivity to plant and animal species extinction by the area above the secondary extinction curve; the metric ranges from 0 (no species go secondarily extinct) to 1 (all species go secondarily extinct after removing a single species) and is conversely equivalent to network robustness (the area under the extinction curve
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>). We computed the difference in network sensitivity to plant and animal extinction for each RCP projection and each coextinction, rewiring and species' flexibility scenario. We further compared network sensitivity for the different simulation scenarios between projected climate change and 200 random sequences of species loss; here network sensitivity was averaged across iterations of random extinction for each simulation scenario. We tested whether the risk of secondary animal versus secondary plant extinction differed between climate change and random extinction using two-sided, pair-wise
