<p class="p">We compiled occurrence data for plant and animal species recorded in eight quantitative pollination and five quantitative seed-dispersal networks from central Europe (

Contiguous large areas of plant occurrence were generalized as range polygons; spatially isolated occurrences were digitized as single-point locations. Distributional data on most wild bee taxa were extracted from GBIF and from a database hosted at the University of Mons (Belgium) (Atlas Hymenoptera

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> for the spatial extent of the used grid). Data aggregation at the 50 × 50 km grid further mitigates effects of low sampling intensity, that is, an overestimation of species' absences for some insect taxa.
