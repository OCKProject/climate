<p class="p">In total, we were able to derive independent data of biotic specialization, climatic niche breadth and vulnerability to climate change for 363 insect (196 bees, 70 butterflies, 97 hoverflies; pollinators hereafter), 51 bird (seed dispersers hereafter) and 295 plant species (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Including species with deficient occurrence data and/or other animal taxa for which no distribution data were available (for example, other Diptera or Coleoptera that had been sampled for a few of the original pollination networks) resulted in qualitatively identical estimates of biotic specialization for the analysed plant and animal species.
