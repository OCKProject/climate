<p class="p">We matched data on climatic niche breadth and vulnerability with empirical data of biotic specialization derived from eight quantitative pollination and five quantitative seed-dispersal networks, each recorded within a different region in central Europe (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). We included these networks in the analyses because they report comprehensive data on interaction frequencies between species pairs, consistently recorded by direct plant observations over several months (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Interaction frequencies equal the number of visits of an animal to a plant species. To cover all potential interaction partners of a species within the regional context, we summed interaction frequencies over time and space within each region as most networks were recorded on repeated visits at several localities within each region. Interaction data from other animal taxa than bees, butterflies, hoverflies and birds were excluded from the original networks. As it is generally the case for mutualistic networks, we lack information on the actual functional dependences of pollinators and seed dispersers on their foraging plants and vice versa and, thus, assume that interaction frequency is closely associated with the reciprocal functional importance of the interacting species
