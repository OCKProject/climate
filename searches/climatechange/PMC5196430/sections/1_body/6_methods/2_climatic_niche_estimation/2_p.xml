<p class="p">We quantified probabilities of occurrence from species' recorded presences and absences with species distribution models based on boosted regression trees
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" class="xref">63</xref>, using a cross-validation approach to estimate the optimal number of trees (number of initial trees=10, tree complexity=2, learning rate=0.01). To evaluate model performance, we calculated the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref> where the sum of the model's sensitivity and specificity was maximal (TSS
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>). AUC and TSS
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were calculated as the arithmetic mean of 10 random splits of data into 75% used for model calibration and 25% for model testing. Arithmetic means (±1 s.d.) of AUC/TSS
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values were: 0.85±0.046/0.58±0.093 (bees), 0.84±0.057/0.57±0.120 (butterflies), 0.79±0.057/0.49±0.107 (hoverflies), 0.94±0.031/0.77±0.074 (birds), and 0.95±0.026/0.80±0.073 (plants), indicating good to very good (pollinators) or excellent (birds, plants) model performance under current conditions (

We used the full set of current occurrences of each species for calculating model projections under current and future conditions. Future climate projections were obtained from two general circulation models from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (CCSM4, MIROC5 (refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>)) using two scenarios of RCPs assuming an average increase of 2.85±0.62 °C (RCP 6.0) or 4.02±0.80 °C (RCP 8.5) in mean annual temperature for the geographic area covered (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> for the projected changes in all climatic variables). We quantified the potential vulnerability of a species to projected climate change by changes in climatic suitability for each grid cell covered by the species' current European range, defined by the difference between the probabilities of occurrence under current (years 1950–2000) versus projected future conditions for 2070 (averaged for 2061–2080). For each species, changes in climatic suitability were summarized using the median change across all grid cells of the species' current European range; projections were averaged between the two circulation models and calculated separately for each RCP scenario (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for a data overview). Restricting the vulnerability quantification to a species' current distribution may overestimate extinction risk because areas outside the current range, which may become suitable in the future, are not considered. However, this approach accurately quantifies species' exposure to projected changes in climatic conditions and avoids several simplifying assumptions, for example, about species' dispersal ability, non-analogue climates or novel biotic interactions that are particularly problematic in range projections beyond current distributions
