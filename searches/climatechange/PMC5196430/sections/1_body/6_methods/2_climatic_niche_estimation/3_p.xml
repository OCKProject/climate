<p class="p">Changes in climatic suitability were very closely correlated between the two RCP scenarios (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=709 species, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.97), but were only weakly related to current climatic niche breadth (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=709 species, climatic hypervolume, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>&lt;0.5 for both RCP scenarios; OMI climatic niche breadth, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>&lt;0.4 for both RCP scenarios). Changes in climatic suitability at the regional scale (that is, within the nine grid cells adjacent to each network's study region) were closely correlated to range-wide suitability changes (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=709 species, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.74 for both RCP scenarios). We used range-wide suitability changes because they are more representative for a species' vulnerability across its range and are less sensitive to local climatic projections.
