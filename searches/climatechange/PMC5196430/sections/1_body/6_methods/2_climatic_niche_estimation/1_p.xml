<p class="p">We computed the current range size of a species as the number of grid cells with observed presences within the European CGRS grid; in the case of avian migrants, only presences within the breeding range were considered. We omitted species from the analyses for which no or deficient occurrence data were digitally available; the number of occupied grid cells per species ranged from 19 to 2,917 (median=815 occurrences across the 50 × 50 km grid, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Species' realized climatic niches were quantified as a function of their occurrences and four variables of current climate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref> (annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality, sampled for the used grid). We used two alternative methods for quantifying the current climatic niche breadth of a species (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for a data overview). First, we used the hypervolume method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>, which calculates the realized climatic niche breadth by using a multidimensional kernel density estimation procedure to estimate an 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-dimensional hypervolume from a set of species' occurrences and the respective climatic variables. To calculate the climatic hypervolume, we 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>-standardized climatic variables and used a Silverman bandwidth estimator and a 0% quantile threshold
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. Second, we used the outlying mean index (OMI) that quantifies the distance between realized and background climate conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref>. In contrast to other multivariate methods for niche quantification (such as canonical correspondence or redundancy analysis), it makes no assumption about the shape of the response curve to the environment (that is, climate) and is not influenced by species richness
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref>. Along each ordination axis, the OMI calculates niche breadth as variances based on the climatic conditions at the localities of species' occurrences. Based on the first and second OMI ordination axes (cumulative inertia of both axes: 89%), we defined species' realized niche breadth as the geometric mean of variances along these two axes. Both methods resulted in similar estimates of realized climatic niche breadth (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=709 species, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.92) and were positively associated with the current range size of a species (hypervolume, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.54; OMI niche breadth, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.67). We also tested whether the spatial extent of the analysis may have affected estimates of climatic niche breadth. We found that the OMI climatic niche breadth, derived from occurrences across the entire Palearctic for plants and birds, was closely correlated to that at the European scale (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=346 species, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.83). Occurrence data beyond Europe were not available for insect pollinators and all taxa were therefore analysed at the European scale.
