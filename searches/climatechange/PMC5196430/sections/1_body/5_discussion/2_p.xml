<p class="p">In line with our second hypothesis, we found that specialized animals may indeed be more vulnerable to climate change than generalists. Thus, climate change is likely to trigger a decline or even the local extinction of animal species that are constrained by the occurrence of specific plant partners

However, as the most connected animals seem to be relatively tolerant to projected changes in climatic conditions, climate change may only have weak indirect impacts on ecological networks via top-down effects from animals to plants. In contrast to animals, we did not detect a relationship between biotic specialization and vulnerability to climate change for plants in central Europe. This result suggests that highly connected plants are similarly threatened as weakly connected plants. The decline or loss of highly connected plants that interact with many animal partners could have important bottom-up impacts on animal species and ecological networks
