<p class="p">Biotic interactions have often been neglected in assessments of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Here we demonstrate for central Europe that animal pollinators and seed dispersers that interact with a low diversity of plant partners are particularly vulnerable to climate change. In contrast, plants' vulnerability and biotic specialization are unrelated. This difference between animals and plants has important consequences for their projected coextinction risks under climate change as cascading effects from plants to animals are likely to trigger animal coextinctions in mutualistic networks and can aggravate impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Accounting for biotic interactions between species is, therefore, important for accurately predicting impacts of climate change on animals, whereas plantâ€“animal interactions are less relevant for predicting plant responses to climate change. Correspondingly, ecological functions to plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal by animals, appear to be robust to climate-induced extinctions of animals.
