<p class="p">Simulations of species coextinctions indeed demonstrate that mutualistic networks are more sensitive to plant extinction than to animal extinction under climate change in central Europe. This effect could be related to two different mechanisms. First, most studied networks comprised more animal than plant species (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. However, differences between secondary animal and secondary plant extinction were generally larger under climate-induced extinction than under random extinction. As random extinction accounts for differences in animal and plant species numbers and mean specialization in each network, differences in species coextinction between climate change and random extinction must be due to an alternative second mechanism. Different impacts of plant and animal extinction on the networks are, thus, linked to the different relationships between biotic specialization and vulnerability to climate change for plants and animals. As animal species with the highest vulnerability to climate change had a low diversity of plant partners (
