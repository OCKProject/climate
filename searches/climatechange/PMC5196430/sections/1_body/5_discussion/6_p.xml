<p class="p">Under the assumptions that interaction frequencies are surrogates of functional dependences between species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref> and that no new species will enter the networks, we show that plant extinctions in response to climate change will cause cascading effects on animal species in mutualistic networks. Such bottom-up effects may be particularly severe for animal groups that depend on plant resources throughout their life cycle (that is, in the larval and adult stage) and are restricted to specific resource types, such as many insect taxa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, rather than for animals that are able to use alternative resources, such as most birds
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. Indeed, a high risk of extinction cascades from lower to higher trophic levels has been shown for specialized plantâ€“insect interactions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. In addition, direct effects of habitat and climate change on animals are likely to exacerbate their indirect effects mediated by bottom-up extinction cascades
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. To quantify the adaptive capacity of animals and plants in ecological networks, long-term studies across multiple communities or translocation experiments for specific communities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> will be needed. Such experiments will also be useful to test whether the intensity of the indirect effects of climate change on biodiversity varies among functional groups of plants and animals.
