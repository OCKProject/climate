<p class="p">Our results suggest that animal extinction under climate change will only weakly affect animals' ecological function to plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Although this finding has important implications for ecosystem functioning, the simulations did not account for variability in the functional quality of different animal mutualists
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Thus, the inference of our simulation model is limited to quantitative contributions of animals to ecosystem functions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, such as the number of visits by animal pollinators or seed dispersers. Nevertheless, our simulation model suggests a high robustness of plants to animal extinction in future communities. This is consistent with the finding that mutualistic networks on islands generally lack a high diversity of animal pollinators and seed dispersers, but apparently maintain their pivotal functions to plants

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. In natural communities, the tolerance of plants to the loss of their mutualistic animal partners is further increased because many plant taxa can locally persist for extended time periods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. This suggests that the functional dependence of plants on their animal pollinators and seed dispersers is comparatively low and, at least for some plant taxa, may be weakly related to the reciprocal dependences derived from mutualistic plantâ€“animal networks.
