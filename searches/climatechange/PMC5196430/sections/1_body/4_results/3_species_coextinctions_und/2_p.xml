<p class="p">Across networks, we found that secondary animal extinctions were more likely to occur than secondary plant extinctions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In almost all scenarios, this difference was larger under climate change than under random extinction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) independent of the chosen RCP scenario (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Differences between climate change and random extinction were most pronounced if we assumed a high species' sensitivity to coextinction and a low capacity for rewiring lost interactions to other partners (see, for example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). Scenarios in which many interactions needed to be lost to trigger secondary extinction differed less between climate change and random extinction, especially if species were able to reallocate many of their lost interactions to persisting species in the network (see, for example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3f</xref>). Hence, animal coextinctions in response to plant extinction were most frequent if animals were limited in their flexibility to respond to future changes in partner availability.
