<p class="p">We simulated secondary extinctions of animal and plant species from mutualistic networks as a consequence of sequential species loss from the other trophic level. Extending upon previous simulations of species coextinctions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, we informed our simulation model with projected changes in climatic suitability for plant and animal species and removed species sequentially from the highest to the lowest decrease in climatic suitability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). We modelled species coextinction under different scenarios of species' sensitivity to partner loss assuming that a 25, 50 or 75% decrease in total interaction frequency would trigger the secondary extinction of a species from the regional network. These thresholds are probably more realistic than the assumption that all interaction partners must be lost to trigger secondary extinction

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, given the frequency of coextinctions reported in empirical and modelling studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. In the simulation, we further accounted for the potential flexibility of species in the choice of their interaction partners by reallocating a varying proportion of lost interaction events to persisting species. We account for a potential rewiring of interactions to new partners
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> by comparing a scenario of constrained rewiring to persisting partners with a scenario of unconstrained rewiring to all persisting species. We did not consider, however, that new species may enter the interaction networks and, thus, may overestimate extinction risks under climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. Furthermore, we assumed that interaction frequencies indeed reflect the reciprocal functional dependences of animals on plants and vice versa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. For each network and simulation scenario, we quantified the relationship between primary and secondary species extinctions, yielding a measure of network sensitivity to plant and animal extinction, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). We compared network sensitivity to species coextinction between extinction sequences due to climate change and due to random extinction, thereby accounting for effects that are independent of the extinction sequence, such as inherent differences in species numbers and mean specialization between plants and animals.
