 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Although models predicting the responses of individual species to climate change are widely utilized
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>, it is not yet clear to what extent a changing climate will affect biotic interactions between species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Ecological theory predicts that abundant generalist species tend to have large ranges
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref> and, consequently, occupy wide climatic niches
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>, whereas species specialized on specific interaction partners have small ranges, occupy narrow climatic niches and may therefore be particularly vulnerable to climate change
