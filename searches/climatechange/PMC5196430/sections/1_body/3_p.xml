<p class="p">We find that animal species with narrow climatic niches and a projected loss in climatic suitability interact with a low diversity of plant partners, whereas we do not find analogous relationships for plants. This important difference between plant and animal species affects the likelihood of species coextinctions under climate change. We simulate different scenarios of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches and show with these simulations that mutualistic networks are more sensitive to projected plant than to animal extinctions under climate change. We conclude that a high potential for adaptive partner switches is required to stabilize mutualistic networks against extinction cascades from plants to animals under climate change.</p>
