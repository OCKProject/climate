  <title class="title">Differences in sensitivity to species extinction across 13 mutualistic networks.</title>
  <p class="p">Shown are differences in network sensitivity to plant versus animal extinction for different scenarios of species' sensitivity to coextinction, rewiring capacity and flexibility. Coextinction thresholds varied between (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) 25%, (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) 50% and (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) 75% of interaction loss. Species were able to rewire interactions (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) to persisting partners (constrained rewiring) or (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) to all persisting species in each network (unconstrained rewiring). Flexibility values (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%) indicate the proportion of lost interactions that was reallocated to other species in the respective scenario; we omitted the very unlikely scenario of unconstrained rewiring and 100% flexibility as it requires all species to go extinct to trigger secondary extinction. Shown are mean differences (Â±1 s.e.) across the 13 pollination and seed-dispersal networks between the impact of plant versus animal extinction; values &gt;0 (red bars) indicate a higher risk of secondary animal than secondary plant extinction and values &lt;0 (blue bars) indicate the opposite. Secondary animal versus secondary plant extinction was compared between climate change and random extinction using two-sided, pair-wise
