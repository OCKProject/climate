  <p class="p">Network metrics, climatic niche breadth and climatic suitability change. For 295 plant and 414 animal species, we provide information on plant and animal taxonomy (class, order, family), the effective number of interaction partners, complementary specialization d' (uniqueness of interaction partners relative to other species [range 0-1]), range size(number of grid cells with observed presences within the European CGRS grid, 50 km x 50 km), current realized climatic niche breadth (climatic hypervolume, OMI climatic niche breadth), and projected changes in climatic suitability (median difference between the probabilities of occurrence under current [years 1950-2000] versus future conditions [years 2061-2080], averaged across two climate models [CCSM4, MIROC5]) for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5). AUC [range 0-1] and TSSmax [range -1-1] values denote the accuracy of species distribution models in predicting species' presences. If species occurred in several networks, we provide mean specialization metrics across networks.</p>
