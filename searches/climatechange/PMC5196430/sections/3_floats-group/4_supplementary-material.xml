  <title class="title">Supplementary Data 1</title>
  <p class="p">Metadata of 13 mutualistic networks. Given are network type, geographic location, habitat type, sampling duration and the number of visitation events, plant and animal species in each network. We only included species in the networks for which occurrence data were available and provide the number of excluded plant and animal species for the study taxa (plants; bees, butterflies, hoverflies and birds) in respect to the original network. We also report important network metrics for each network: number of links, connectance (i.e. the proportion of realized links), weighted nestedness (weighted NODF), weighted modularity (QuanBiMo Q, range 0-1), mean number of effective animal partners (per plant species), mean number of effective plant partners (per animal species) and complementary specialization H2' (i.e. the degree of niche divergence among species, range 0-1). Original sources for each network are also provided.</p>
