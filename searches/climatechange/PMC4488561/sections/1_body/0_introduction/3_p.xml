<p class="p">Species distribution modeling (SDM) is widely used in ecology, biogeography, and evolutionary studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In recent years, SDM using Maxent method has contributed significantly to the prediction of biodiversity loss under future climate scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and to the rational use of environmental resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] threatened by upcoming climate changes. Importantly, Maxent is able to function with presence-only data, such as those of speciesâ€™ distribution records. It requires only geo-referenced occurrence data to predict the distribution of suitable habitat for a species through determinations of the probability distribution of maximum entropy [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] coupled with environmental information for the whole study area.
