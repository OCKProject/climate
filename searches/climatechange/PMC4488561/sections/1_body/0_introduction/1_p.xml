 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] predicts that global climate warming will continue and the average temperature on the planet will have increased by 0.3–4.5°C through the end of the 21st century (relative to the 1986–2005 baseline). Current changes have already markedly affected the temporal and spatial properties of climate in China: (1) the spatial and temporal distributions of the heat resource have become very uneven, (2) the cold regions of the north have experienced rapid increases in temperature, and (3) the spatial unevenness of precipitation is increasing [
