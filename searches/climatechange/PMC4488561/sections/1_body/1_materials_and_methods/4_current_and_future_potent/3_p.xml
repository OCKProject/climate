<p class="p">After modeling the current suitable habitat area for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> with current climate data, we performed modeling projections for future climate scenarios (RCP2.6–2050, RCP2.6–2070, RCP8.5–2050, and RCP8.5–2070) to predict the future suitable habitat area for the species. The SDM projections were calculated with Maxent software. We cross-checked future suitable habitat areas against the current distribution area of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> to identify regions that had become (i) unsuitable, (ii) suitable, and (iii) remained unchanged with respect to suitability; we then calculated and illustrated the areas of regions identified in (i)-(iii).
