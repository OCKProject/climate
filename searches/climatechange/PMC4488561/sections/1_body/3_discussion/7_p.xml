 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> has a broad adaptability under the current and future climates, but much of the suitable area might disappear due to land use transformations and humans exploitation for economic purpose. Practically the entire suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> is transected by or within the vicinity of populated places, and much of the suitable area for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> has already been converted into agriculture or urbanized. Studies are still needed to qualify the anthropogenic impacts on the adaptation to future climates for this wide-spread conifer tree.
