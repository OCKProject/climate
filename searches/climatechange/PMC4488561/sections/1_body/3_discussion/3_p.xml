<p class="p">In our modeling exercise, temperature and wetness are among the most important factors affecting the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>. Previous studies have shown that seeds germination rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> decreases rapidly with decreasing of matric water potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Water availability is correlated with many environmental factors that influence the physiological and biochemical processes of plants, e.g. soil moisture is shown to be the main factor affecting the plant assimilation rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The number of branches and female flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> are significantly associated with the average annual rainfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] while the male flower development are closely related to both temperature and precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the seedling emergence rate and death rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> are directly affected by temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. All these hydrothermal factors may have played main roles in shaping the ecological adaptation of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>, and have great impacts on the distribution of this conifer tree.
