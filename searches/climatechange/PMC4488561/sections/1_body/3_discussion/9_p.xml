<p class="p">Adaptation strategies to climate change, such as assisted migration, have gained increasing attention as we seek to help plants keep pace with changing climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Our modeling predicted an apparent shift of suitable habitat area for

 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> toward high latitudes and elevations, and also identified the low elevation regions in southern China facing high risks of habitat loss. We propose the following management strategy in response to future climate change: (1) implementation of seed collection and banking actions across the entire species range to provide a safety net in the face of natural and human uncertainty; (2) a focus on target populations likely to go extinct under climate change, especially those at low altitudes and latitudes; and (3) the use of seeds collected in the southern portion of the range to augment extant plantation in the northern portion, thereby introgressing potentially adaptive traits.
