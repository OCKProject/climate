 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], the trends may differ between widely distributed species and those that have narrow ranges of occurrence. Plants with small distribution usually have a constrained ecological adaptability and are more susceptible to the impact of climate change. As an example, the suitable habitat area of the herb, 
 <italic class="italic">Sinopodophyllum hexandrum</italic>, was predicted to fluctuate widely under future climate changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Plants with larger distribution may have broader adaptability and greater resistance to climate change. We found, under the future climate conditions, the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> increased slightly at first, but then began to decrease and fragment as the suitable areas shifted to higher latitudes and elevations during climate warming intensification; these trends are in line with those of previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. For example, the suitable habitat area for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus massoniana</italic> will shrink [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and that of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotaxus chienii</italic> will likely become fragmented [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and reduced under climate change. Habitat fragmentation represents a major threat to tree populations by reducing local population size and gene flow from other populations, which in turn can decrease outcrossing rates, genetic variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] and the adaptation to future climates. Little is known about the magnitude, direction or time scale of habitat fragmentation impacts on reproductive success and ultimately population viability of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>. In addition to shifts to higher latitudes and elevations, attentions should also be taken to fragmentation and shrinkage in habitats in evaluating the climate change impacts and developing a global change forest management strategy.
