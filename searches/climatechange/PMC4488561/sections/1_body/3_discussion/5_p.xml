 <xref rid="pone.0132326.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). It was predicted that under the low concentration greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP2.6), suitable habitat range will increase as global warming intensity proceeds. Under the higher concentrations of the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP8.5), we predicted a slight expansion in the next 40 years around 2050 followed by the slight contraction in the next 70 years around 2070. Overall, our prediction showed that the shift in distribution of suitable habitat areas to high latitudes and elevations would become gradually more significant, while low-latitude regions, such as Guangdong and Guangxi, would see a significant decrease in distribution. Our study emphasizes that forest surveillance should be planed for marginal populations both in low and high latitudes, so as to give a reasonable management advice in context of future climate change.
