<p class="p">The manner in which conservation management should respond to change will depend on the response of the ecological community at particular localities (
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). However, all of the management goals discussed here require a move away from the current paradigm that focuses on specific endpoints or reference states [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. In areas where climate is projected to no longer support current communities, management should focus on maintaining ecosystem function, and actively managing grasslands that are currently in good condition. The higher floristic and genetic diversity of these grasslands is likely to confer resilience to change in the short term, and greater adaptive capacity in the long term [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Maintenance of ecosystem function could be achieved by minimizing further fragmentation, weed invasion and stress from other land uses, while accepting that compositional change is inevitable [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. This is a “no regrets” adaptation option based on good land management actions that should be occurring to increase resilience regardless of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Applied burning or ecologically sensitive grazing may help to maintain, or even improve, grassland condition and maximise the chance for long-term persistence of a functioning, predominantly native, grassy ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Rather than reserves that no longer protect valued natural assets being de-gazetted [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], we suggest that these locations should be prioritised as being areas of highest resilience, and managed to facilitate change.
