<p class="p">Our projections of suitable climate for the dominant species, 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Poa labillardierei</italic>, suggest that the lowland grasslands may become a simplified version of the present community, with these structural dominants persisting in some areas, while other, more specialised species may decline. Given their current broad distributions and thermal tolerances, these species might be expected to disperse across the landscape into areas that become more climatically suitable in the future, and are likely to persist in other community types such as grassy woodlands or forests. However, in areas where the climate is projected to become less suitable for the dominant species, the potential for exotic species to invade is high [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Invasion success is higher when communities or component species are under climatic stress, such as during prolonged drought. Several species of exotic grass (eg. Serrated Tussock Grass, 
 <italic class="italic">Nassella trichotoma</italic>) are very successful invaders, and form dense, single-species stands. Once established, such monocultures exclude native species, altering the fire regime and functioning of the system [
