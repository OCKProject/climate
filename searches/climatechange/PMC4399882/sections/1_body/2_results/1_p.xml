<p class="p">The results are presented as maps of relative climate suitability for the current period (in grey), and the two future periods (2050 in pink and 2080 in red). Future climate suitability is shown as the sum of all areas projected to be suitable by any climate model, the bounding box (Araújo and New 2007, Porfirio et al. 2014). This is likely to be a conservative estimate of future declines in suitable climate, as individual models projected substantially smaller areas in all cases. Black indicates the areas where all climate models agree that currently suitable climate will persist by 2080 (“persisting climate”).</p>
