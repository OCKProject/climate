<p class="p">The area that is climatically suitable for the grass species 
 <italic class="italic">Poa labillardierei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) contracts over time, but substantial areas remain suitable for 5 of the 6 climate models. One climate model, MIROC3.2 (medres), projects a very small area remaining suitable for both species. This climate model is wetter and slightly cooler than the mean of all climate models in the CMIP3 archive. The projections for 
 <italic class="italic">Poa</italic> show stronger contraction than 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda</italic> over the same time period, although its current extent is substantially greater.
