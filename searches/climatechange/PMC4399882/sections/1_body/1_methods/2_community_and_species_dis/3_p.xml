<p class="p">Presence locations for each of the grassland communities were generated by randomly sampling 1000 points from within the existing distribution of each of the community types from the state-wide digital vegetation map, TASVEG3.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Although grasslands covered a larger extent prior to European settlement in the early 19
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, and preferential clearing may have occurred in the past on more fertile soils or areas with fewer trees, the remaining grasslands are distributed within the likely extent of the original, so sampling the current distribution is a reasonable approximation to the range of suitable climatic conditions.
