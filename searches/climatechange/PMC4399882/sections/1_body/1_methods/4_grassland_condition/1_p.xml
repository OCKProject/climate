<p class="p">Listing of the grassland community under the 
 <italic class="italic">EPBC Act 1999</italic> requires an assessment of grassland condition to identify the remnant patches of greatest conservation value. For this analysis, grasslands that met at least six of the seven criteria for listing of LNGT under the 
 <italic class="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</italic> were considered to be in good condition. These grasslands have been verified via field validation and/or aerial photo interpretation as meeting all of the criteria for listing (i.e. sufficient patch size, grass tussock cover, species type and woody plant cover) except for one criterion relating to minimum wildflower species richness. This criterion was not considered essential to qualify as being in good condition, because species richness in Tasmanian grasslands is often underestimated unless field validation is carried out in the peak flowering time.
