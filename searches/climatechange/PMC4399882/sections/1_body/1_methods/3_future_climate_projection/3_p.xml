<p class="p">Current baseline climate surfaces were obtained from ANUCLIM version 6.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], based on the 0.01° (~1 km) Digital Elevation Model for Australia. Climate change grids for maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax, Tmin), precipitation and pan evaporation were calculated relative to the ANUCLIM baseline (1976–2005; 1970–1995 for evaporation), for two future periods representing 2040–2069 and 2070–2099 (hereafter 2050 and 2080, the mean values of the 30 year periods). ANUCLIM was used to interpolate the regional climate model output to 1km and generate monthly mean data and the thirty-five bioclimatic variables for the current and future periods (
