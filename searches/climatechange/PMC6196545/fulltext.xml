We combined experiments and process-based modeling for analyzing the consequences of climate change on European maize yields if farmers made the best use of the current genetic variability of cycle duration, based on practices they currently use. We first showed that the genetic variability of maize flowering time is sufficient for identifying a cycle duration that maximizes yield in a range of European climatic conditions. This was observed in six field experiments with a panel of 121 accessions and extended to 59 European sites over 36 years with a crop model. The assumption that farmers use optimal cycle duration and sowing date was supported by comparison with historical data. Simulations were then carried out for 2050 with 3 million combinations of crop cycle durations, climate scenarios, management practices, and modeling hypotheses. Simulated grain production over Europe in 2050 was stable (&#x02212;1 to +1%) compared with the 1975&#x02013;2010 baseline period under the hypotheses of unchanged cycle duration, whereas it was increased (+4&#x02013;7%) when crop cycle duration and sowing dates were optimized in each local environment. The combined effects of climate change and farmer adaptation reduced the yield gradient between south and north of Europe and increased European maize production if farmers continued to make the best use of the genetic variability of crop cycle duration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>yield</kwd><kwd>flowering time</kwd><kwd>management practices</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">EC | FP7 | FP7 Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology (KBBE)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100011262</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">FP7-244374</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Boris Parent</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Claude Welcker</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Fran&#x000e7;ois Tardieu</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001665</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">ANR-10-BTBR-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Boris Parent</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Sebastien Lacube</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Claude Welcker</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Pierre Martre</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Fran&#x000e7;ois Tardieu</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">none</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Mikhail Semenov</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001665</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">ANR-11-INBS-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Boris Parent</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Sebastien Lacube</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Claude Welcker</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Pierre Martre</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Fran&#x000e7;ois Tardieu</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Most projections relying on process-based (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) or statistical models (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) predict that climate change will reduce yields of most crop species. Indeed, crops will experience more heat events, dry weather, and an increase in evaporative demand which may all decrease crop production (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, some species still show yield progress in farmer&#x02019;s fields despite observed climate changes (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the fact that many impact studies assume unchanged farmer&#x02019;s genotypes and practices, whereas farmers continuously adapt crop cycle duration and sowing dates to local environmental conditions (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The comparatively few studies of climate change impact that consider adaptation of management practices (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) predict a decrease in yield by 1&#x02013;6%, smaller than without adaptation (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Furthermore, a study that considers adaptation of sowing date and cycle duration for six crops predicts a yield increase of 12&#x02013;16% (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This diversity of projections led us to develop a more explicit approach based on experiments and process-based modeling and to use a precise definition of adaptation involving biological variables and management practices currently used by farmers.</p><p>The duration of crop cycle (<italic>i</italic>) is largely affected by climate change through increase in temperature; (<italic>ii</italic>) has a major effect on crop yield via cumulated canopy photosynthesis; and (<italic>iii</italic>) presents a large genetic variability in most species, in particular via the genetic control of flowering time that involves networks of genes that interact with environmental conditions (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This raises the possibility that farmers can counteract the effects of climate change by making the best use of the genetic variability of flowering time (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), thereby adapting phenology to climate changes as it has been the case over centuries in natural ecosystems (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This raises the questions of whether (<italic>i</italic>) farmers can access an organized genetic variability of cycle duration to adapt crop cycle to a range of environmental conditions; (<italic>ii</italic>) one can model the decision rules that farmers currently use for adapting cycle duration over environmental gradients, together with sowing dates; and (<italic>iii</italic>) adapting crop cycle duration can counteract the effects of climate change. More specifically, we have questioned whether the decision rules currently used by farmers to adapt crop cycle duration over environmental gradients would reduce the impact of climate change on European maize production.</p><p>Addressing these questions required an experimental approach for the first question, a model of farmer&#x02019;s decision rules together with a comparison of model outputs with European statistics for the second question, and a crop simulation model that explicitly accounts for the genetic variability of flowering time and of crop responses to environmental conditions for the third question. We combined multilocation field experiments that analyzed the consequences of the genetic variability of crop duration, historical yields, crop management and phenology information, and projections of midterm climate change impacts. These were performed for European maize, whose flowering time is a constitutive trait, depending on temperature but independent of photoperiod sensitivity or cold requirement.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>The Existing Genetic Variability of Cycle Duration Allows Optimizing Yield in a Wide Range of Current Environmental Scenarios.</title><p>We first tested whether the current genetic variability of cycle duration allowed identification of an optimum cycle duration that maximizes grain yield in each site.

Overall, if the effect of climate change was synthesized by weighing irrigated and rainfed fields over Europe, the total maize production increased by 4.5% and 7.0% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, if the crop cycle was adapted, in the likely hypothesis of a moderate increase in TE.</p><p>The combined effects of climate change and of adaptation of crop cycle duration were much larger in northern than in southern locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>C</italic>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic></xref>).

Here, we have considered adaptation via one biological process, the use of the observed genetic variability of flowering time, and explicit management practices, sowing date, and irrigation, considered with rules that mimic those currently used by farmers. This was in the line of Lobell (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) who considered it essential to precisely identify the actions (adaptation) that affect the impact of climate change and of Rezaei et al. (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) who proposed that climate change impacts should not rely on a single-cultivar concept. Furthermore, we have based our approach on experimental evidences for evaluating the effect on yield of the genetic variability of flowering time and on comparisons with historical data for testing the farmer&#x02019;s decision rules used in crop simulations. This has also required an improved crop simulation model that can predict the effect of the genetic variability of phenology and of responses to environmental conditions on leaf growth, grain set, and transpiration (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), together with advanced phenotyping techniques for establishing the model (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).

We can consider this hypothesis as reasonable because (<italic>i</italic>) genetic resources and alleles for adapting crop cycle duration have been identified and are increasingly available (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); and (<italic>ii</italic>) farmers have already adapted maize varieties in recent years, as they have done for wheat in the United States for over a century (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).

In simulations, we considered one single optimum for all studied years, simulating the fact that farmers can estimate frequencies at each site but cannot forecast climatic conditions for adjusting decisions to individual years.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Simulations and upscaling.</title><p>The climate scenarios in 2050 were simulated at each site by using the stochastic weather generator LARS-WG (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and were based on climate projections from the CMIP5 ensemble with RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (487 and 541 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> in 2050, respectively) and six GCMs, namely GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-MR, CMCC-CM, and MIROC-ESM. The respective positions of these GCMs are compared in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1720716115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9</ext-link> to 18 GCMs from the CMIP5 ensemble in terms of changes in precipitation, VPD, relative humidity, and in mean temperature calculated over land in Northern and Southern Europe. In Southern Europe, GFDL-CM3 is the hottest and nearly the driest GCM from the CMIP5 ensemble. One-hundred years of daily weather data were generated for each combination of site, RCP, and GCM.</p><p>A total of 2,897,136 crop simulations were run (for the baseline period: 2 managements &#x000d7; 2 irrigations scenarios &#x000d7; 31 accessions &#x000d7; 59 sites &#x000d7; 36 y; for climate scenarios: 2 scenarios &#x000d7; 6 GCMs &#x000d7; 2 irrigations scenarios &#x000d7; 31 accessions &#x000d7; 59 sites &#x000d7; 30 y &#x000d7; 2 options for TE). To upscale results from sites to each country, simulated data under full-irrigation and rainfed scenarios were weighted for each site by the proportion of irrigated maize fields in the area from the JRC database, data originally from Siebert et al. (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1720716115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). Results were then averaged at country level. To upscale to European level, results at country levels were multiplied by the area of maize cultivation in each site, based on the 25 &#x000d7; 25 km grid cell of the Eurostat database on year 2010.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.1720716115.sapp.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Josiane Lorgeou (Arvalis) and Brigitte Gouesnard (INRA) for their contributions to the experiments.
