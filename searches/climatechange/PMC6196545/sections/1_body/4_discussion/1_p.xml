Here, we have considered adaptation via one biological process, the use of the observed genetic variability of flowering time, and explicit management practices, sowing date, and irrigation, considered with rules that mimic those currently used by farmers. This was in the line of Lobell (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>) who considered it essential to precisely identify the actions (adaptation) that affect the impact of climate change and of Rezaei et al. (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>) who proposed that climate change impacts should not rely on a single-cultivar concept. Furthermore, we have based our approach on experimental evidences for evaluating the effect on yield of the genetic variability of flowering time and on comparisons with historical data for testing the farmer’s decision rules used in crop simulations. This has also required an improved crop simulation model that can predict the effect of the genetic variability of phenology and of responses to environmental conditions on leaf growth, grain set, and transpiration (
