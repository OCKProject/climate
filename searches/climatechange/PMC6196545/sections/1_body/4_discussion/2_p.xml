<p class="p">Are farmers likely to use the genetic variability of flowering time and to adapt sowing dates by 2050? We can consider this hypothesis as reasonable because (

 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) farmers have already adapted maize varieties in recent years, as they have done for wheat in the United States for over a century (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). For example, varieties of the group midearliness dent lines were mostly grown in France at latitudes of 44.8–45.9° in 1996 while they have shifted to 46.5–47.5° in 2009 (

The same tendency for farmers to increasingly use late-maturing cultivars has also been observed in other species such as winter rapeseed and rye, thereby partly or fully compensating for the decrease in cycle duration linked to the increase in temperature (
