Further improvements of plant performance based on increased photosynthesis, adapted reproductive development, or resistance to pests and diseases will be necessary. Southern fields will have less of a competitive advantage in both irrigated and rain-fed conditions (

 </xref>), whereas farmers in northern areas will have the option of growing maize with high yields. This may change the maize growing area, in such a way that the positive impact of climate change on European maize production might be higher than predicted here.
