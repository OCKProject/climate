<p class="p">A total of 2,897,136 crop simulations were run (for the baseline period: 2 managements × 2 irrigations scenarios × 31 accessions × 59 sites × 36 y; for climate scenarios: 2 scenarios × 6 GCMs × 2 irrigations scenarios × 31 accessions × 59 sites × 30 y × 2 options for TE). To upscale results from sites to each country, simulated data under full-irrigation and rainfed scenarios were weighted for each site by the proportion of irrigated maize fields in the area from the JRC database, data originally from Siebert et al.
