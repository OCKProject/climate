<p class="p">Two watering regimes were simulated in each site, either rainfed or with systematic watering until field capacity over the entire soil profile every 3rd day. The optimums for each of these cultivation practices were calculated for each combination of site, year, scenario, GCM, watering regime, and option for TE. In simulations, we considered one single optimum for all studied years, simulating the fact that farmers can estimate frequencies at each site but cannot forecast climatic conditions for adjusting decisions to individual years.</p>
