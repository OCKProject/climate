<p class="p">Sowing dates were simulated in each field as the first day from January to May in which the frequency of frost was &lt;5% in the following 10 d (calculated over 36 y in each site). The same rule was used for the 2050 climate scenarios. Harvest date was simulated as occurring after physiological maturity, on the first day when soil water content of the 0- to 30-cm top layer was below 90% saturation. The latter rule simulated the impossibility for harvester machines to enter into the considered field because of an insufficient load-bearing capacity. The model simulated a total yield loss if harvest could not happen before November 1, due to the high risk of ear fall and diseases, combined with the necessity for farmers to sow the next winter crop at that time.</p>
