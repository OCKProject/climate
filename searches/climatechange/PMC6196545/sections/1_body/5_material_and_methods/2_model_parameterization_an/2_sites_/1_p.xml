<p class="p">We used 59 locations representative of the European maize growing area and of typical soil types of these regions. Fifty-five sites were those described previously (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>), representing the 10 European countries with the highest maize growing areas in the 2004–2009 period (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>) and the main maize growing regions within these countries (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Four sites were added to improve the spatial distribution of locations. Soil data were obtained from the Joint Research Centre (JRC) European Soil Commission database and from the Crop Growth Monitoring System (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Because soil depth can highly vary within each region and because the aim of this study was a sensitivity analysis on other variables, we considered a soil depth of 1.5 m in all sites. Meteorological data used for the baseline period were 36 y of daily weather (1975–2010) obtained from (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the AGRI4CAST database of the JRC for the 55 sites (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>) and (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) the INRA CLIMATIK database for the four added sites. The atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration was 380 ppm. For comparing predicted and observed current European yields, plant density and nitrogen supply were adjusted for each site based on the JRC database
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" class="xref">*</xref> and local knowledge. Because there is no reason to hypothesize that these values will stay the same in 2050, common sowing density of eight plants m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and no nitrogen limitation were used in the final set of simulations to compare the baseline period and future climate scenarios.
