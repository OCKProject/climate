<p class="p">We used the model APSIM maize (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>) modified for expansion of individual leaves (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>) and calibrated (in particular for responses to water deficit and VPD) with data of the reference hybrid B73xUH007 in replicated field experiments in Mauguio, France (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>) and in the phenotyping platforms PhenoArch and Phenodyn (

Temperature at 3-h time step was calculated from daily minimum and maximum temperatures with the third order polynomial function used in APSIM maize (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). VPD was calculated for each 3-h time step based on current temperature and daily minimum temperature, an estimate for dew-point temperature. Leaf expansion rate was calculated every third hour, based on values VPD and soil water status with parameters as in ref. 
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>. The parameter representing TE before correction by the effect of VPD (parameter transp_eff_cf in APSIM maize) was set at 0.0075 g kPa g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the baseline period and increased by 0.1% per additional μmol CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resulting in +11% and 17% in 2050 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (
