<p class="p">A set of virtual hybrids with contrasted crop cycle durations was derived from the reference hybrid, in which crop cycle duration depended on the duration of the vegetative stage. The duration of the vegetative period was driven by the final leaf number (ref.

The durations of each phenological stage of the vegetative period were affected proportionally to changes in time from emergence to flowering. All other parameters were those of the reference hybrid (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Hence, the 16-leaf hybrid was the reference hybrid and hybrids with leaf number ranging from 11 to 30 were similar to the reference hybrid but with different final leaf number.
