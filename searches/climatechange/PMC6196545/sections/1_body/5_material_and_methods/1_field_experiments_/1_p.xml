<p class="p">We tested a panel of 121 maize accessions representative of main components of the maize genetic diversity (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>) in three experimental fields with two watering regimes each. Sites included a Mediterranean field, Mauguio [43°36′37′′N; 3°58′39′′E; 23 m above sea level (asl)], and oceanic sites in Sainte Pexine (46°33′43′′N; 1°08′17′′W; 45 m asl) and Le Magneraud (46°24′16′′N; 00°04′45′′E; 26 m asl). In each site, two water regimes were imposed, with either irrigation over the crop cycle or restricted irrigation with soil water deficit at flowering time. A rainout shelter was used in Le Magneraud to ensure water deficit so the number of accessions was 57 because of the limited available space. Irrigation was withdrawn at the eight-visible-leaf stage, until flowering time plus 10 d but was still applied when plants showed leaf rolling in early morning for 2 consecutive days. The experimental design was an alpha lattice with two replicates in the irrigated treatments and three replicates in rain-fed treatments. Plots were 6 m long, with 0.8 m between rows and a plant density of 8 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Light, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were measured every hour in each experiment at 2-m height over a reference grass canopy. Soil water potential was measured every day at 30-, 60-, and 90-cm depths in watered and rain-fed plots with three and two replicates, respectively. Mean soil water potential was −0.3 MPa on average during water deficit in Sainte Pexine and Le Magneraud, and was −0.6 MPa in Mauguio. Thermal time was calculated from sowing time as in APSIM maize (
