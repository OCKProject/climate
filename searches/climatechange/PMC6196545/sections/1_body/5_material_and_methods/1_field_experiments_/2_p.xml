<p class="p">Emergence, flowering time, yield, and yield components were assessed at plot level. The length and width of every second leaf and leaf number were measured in 10 plants per plot. The leaf appearance rate of each accession was calculated by dividing the mean thermal time at flowering time by the final number of leaves of the studied accession. The duration of the vegetative period was expressed as final leaf number in

 </ext-link>. We then averaged data for accessions with common final leaf number. Leaf area and light interception were calculated every day from sowing to harvest for all accessions. For that, profiles of final leaf length and width for each variety with final leaf number from 11 to 25 were obtained from measured data. The time of appearance of each leaf was calculated from the phyllochron. Leaf expansion was considered linear during 10 d from leaf appearance (
