 </ext-link>), with values that were similar for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 because flowering time was earlier in the season for RCP8.5, thereby compensating for the limited difference in temperature between RCPs at a common date. For the same reason, water deficit during flowering time was similar in 2050 compared with the baseline period 1975â€“2010 if TE was considered as unchanged because the earlier flowering time compensated for the negative effect of VPD increase (
