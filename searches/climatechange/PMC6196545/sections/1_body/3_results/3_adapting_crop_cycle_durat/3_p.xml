<p class="p">As in previous climate impact studies, a decrease in yield was simulated in rainfed fields between the baseline period and 2050 under the hypothesis of unchanged varieties and sowing dates (RCP4.5), with a negative effect in 70% of rainfed fields (

 </xref>). This negative effect was maximum at latitudes 43–47° N that represent the major growing area for maize. Conversely, simulated yields tended to increase in well-watered fields at latitudes higher than 47° N due to increased light intensity around flowering time (

 </ext-link>). Overall, upscaling these results for Europe as a whole across latitudes resulted in a small effect on overall production in rainfed fields (−2% and +0.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) (
