<p class="p">We projected yields for 2050 by considering that the farmer’s decision rules presented above, based on the assumption of optimal practices, will apply in the future. We then compared the yields simulated with either adapted or invariant cycle durations and sowing dates. Daily local-scale climate scenarios for 2050 were generated by the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in 2050, respectively). For each RCP, we used six global climate models (GCMs) that cover the range and present similar mean values for changes in temperature, VPD, and precipitations compared with 18 GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble for the studied area (
