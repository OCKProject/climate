<p class="p">The projected impact of climate change became positive if one assumed that farmers will adapt cycle duration and sowing date by using the decision rules they currently follow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Optimal sowing dates were earlier by 10–39 d depending on sites in 2050 under RCP4.5 compared with the baseline period (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S12
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </ext-link>). The cycle duration of adapted varieties increased by 207 °Cd (degree days) for RCP4.5 in irrigated fields at high latitudes (&gt;49°), corresponding to an increase in leaf number by 3.4 (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S6 and S12
 </ext-link>). This increase disappeared in irrigated southern fields and in rainfed conditions because optimum durations were limited by the probability of negative effects of drought or heat stresses with later flowering time. If farmers followed these decision rules in 2050, the simulated impact of climate change would be positive in irrigated fields in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" class="xref">Fig. 4
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </xref>), regardless of hypotheses on TE and GCMs (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S11 and S13
 </ext-link>), with an effect that increased with latitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 </xref>) and was largely accounted for by the increase in intercepted light during the crop cycle (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S14
 </ext-link>). Adapting the crop cycle duration also had a positive effect in rainfed fields (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S11 and S13
 </ext-link>), but this effect was only observed if TE was considered as increasing with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and was GCM dependent. Overall, if the effect of climate change was synthesized by weighing irrigated and rainfed fields over Europe, the total maize production increased by 4.5% and 7.0% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, if the crop cycle was adapted, in the likely hypothesis of a moderate increase in TE.
