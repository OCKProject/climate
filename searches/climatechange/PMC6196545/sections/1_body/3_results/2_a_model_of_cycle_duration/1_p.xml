<p class="p">The above paragraphs suggest that, by trial and error, farmers and extension services might identify a cycle duration that maximizes yield in the most frequent climatic scenario corresponding to each site (“autonomous adaptation,” ref. 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). This has allowed us to model their decision rules about cycle duration, but also sowing date, and to compare simulation outputs to farmers’ practices reported in European databases (

 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). The simulation of cycle duration used by farmers at each site was based on the calculated optimum sowing-to-flowering duration presented above. Simulated sowing dates occurred on the first day of early spring for which the risk of frost for 10 d after sowing was lower than 5% over 36 y, thereby combining a minimum risk of plant damage with highest potentials of cumulated photosynthesis and yield. They ranged from March 20 to April 30, with later dates at northern latitudes. The spatial distribution of sowing dates and flowering times simulated in this way closely matched with those reported in the European AgroPheno database (
