 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the fact that many impact studies assume unchanged farmer’s genotypes and practices, whereas farmers continuously adapt crop cycle duration and sowing dates to local environmental conditions (

 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). The comparatively few studies of climate change impact that consider adaptation of management practices (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>) predict a decrease in yield by 1–6%, smaller than without adaptation (

 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Furthermore, a study that considers adaptation of sowing date and cycle duration for six crops predicts a yield increase of 12–16% (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). This diversity of projections led us to develop a more explicit approach based on experiments and process-based modeling and to use a precise definition of adaptation involving biological variables and management practices currently used by farmers.
