<p class="p">Addressing these questions required an experimental approach for the first question, a model of farmerâ€™s decision rules together with a comparison of model outputs with European statistics for the second question, and a crop simulation model that explicitly accounts for the genetic variability of flowering time and of crop responses to environmental conditions for the third question. We combined multilocation field experiments that analyzed the consequences of the genetic variability of crop duration, historical yields, crop management and phenology information, and projections of midterm climate change impacts. These were performed for European maize, whose flowering time is a constitutive trait, depending on temperature but independent of photoperiod sensitivity or cold requirement.</p>
