<p class="p">The duration of crop cycle (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) is largely affected by climate change through increase in temperature; (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) has a major effect on crop yield via cumulated canopy photosynthesis; and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) presents a large genetic variability in most species, in particular via the genetic control of flowering time that involves networks of genes that interact with environmental conditions (

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). This raises the possibility that farmers can counteract the effects of climate change by making the best use of the genetic variability of flowering time (

 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). This raises the questions of whether (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) farmers can access an organized genetic variability of cycle duration to adapt crop cycle to a range of environmental conditions; (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) one can model the decision rules that farmers currently use for adapting cycle duration over environmental gradients, together with sowing dates; and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) adapting crop cycle duration can counteract the effects of climate change. More specifically, we have questioned whether the decision rules currently used by farmers to adapt crop cycle duration over environmental gradients would reduce the impact of climate change on European maize production.
