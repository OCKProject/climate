 <p class="p">The consequences of climate change on European maize yields may become positive if farmers in 2050 use the decision rules they currently follow for adapting plant cycle duration and sowing dates to the diversity of environmental conditions. Experiments and simulations show that the current genetic variability of flowering time allows identifying a cycle duration that maximizes yield at every maize field in Europe. The assumption that farmers use this optimal cycle length in each site was supported by comparison with historical data. Simulated European production for 2050 was stable under the hypotheses of unchanged practices but was increased if farmers continued adopting the decision rules they currently use for adjusting sowing date and crop cycle duration to local environment.</p>
