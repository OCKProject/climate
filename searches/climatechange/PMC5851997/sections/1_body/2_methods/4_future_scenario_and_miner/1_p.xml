 </sup> (32–64 Gt over 87 years). We calculated the future scenario considered in this study (increased degrading peatlands in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) according to a Michaelis−Menten function describing the increase. The function was set to reach half saturation, i.e., a doubling of the current degraded area within 60 years after present day.
