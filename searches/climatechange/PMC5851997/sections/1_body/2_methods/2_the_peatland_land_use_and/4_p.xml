<p id="Par20" class="p">Inside each country we first assumed that all the cropland areas on peatland are fully degrading, and therefore all the CL areas have been assigned land degradation factor 1. We then calculated a degradation ratio (between 0, non-degraded, to 1, fully degraded) using the area of degraded peatland by country reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. In case that this degradation ratio was indicating a smaller area than what indicated by the cropland areas, we assumed the latter to be the correct estimate. In case, that the relative cropland land use on peatland was smaller than the degradation ratio for a specific country, we subtracted the cropland/peatland ratio from the degradation ratio reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup> and applied the remaining degradation ratio uniformly among all the other land use types.
