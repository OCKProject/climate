 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and dissolved organic carbon DOC in the overall calculation. Given the high uncertainty of the data we decided on a conservative statistical treatment. Uncertainty in the emission factors is considered as uniform probability distribution inside each of the three major classes (CL, FL, and GL), and uncertainty boundaries are therefore expressed as a range. The range considers explicitly maximum and minimum instead of confidence intervals. The resulting map shows the potential peatland distribution and spatially assigns potential GHG emissions from peatland degradation to the potential global peatland area (Fig.
