<p id="Par22" class="p">We multiplied the peatland degradation map (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) with the potential emission map to calculate a probabilistic map of actual emissions from peatland degradation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Total emissions are calculated on a per pixel base and then aggregated by climate and land use to produce data in Tab. 1. The peatland area reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>, and the cartographic data we assembled are statistically comparable (Spearman’s 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value 0.02). The peatland area reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>, which contributes to our degradation estimates with the fraction of degraded peatland per country, is distinctly smaller than the cartographic area depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> but it is assumed to be representative of the share of degrading peatlands at global scale. Given the generous estimate on which the original map from ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup> is based, since it includes in many areas (where data are missing) also histosols and gleysols, we rescaled the peatland areas on a global area estimate based on what is reported in the table from ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>, updated with the tropical area reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup> plus the area reported by ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>.
