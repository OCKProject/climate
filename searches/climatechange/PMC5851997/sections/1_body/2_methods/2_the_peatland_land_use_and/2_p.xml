<p id="Par18" class="p">We assigned peatland areas to the three major IPCC land-use classes (Forest Land FL, Grassland GL, and Cropland CL) by overlaying our map with the European Space Agency Global Land Cover Map (ESA-GLCM, release 19/12/2008), available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2008/12/Envisat_global_land_cover_map" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2008/12/Envisat_global_land_cover_map</ext-link> (accessed 21 Jan 2016). The ESA-GLCM raster distinguishes 23 classes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) that we reclassified with the IPCC emission factors and climate regions (boreal, temperate, tropical), associated with the three broad land-use types CL, FL, and GL
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Classes 11, 14, and 20 were assigned to CL, classes 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 110, 130, 160, and 170 were assigned to FL, and classes 120, 140, and 150 were assigned to GL. Class 190, associated with mixed urban areas, was assigned to GL. We assigned the mixed class 30 to a combination of the FL, GL and CL emission factors, and class 180 to a combination of FL and GL. Classes 200–230 could not be assigned to any land-use type and were disregarded. In order to improve land classification we combined to this source also CL areas from the EarthStat database

 </sup>. Since this map indicates the probability of the presence of CL between 0 and 1, we discretized it with a threshold of 0.5, considering all areas with higher probability as being CL. We then updated the former land use map by superimposing the CL classification to all these areas.
