<p id="Par21" class="p">Degradation refers to drainage, the latter being a precondition for further management. We alternatively use both drained and degraded, based on the premise that drainage (i.e., a human activity) is a precondition for management which always induces peat degradation (i.e., a changing ecosystem property) as indicated by changing GHG fluxes (i.e., the measure for degradation). We generated this way a degradation map with values between 0 and 1 expressing the (probabilistic) fraction of degraded peatland in that area (Supplementary Fig.Â
