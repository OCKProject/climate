<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we begin by revisiting data on global peatland distribution and degradation, then analyze current and future GHG release and its uncertainty from degrading peatlands (neglecting peat fires). This provides a global estimate of the magnitude of possible GHG savings for organic soils, assuming that peatland restoration renders a GHG neutral ecosystem. We compare this potential to management-induced organic matter accumulation in mineral soil and assess both pathways from the perspectives of C and N cycling, time, and land demand. Our analysis assigns higher GHG emissions to degraded peatlands than previous reports, mostly owing to a larger area of managed organic soils in the tropics. Cumulative GHG emissions from already drained peatlands are greater than mineral soil carbon sequestration potentials on all agricultural land. Restoration of degraded peatlands provides an efficient mitigation measure in the land-use sector, owing to a smaller area and nitrogen demand when compared with mineral soils.</p>
