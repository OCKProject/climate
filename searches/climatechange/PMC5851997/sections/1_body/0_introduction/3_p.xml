<p id="Par5" class="p">A substantial fraction of anthropogenic GHG emissions could be compensated for by improving management of mineral soils. Indeed, various options for C sequestration, such as residue management and improved crop rotations in arable land or species introduction in grasslands, have been discussed (e.g., refs.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>). However, stoichiometric constraints limiting C storage are more severe in mineral soils compared to peatlands. In organic soils, mostly phenolic or lignocellulosic remains from mosses or vascular plants with low concentrations of N and other nutrients predominate. In mineral soils, microbial products with narrow C/N ratios are quantitatively dominant components of organic matter

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>, which makes C storage in mineral soil nutrient costly. C storage in peatlands is much less N limited: they accumulate organic matter over millennia, needing an average of only 0.018 kg N per kg C sequestered
