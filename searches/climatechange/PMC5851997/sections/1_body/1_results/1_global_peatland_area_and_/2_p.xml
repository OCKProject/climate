<p id="Par8" class="p">Depending on the quantity of C stocks, GHG emission factors, and contribution of C to the overall emission, a drained peatland continues to emit for decades to centuries. The ongoing organic matter loss will exhaust the actual degrading peat deposits within the next centuries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), depending on the intensity of the emissions and their C density. We calculated a N stock in tropical peat (intact and degrading) of ~4.0 Gt N, based on a median C/N ratio of 29.7 (Methods) and a tropical peat deposit of 119.2 Gt C. This latter estimate is based on our revised, high-resolution area assignment and comprehensive estimates on carbon stocks per area land in tropical peat

 </sup> suggests that the tropics might present still uncharted peat stocks, for example in the Amazon basin. Of this N in tropical peatlands, 1.7 Gt would be cumulatively released upon degradation of currently utilized tropical peatlands, together with 0.6 Gt N from currently degrading temperate, boreal, and polar peatlands (total N stock temperate + boreal + polar peatlands 9.8 Gt, median C/N 49.0

 </sup>). In reverse, these quantities of C and N stocks in degrading peatlands represent avoidable emissions during the calculated time span and become an asset upon restoration.
