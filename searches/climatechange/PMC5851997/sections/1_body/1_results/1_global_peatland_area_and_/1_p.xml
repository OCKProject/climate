<p id="Par7" class="p">Our maps of the peatland distribution (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) reveal a contribution of 83.3, 4.0, and 12.7% from the boreal (and polar), temperate, and tropical zone, respectively, to the total peatland area. Our area estimate of in total 463.2 Mha puts a higher weight on tropical peatlands compared with previous estimates (8–11%, refs.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>, classified by climate and land use, to the overall peatland area is considered a vulnerability indicator and illustrates that potential hot spots for GHG emissions are mostly located in the tropics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The global peatland area estimated as drained for forestry, cropland or grassland is ca. 50.9 Mha (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The distribution of actual and potential emissions differs substantially, particularly in the tropical zone of South America and Africa, indicating a low degree of degradation, whereas actual rates are closer to the potential ones in Southeast Asia and Europe, owing to their higher degree of degradation
