<p id="Par15" class="p">These insights into mitigation options in organic and mineral soils in terms of N and land demand, and time line do not call into question efforts undertaken in mineral soils, but indicate that, for effective climate change mitigation in the land-use sector at the global scale, both strategies must be adopted and that we must prevent further peatland degradation. Integrating significant peatland preservation and restoration measures in global policies, particularly in the tropics, therefore appears to be a critical step for an effective global climate change mitigation strategy.</p>
