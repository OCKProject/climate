<p id="Par12" class="p">Minimizing anthropogenic GHG emissions via peatland restoration is cheap in terms of N when compared with mineral soil C sequestration and thus more cost effective. Owing to their narrow C/N ratio of on average 10.7

 </sup>, N availability will represent a constraint to compensate for anthropogenic GHG emissions in mineral soil together with making such measurements more pricey. This can be illustrated by comparing the avoidable N release from currently degrading peatlands with the N requirement for mineral soil C sequestration; The latter would entail a total of 2.2–5.9 Gt N or, averaged over 63 years, 35.2–93.9 Mt N a

For perspective, with a quantity of 2.2–5.9 Gt N, global peatlands sequestered 81–216 Gt C. The additional N requirement for organic matter sequestration in mineral soils is substantial considering that 117 Mt N were applied globally as fertilizer in 2016

 </sup>, and stands in sharp contrast to halting emissions via organic soil restauration where no additional N must be fixed but quite the converse, release of 2.3 Gt N can be avoided. Taking the mean equivalence point of 238 years in the business as usual scenario of Fig.
