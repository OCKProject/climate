 </sup>. By integrating temporal dynamics instead of just comparing annual rates, we show that even in the case of successful full implementation of C sequestration measures in all 4923 Mha agricultural land on mineral soil, GHG emissions from only the 50.9 Mha of currently degrading peatlands would override that sink on a midterm time scale. Hence, the global perspective on soil-born GHG emissions reveals that a net mitigation cannot be achieved without including the organic soil option. In a scenario of further peatland exploitation, a positive global soil GHG balance, i.e., a net source, would likely be reached within the next one hundred years.
