<p id="Par14" class="p">Our comparative simulation of mineral soil C sequestration and GHG mitigation from organic soil underpins the high relative mitigation efficiency of peatland restoration and protection. The majority of utilized peatlands is located in the tropical (47% of the global total degrading area) and boreal+polar (32% of the global total degrading area) zones, followed by a relevant percentage of utilized peatland in temperate zones (21%), and many of these areas are managed at high intensity. A full recovery of these areas implies that the corresponding loss of production from agriculture and forestry should be compensated by an increased productivity on mineral soil. Paludiculture allows for maintaining a non-intensive land use, but cannot fully replace food production. However, the 50.9â€‰Mha of degrading peatlands represents only ~1% of total agricultural land. Under the assumption that productivity on degrading organic soils is similar to that of mineral soil

 </sup> and that all of them were agriculturally used, it is unlikely that the environmental impact of increasing productivity per land unit on mineral soil by 1% overrides the detrimental consequences of continuous peatland use listed here.
