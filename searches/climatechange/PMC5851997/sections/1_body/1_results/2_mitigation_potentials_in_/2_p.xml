 </sup> for calculating sequestration potentials of agricultural mineral soils and, within our simulation, the maximum additional C storage of 24–64 Gt C in 4923 Mha mineral soil would be reached after 63 years (Methods). We did not consider any increase of the current agricultural area, since any land-use change would imply net GHG release from newly converted areas. Our calculation suggests that, in a hypothetic scenario in which substantial peatland restoration is not incorporated, comprehensive mineral soil measures alone would only be able to compensate for most of the future emissions from degrading organic soils but not provide a net soil sink. A detailed look into the time line of emissions reveals that, because of the high-annual GHG release and the size of the peat C pool, the equivalence point after which cumulative mineral soil C sequestration becomes counterbalanced by cumulative GHG emissions from degrading peatlands would be reached after on average 238 (140–1021) years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This will apply even if sequestration strategies were implemented at full capacity in mineral soils and considering that no additional peatland areas would be degraded. After this point, GHG emissions from soils would globally represent a net GHG source to the atmosphere. In a scenario of doubling peatland exploitation area gradually during the next six decades (Methods), the equivalent point would be reached after only 104 (67–374) years, and cumulative C and N release from that larger area would add up to 161.6 and 4.6 Gt, respectively.
