  <p class="p">The worldâ€™s cumulative GHG emissions from degrading peatlands. Cumulative emissions of the current area are in pink, and for a doubling of that area within 60 years (future scenario, see Methods) in blue (positive values). Their end points represent the theoretical maximum that can be emitted from the degrading peat C stocks. Units are Gt CO

   </sup> (gray). Vertical lines denote equivalence points where mineral soil sink potentials are exhausted relative to peatland-related emissions (minimum, average and maximum estimates, for numbers see text; maximum equivalence point for actual degrading peatland is 1021 years and not displayed)
