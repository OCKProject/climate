  <p class="p">Global peatland distribution and annual potential emissions from peatland degradation. The colored area indicates the areal distribution of peatlands globally. Legend colors refer to per hectare greenhouse gas emissions if those peatland would be drained. High potential emissions are associated with intensive land use and warm climate, low potential emissions with low land-use intensity in cold climate</p>
