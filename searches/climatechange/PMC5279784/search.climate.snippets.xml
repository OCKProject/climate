  <result pre="use of analogies to highlight seven key decision-relevant elements of" exact="climate" post="change, including uncertainties about when and where serious damage"/>
  <result pre="occur, its unprecedented and progressive nature, and tradeoffs in limiting" exact="climate" post="change. An internal meta-analysis was then conducted to estimate"/>
  <result pre="two studies. Analogies were not found to inform knowledge about" exact="climate" post="literacy facts. However, results suggested that people found the"/>

  <result pre="future of climate change. One is to improve understanding that" exact="climate" post="change presents various risks, many of which cannot be"/>
  <result pre="must still be considered. Education for this objective teaches that" exact="climate" post="science has produced a mixture of solid knowledge and"/>
  <result pre="practical choices, including their policy preferences, in the face of" exact="climate" post="change and its uncertainties. This is education for what"/>
  <result pre="about the Unknowns of Climate Change If the goal of" exact="climate" post="change education is to create a public that is"/>
  <result pre="conveyed is that risk and uncertainty are both inherent in" exact="climate" post="change. Treating the topic as one in which decisions"/>
  <result pre="based on established facts alone creates a mistaken impression of" exact="climate" post="change risks. It also allows any attack on ideas"/>
  <result pre="ideas portrayed as established fact to support the view that" exact="climate" post="science is fundamentally in doubt, justifying inaction. People need"/>

  <result pre="climate facts and of uncertainties: both what is known about" exact="climate" post="change and what is potentially important, but uncertain. Many"/>
  <result pre="uncertain. Many of the outcomes that motivate preemptive action on" exact="climate" post="change most strongly (and are subject to the most"/>
  <result pre="to the most intense debates) involve uncertain possibilities in the" exact="climate" post="future. Informing decisions does not imply bringing the beliefs"/>
  <result pre="debates. This goal has been elusive in the U.S.A., where" exact="climate" post="change is a highly polarized issue [ 3, 12–"/>
  <result pre="This polarization can undermine even the most promising methods of" exact="climate" post="science communication [ 17]. It may prevent people from"/>

  <result pre="A multitude of mental models could be used to explain" exact="climate" post="change. We focus on three that capture some key"/>

  <result pre="Many medical diseases have decision-relevant attributes analogous to those of" exact="climate" post="change: the risks are often caused or aggravated by"/>
  <result pre="decision. This analogy is invoked implicitly by some opponents of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation, who justify their position on the ground"/>
  <result pre="puts people in the mindset of judging the existence of" exact="climate" post="change rather than considering options for action. However, it"/>
