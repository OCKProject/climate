<p class="p">Informing decisions does not imply bringing the beliefs of the public into line with any particular policy agenda. Differences of opinion are to be expected in dealing with any kind of risk. The goal is to support better-informed discussions and debates. This goal has been elusive in the U.S.A., where climate change is a highly polarized issue [

 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and people tend to retreat to their own echo chambers when hearing and talking about it [

 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. It may prevent people from hearing about—and considering—the full range of proposed responses to climate change. Fully informed citizens, like climate policy experts, may well have differences of opinion and come to different conclusions about how best to proceed [

 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The goal of decision support is to help members of the public arrive at policy preferences and decisions that reflect the realities of the problem, even if their preferred solutions vary. Although evaluating success in this arena is trickier than assessing understanding of climate facts, people can report their understandings of key decision-relevant attributes of climate change.
