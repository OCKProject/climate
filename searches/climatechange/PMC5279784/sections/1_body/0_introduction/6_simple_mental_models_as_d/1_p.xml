<p class="p">Simple mental models in the form of analogies may help convey these difficult ideas about climate change. Cognitive psychology research suggests that a good simple model should (1) be factual and not misleading, (2) use a familiar domain to explain the unfamiliar, (3) be novel enough to capture interest, and (4) allow for correct extrapolations based on understanding of the known domain [

 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Many such models have been used to help explain climate “facts.” For example, the analogy of Earth to a greenhouse makes it understandable why the planet’s surface temperature is so much higher than the temperature in outer space and identifies the role of atmospheric gases in retaining solar heat. Another simple model, comparing the atmosphere to a bathtub, helps explain the cumulative nature of carbon emissions [
