<p class="p">Two statements related to anthropogenic climate change formed a composite (Element 1): “The climate is changing” and “Climate change is caused in large part by human activities” (α = .77). The idea that climate change is progressive (Element 2) was assessed with the item “Climate change will get worse if we don’t do something about it.” Element 3 was measured with the statement, “Climate change is hard to reverse.” The statement, “Climate change may cause catastrophes, such as storms, floods, and wildfires greater than ever seen before” captured the idea that climate change will cause extreme unprecedented events (Element 4). The uncertainty of climate change’s exact effects (Element 5) was measured with the item, “It is difficult to predict when and where serious damage from climate change will occur.” Beliefs about tradeoffs (Element 6) were assessed with two items: “The things that people do that cause climate change also promote human comfort and convenience” and “Stopping climate change would be very disruptive to society.” A composite of these two items was considered, but they did not form a reliable scale (α = .26), and thus were analyzed separately. Finally, Element 7—the importance of mitigation (rather than just adaptation)—was assessed with the item “It is important to reduce the causes of climate change because that reduces all the negative effects—other actions only deal with one effect at a time.”</p>
