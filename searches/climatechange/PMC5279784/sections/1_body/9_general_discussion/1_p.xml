<p class="p">We identified seven decision-relevant attributes of climate change on the basis of a priori analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. We examined perceived helpfulness of the analogies, and their effects on climate “literacy” measures, beliefs about the extent of scientific consensus, and policy preferences related to climate change. Our main interest was in the effects of characterizing climate change via simple mental models using analogies from familiar contexts involving decision making under uncertainty that might make several key decision-relevant attributes of climate change more accessible. Our hope was that analogies that embodied these key attributes would better enable people to recognize these elements of climate change, and thus better comprehend the phenomenon, think through the risks it might present, and develop a more solid basis for making personal and political choices. Across the two studies, we found some evidence that the medical analogy was judged as helpful by respondents across ideological divides and increased individuals’ (particularly conservatives’) recognition of these decision-relevant aspects of climate change, though these effects were weak.
