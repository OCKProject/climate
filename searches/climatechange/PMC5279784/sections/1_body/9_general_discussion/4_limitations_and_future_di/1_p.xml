<p class="p">As noted earlier, the overall effect sizes we observed were fairly small according to traditional guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and most did not reach statistical significance in Study 2 or the internal meta-analysis. Power analysis using an expected 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> of .20 and with the desire for 80% power to detect a significant effect requires approximately 250 participants in each condition. Given these small effect sizes, future research in the area may require larger samples, at least if using null-hypothesis significance testing and not considering just effect sizes. Furthermore, if the differences in statistical significance between Studies 1 and 2 were, as we conjecture, due to the times of year and political environment in which they were conducted, future attempts to replicate climate change messaging should consider controlling for, or even more closely studying, these factors.
