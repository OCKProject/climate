<p class="p">Another limitation of the current study was our use of an online convenience sample. Some of our findings were in line with those of nationally representative samples [

Yet future studies should test whether the effects of analogies used in these studies replicate when used in more representative samples.

Alternatively, the medical analogy could be useful in real-world settings where it could be presented in even more detail, interrogated, and deliberated. For example, this analogy could be used in the type of face-to-face conversations that have been sometimes shown to be remarkably effective at political persuasion [
