<p class="p">Participants who failed the reading comprehension check were removed from the dataset (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 47); only the remaining 353 participants are included in the following analyses. A disproportionate number of participants in the TA condition failed the reading comprehension, leaving fewer in that condition (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 76) than in the other conditions (MA = 96; DA = 89; control = 92). All missing data for the remaining participants were deleted pairwise. As shown by the degrees of freedom for each regression in Tables
