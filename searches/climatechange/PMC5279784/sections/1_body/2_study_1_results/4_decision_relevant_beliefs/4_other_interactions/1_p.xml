<p class="p">Despite the predominant findings that the MA condition x ideology interaction was most predictive of decision-relevant attributes, the interaction between ideology and assignment to the TA condition also predicted a few outcomes. Simple slope tests revealed that these interactions were also driven by conservatives and moderates. Conservatives in the TA condition reported greater belief in unprecedented consequences of climate change (Element 4: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.54, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(346) = 2.87, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01) but also in the comfort and convenience of carbon-emitting behaviors (Element 6a: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.47, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(346) = 2.54, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01). Being assigned to the TA condition also led conservatives and moderates to believe less strongly in the uncertainty of climate consequences (Element 5: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">Con</sub> = -0.74, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(345) = -3.67, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001; 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">Mod</sub>. = -0.37, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(345) = -2.73, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01), and more strongly that mitigation would be needed to reduce the full set of risks (Element 7: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">Con</sub> = 0.80, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(346) = 4.24, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001; 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">Mod</sub>. = 0.26, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(346) = 3.48, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001). No interactions emerged between ideology and assignment to the DA condition.
