<p class="p">Meta-analysis was conducted with the STATA 14 [
 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] metan command. All effects were translated into Cohen’s 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>s, either through relevant 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>s and 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic>s (comparisons of the main effect of the medical analogy vs control condition) or the 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-values associated with regression predictors (either the relevant interactions or simple slopes). Standard errors were then computed for these effect sizes, and weighted, pooled effect sizes were generated across the two studies for each relevant set of analyses. We used random-effects models given the desire to generalize beyond the current samples [
 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. We used Cohen’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0171130.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] guidelines for the interpretation of effect sizes; 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = .20 is considered a small effect size, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = .50 is a medium effect size, and 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = .80 is a large effect size.
