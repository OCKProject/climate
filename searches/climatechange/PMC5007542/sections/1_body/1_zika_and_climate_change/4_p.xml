<p class="p">Although it's a combination of reasons that explains the current Zika virus outbreak, including movement of people and interruption of mosquito eradication campaigns (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pan American Health Organization, 1997</xref>), there are reasons that aspects of climate change, warmer wetter weather and flooding, may be contributing to the crisis (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kahn, 2016</xref>). First, mosquitoes flourish in warm humid climates, defining their range based on temperature and moisture (

 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barrera et al., 2011</xref>). Once requirements to outbreak initiation and other disease dynamics are in place, mosquitoes can then introduce diseases to populations that otherwise would have been safely out of reach. The distribution of the

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2016</xref>). It should be noted that temperature change can affect the development rate and transmission rate of disease in the cold-blooded mosquito (

 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barrera et al., 2011</xref>). Female mosquitoes require blood for reproduction. Mosquitoes may feed more frequently with higher temperatures. There is also the potential for the mosquito to be alive longer while infectious, thus having more time to transmit the disease (
