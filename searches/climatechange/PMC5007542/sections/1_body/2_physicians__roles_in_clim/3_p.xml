Physicians, as trusted medical advisors, health educators, and community leaders, can reach and educate large numbers of individuals on the health risks or effects associated with climate change. This is a critical component in the efforts to prevent adverse medical effects caused or intensified by environmental conditions attributable to climate change. As health risks increase from climate change, physicians will find themselves on the front lines of patient care for those that are affected by it. If physicians only treat individuals and fail to understand some of the causes for those individual care challenges, then opportunities are missed from a policy and regulatory level to get at some of the larger causes of these problems.
