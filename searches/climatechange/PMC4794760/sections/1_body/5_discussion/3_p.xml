<p class="p">To reconstruct the temperatures during the LGM we used a global model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>, with an estimated age of 21 ka BP. However, the growing consensus is that the glacial maximum (defined as the maximum extent of the ice cover) occurred earlier in the Iberian Peninsula than in the rest of Europe, at ca. 50 ka BP
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. This should not affect our conclusions, as the estimated absolute range of temperature differences remains the same and the increase in the transition time between glacial and interglacial can only lower the rates of change.
