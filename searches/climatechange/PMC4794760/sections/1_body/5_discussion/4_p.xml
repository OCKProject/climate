<p class="p">As a direct consequence of the stability of the subterranean environment, the reconstructed minimum change of thermal tolerance experienced by the studied lineage through their evolutionary history (approximately ±5 °C) was surprisingly low. Even so, this may have been enough to cope with climate change in the last ca. 18 MY. If species maintained a window of thermal tolerance, or a range of phenotypic plasticity, wider than these ±5 °C, a possibility is that they did not experience the need to adjust to climatic changes. Thermal tolerance experiments with some of the species of the studied lineage suggest that this may be the case

The upper limit of this range (20 °C) would be above the maximum temperatures that any of the species of the clade may have experienced since the Miocene. This lack of adjustment to local temperature was interpreted as a result of the loss of costly regulatory mechanisms due to the extreme conditions of the deep subterranean environment
