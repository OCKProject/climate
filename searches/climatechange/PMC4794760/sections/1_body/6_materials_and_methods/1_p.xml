<p class="p">We focused on a well-defined clade of troglobitic beetles of the tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera, Leiodidae) living in the North-eastern Iberian Peninsula (from the Pyrenees to the coast of Catalonia; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>), including 85 species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Note that we defined our “species” as monophyletic units, which in some cases include lineages within non monophyletic species, subspecies or more than one species when one of them occurs in a single cave to increase the sample size for modelling purposes (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The studied clade was reconstructed to have a highly modified life cycle
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref> and all species have the typical troglobitic morphological characters (i.e. they are blind, apterous, depigmented and with elongated appendages)
