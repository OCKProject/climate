<p class="p">For the estimation of the minimum accumulated change in temperature experienced through the evolutionary history of the lineage, we used ancestral trait reconstruction in BEAST, using as a quantitative trait the temperature of the cave in which each specimen was found (either directly measured or inferred from the annual average temperature of the locality; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">S3</xref>), and a multivariate diffusion model of evolution. We used three different measures: current temperature, the estimated LGM temperature, and the difference between the two (“range”) (see below). Analyses were run for 60 million generations, with a conservative burn-in of 10 millions. In all Bayesian analyses convergence was assessed with the effective sample size in TRACER 1.5. This reconstruction can be interpreted as the minimum amount of change in the thermal niche that the species should have experienced through their evolutionary history given the observed differences between species and the reconstructed topology.
