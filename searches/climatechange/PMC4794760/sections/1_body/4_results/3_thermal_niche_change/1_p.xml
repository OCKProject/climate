<p class="p">The mean rate of minimum absolute temperature change across all the branches of the tree was 0.76 °C/MY. The species that experienced the overall fastest minimum rate of absolute thermal niche change when considering only current conditions was 
 <italic class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</italic> (Fresneda, Hernando &amp; Lagar), with an average of 0.84 °C/MY (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). The branch of the tree with the highest absolute rate of thermal niche change was found in 
 <italic class="italic">Speonomus longicornis</italic> (Saulcy), with a rate of 3.62 °C/MY (from 9.42–8.2 °C in the last 0.33MY). The fastest rate of change when considering only a temperature increase was 2.28 °C/MY in a terminal branch of 
 <italic class="italic">Speonomus fagniezi</italic> Jeannel (from 10.9–12.9 °C in 0.87MY). When we considered the estimated LGM paleotemperatures of the areas currently occupied by the species, the maximum rate of thermal niche change was found in a population of 
 <italic class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</italic>, from 4.4 °C to 10.4 °C in the 21,000 years since the estimation used for the LGM (i.e., 0.029 °C/100 years).
