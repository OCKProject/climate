<p class="p">There is, however, one assumption that these species clearly violate, as they have a limited capacity for dispersal
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. They cannot be expected to occupy much of their suitable habitat at short time scales due to their reduced mobility, so their only possibility to cope with fast climate change is to persist 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>. This makes them a particularly well suited group to evaluate the effect of predicted global change, as they cannot accommodate to changing conditions by behavioural plasticity, microhabitat use or by migrating to more suitable areas.
