  <p class="p">The eight U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) regions in which the aerosol-CIs are computed. The CIs are computed using MERRA-2 daily-averaged output from all grid cells within the dashed lines enclosing each region. Note the Great Plains region has been divided into two regions to ease interpretation of the analyses. Abbreviations: AK = Alaska, NW = Northwest, SW = Southwest, GPu = upper Great Plains, GPl = lower Great Plains, MW = Midwest, SE = Southeast, and NE = Northeast. Also shown within the map are the locations of AERONET sites from which data are presented in FigureÂ
