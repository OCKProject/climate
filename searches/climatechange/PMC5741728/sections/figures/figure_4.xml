  <p class="p">Mean synoptic conditions for synoptic types associated with anomalously low and high AOD for each region (locations shown in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The mean temperature at 700 hPa (in K) are shown by the background colors, the solid black lines depict the 500 hPa geopotential isoheights (in m), and the red, magenta, cyan, and blue stippling represent 700 hPa specific humidity anomalies −2, −1, +1, and +2 standard deviations from the mean for all days. The arrows beside the panels indicate the presence and direction of significant trends in the PC scores associated with these synoptic types. The abscissa and ordinate axes are longitude (degrees East) and latitude (degrees North), respectively.
