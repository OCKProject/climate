<p id="Par9" class="p">Each aerosol-CI contains unique information about regional aerosol properties that have different implications for direct radiative forcing. These CIs also exhibit intra- and inter-annual variability and trends that are not consistent across indicators indicating the utility of all of the proposed aerosol-CIs to trend diagnostic and attribution analyses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). To detect potential redundancy in the aerosol-CIs, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. Although the aerosol-CIs exhibit co-linearity, the aerosol-CIs tend to fall primarily on orthogonal principal components, and the PCA indicates that there is not a coherent, physically consistent set of synthetic, comprehensive indicators across the different regions. Further, for a true climate impact to be realized, aerosol radiative forcing must be expressed over a large area. Thus, there is a need to understand and quantify the degree to which climate-relevant aspects of aerosol populations are regionally coherent.
