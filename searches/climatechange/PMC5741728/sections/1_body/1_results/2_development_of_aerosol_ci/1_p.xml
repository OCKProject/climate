<p id="Par8" class="p">AOD, AE, and SSA describe key aspects of aerosol particle populations that have greatest relevance to direct radiative forcing via aerosol-radiation interactions. Accordingly our proposed aerosol-CIs are based on daily values derived by averaging in space (i.e. over the NCA regional definitions shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and time, the hourly estimates of total column (anthropogenic and natural) AOD, AE, and SSA. The aerosol-CIs are thus daily mean AOD, AE, SSA and extreme (90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile (P90 AOD)) AOD, along with two key metrics of the spatial patterns of these variables: The daily global spatial autocorrelation value (characterized using Moran’s-I
 <sup class="sup">22</sup>; AOD-I, AE-I, SSA-I) and the range of spatial coherence as derived using semivariograms
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup> of daily AOD, AE, and SSA fields within each region (AOD-SC, AE-SC, SSA-SC) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Moran’s-I quantifies the degree of spatial clustering in the field and semivariograms quantify the distance at which two locations become independent. These ten aerosol-CIs are designed to track evolution of regional aerosol populations in terms of the overall aerosol columnar burden, average aerosol diameter, relative proportions of absorbing versus scattering aerosols, and the regional consistency of the spatial patterns of those properties.
