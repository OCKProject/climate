 </sup>, the majority of synoptic types associated with large positive AOD anomalies in each region exhibit a significant positive trend in PC scores. Conversely, synoptic types associated with negative AOD anomalies exhibited trends that are divided between increasing and decreasing trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). While there is evidence that some cool, dry days are also becoming cooler and drier, the dominant signal in this analysis is thus that synoptic types associated with elevated AOD are evolving to become more intense, i.e. warm, humid days becoming warmer and more humid. These changes in the synoptic-scale climate may thus partially offset emissions reductions

 </sup>. While the intensity of the synoptic types has changed, the frequencies of individual synoptic types over each region do not exhibit significant temporal trends over the period 2000–2015.
