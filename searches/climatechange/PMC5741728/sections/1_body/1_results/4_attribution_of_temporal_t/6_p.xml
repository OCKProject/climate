<p id="Par20" class="p">Despite reductions in anthropogenic aerosol precursor gas emissions, it is worthy of note that primary aerosol emissions exhibit a significant trend only in the NW, GPu, and MW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), and that biogenic VOC, dust, and wildfire emissions exert a substantial impact on aerosol burdens and optical properties

 </sup>. For example, there is a clear peak in extreme AOD in the spring of 2011 in the GPl, MW, and SE when wildfire burned area in the GPl was approximately four times greater than any other year (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In the GPl, the lack of association (i.e. lower correlation coefficients) between annual anthropogenic emissions and extreme AOD in three of the four climatological seasons and the observed decreased SSA may also be in part due to increased abundance of dust aerosols, consistent with remote sensing measurements that indicate increased dust-related absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) over the central U.S.

 </sup>. The declining trend in AOD in AK is also not very strongly linked to changes in anthropogenic emissions, but there is a significant positive association between extreme summer AOD and wildfire burned area (r = 0.96). This is clearly evident in 2004, 2009, and 2015, when positive excursions in monthly burned area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) coincide with spikes in summer extreme AOD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
