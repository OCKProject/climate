<p id="Par19" class="p">Consistent with policy enacted under the U.S. Clean Air Act that has resulted in declining anthropogenic pollutant emissions over the study period, regionally integrated emissions of key aerosol precursor species, sulfur dioxide (SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>), exhibit a significant negative trend for all eight NCA regions over the period 2000–2015. Further ammonia (NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) emissions exhibit a negative trend in all regions except the MW and NE, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions exhibit a negative trend in all regions except the NW and SE (Figure 5)

 </sup>. Consistent with this, mean and extreme AOD significantly decreased in GPl, MW, SE, and NE, and seasonal extreme AOD decreased in the fall in GPl, summer and fall in MW and SE, and spring, summer, and fall in NE. The overall tendencies in aerosol-CIs, including the significant decrease in mean and extreme AOD over GPl, MW, SE, and NE, are thus consistent with a decrease in sulfate aerosol abundance due to the reduction in SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (e.g., correlation coefficients between annual SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and extreme summer (except GPl) and fall AOD are &gt;0.57 over these regions). Congruent with this decline in SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, the annual deviations from the overall cumulative distribution functions (cdf) imply that almost the entire probability distribution of AOD has shown a shift towards lower values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Further, because sulfate has a high SSA (near unity)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>, a reduction in secondary sulfate aerosol would also contribute to the observed decline in regionally-averaged SSA. Reduced production of sulfuric acid may also lead to a reduction in mean aerosol diameter, implied by the increase in AE, due to a reduction in condensational growth. While historic trends in black carbon (BC) emissions are highly uncertain (e.g., from biomass burning), it is estimated emissions from mobile sources, the largest BC source in the U.S., decreased by 32% from 1990–2005 (ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>). Further, BC only contributes to ~4% of global AOD
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. Thus changes in SSA are likely not due to changes in anthropogenic BC emissions. Secondary organic aerosols are also a substantial component of aerosol mass and AOD over much of the eastern U.S.

 </sup>. Thus an additional contributory factor to declining AOD in these regions is the reduction in anthropogenic VOC emissions and secondary organic aerosol formation. Accordingly, the correlation coefficients between annual VOC emissions and extreme summer and fall AOD in the NE and MW are &gt;0.61. Thus, consistent with prior research, historical temporal trends of AOD across much of the contiguous U.S. are strongly responsive to emission reductions associated with the Clean Air Act.
