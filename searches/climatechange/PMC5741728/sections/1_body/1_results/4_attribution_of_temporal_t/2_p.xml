 </sup>. Consistent with that research, in each of the NCA regions, a number of synoptic types (i.e. repeated meteorological patterns) derived in a PCA of MERRA-2 meteorological output are associated with 10–20% AOD anomalies (positive and negative from the mean) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The link to meteorological conditions at the synoptic scale is less pronounced for AE (the anomalies are &lt;10%) and it appears SSA is relatively insensitive of the prevailing meteorological conditions (no synoptic type had a regionally average SSA anomaly of &gt;2%). This finding re-emphasizes the complexity of aerosol populations and their related climate forcing, and highlights the importance of having multiple aerosol-CIs in order to fully characterize changes in climate-relevant aerosol properties.
