<p id="Par22" class="p">The decrease in the spatial autocorrelation in AOD (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) along with the decreased anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions in each region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) indicates an increasing influence of local sources on sub-regional aerosol concentrations and thus increased grid cell–to–grid cell variability in aerosol populations. Conversely, scales of spatial coherence (distance at which grid cells become independent) are increasing, which may be linked to changes in synoptic scale conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). High and low AOD are generally associated with warm, humid and cool, dry conditions, respectively. The positive trend in PC scores for synoptic types associated with high positive AOD anomalies indicate a tendency towards intensification of meteorological conditions associated with large direct aerosol radiative forcing that may be offsetting some of the effects of emission controls. As climate conditions continue to evolve, this highlights the critical need to better understand the feedbacks between climate and aerosol populations.
