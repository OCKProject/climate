<p id="Par15" class="p">Attribution of observed trends in the aerosol-CIs, particularly deconvoluting changes resulting from changing anthropogenic emissions, natural emissions, and atmospheric conditions is critical to demonstrating the effectiveness of emission reduction policies, exploring and prioritizing potential climate change mitigation strategies, and making projections of possible future values of the aerosol-CIs. Thus, the aerosol-CIs for the NCA regions are examined below in the context of these key drivers of aerosol populations.</p>
