<p id="Par7" class="p">The release of the MERRA-2 dataset constitutes the first real opportunity to develop and apply aerosol-CIs for the U.S. NCA regions, or any other part of the globe. Aerosol properties in the MERRA-2 reanalysis product are derived in part based on assimilation of AOD at 550 nm derived from remotely sensed properties such as spectral reflectances, solar and instrument geometry, cloud cover, and surface features into the Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS-5) model

 </sup> (see Methods). MERRA-2 has been subject to extensive evaluation relative to independent observations, and thus only limited additional evaluation was undertaken as part of this study and is focused on evaluation of the joint probabilities of the key variables considered herein: AOD, and AE and SSA relative to those from ground-based measurements of columnar aerosol properties from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations
