<p id="Par13" class="p">Mean SSA and SSA-SC decreases are observed in all eight regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). There are also decreases in SSA-I for all regions except SE where there were significant increases in SSA-I, although the significance of the trend is lower in GPl (p-value = 0.06) and AK (p-value = 0.16). It is noted that SSA is determined by the aerosol composition and the dynamic range of SSA in MERRA-2 is lower than observations

 </sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>); therefore the aerosol-CIs that relate to SSA must be viewed with caution in the current reanalysis product. However, these trends are consistent with a tendency towards a relatively more absorbing aerosol, thus reducing the net cooling from aerosols. Further, the trends in SSA-I and SSA-SC imply aerosol populations are becoming more spatially heterogeneous in terms of the relative contribution of absorption to total radiative extinction.
