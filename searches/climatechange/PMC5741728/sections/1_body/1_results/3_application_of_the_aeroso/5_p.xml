<p id="Par14" class="p">When applied to the U.S. NCA regions, the aerosol-CIs thus indicate substantial evolution of aerosol populations through time in ways that are relevant to regional climate forcing. Overall aerosol burdens have declined (2000â€“2015) and on average aerosol populations have changed to become more dominated by smaller diameter and more absorbing aerosols. They are also evolving in a way that causes a decrease in spatial autocorrelation, but increases in spatial coherence.</p>
