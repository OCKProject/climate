<p id="Par10" class="p">Consistent with previous research, mean and extreme (P90) AOD declined in virtually all NCA regions over the period 2000–2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Significant (hereafter α = 0.05, unless otherwise indicated) decreases are observed in five regions: the lower Great Plains (GPl), Midwest (MW), Southeast (SE), Northeast (NE), and Alaska (AK), but increased mean and extreme AOD is observed for the Northwest (NW), and there was no change in the Southwest (SW) and upper Great Plains (GPu). To examine trends in AOD, AE, and SSA across their respective probability distributions (c.f. to only mean and extreme values in the CIs), Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–c</xref> shows the cumulative distribution functions (cdf) in each region for 2000–2015, as well as, the deviation from the mean cdf for each individual year. The direction of change and the presence of significant trends are consistent for mean and extreme (P90) AOD in all regions, but the magnitude of the change is larger for extreme AOD, indicating a narrowing of the AOD probability distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Significant regional AOD trends are ~1% year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while the magnitude of the extreme AOD trends are 1.2–1.4% year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in regions of decreasing AOD and 1.9% year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the NW (Figs 2, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, and S2). There is marked seasonality in some regions in terms of both the magnitude of and temporal trends in the aerosol-CIs. For example, extreme (P90) AOD significantly decreased in summer (the season of highest historical values), spring, and fall in NE, summer and fall in SE and MW (p-value = 0.06 for MW summer), and during fall in GPl. Conversely P90 AOD increased in summer and fall in NW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>).
