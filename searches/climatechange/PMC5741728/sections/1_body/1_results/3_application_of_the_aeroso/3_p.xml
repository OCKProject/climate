<p id="Par12" class="p">Mean AE significantly increased across all eight regions, indicating a decrease in mean particle size (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). This shift to higher AE is observed across the probability distribution, implying a shift in fine mode aerosols to smaller sizes, as opposed to a relative increase in fine versus coarse mode aerosols (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). However, trends in the spatial metrics of AE are not uniform across the regions. Significant negative trends in AE-I are observed in NW, SW, GPu, MW, and AK (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), but only two regions exhibited significant changes in AE-SC and they showed different signs (increased in SW and decreased in NE). Thus, there is evidence that as the aerosol populations are, on average, decreasing in diameter at the regional scale, but there remain sub-regions within many of the NCA regions with high coarse mode concentrations (e.g., across all days, 50% of grid cells have AE ≤ 1.2 in the NW, SW, and GPu; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), possibly due to wind-blown dust events
