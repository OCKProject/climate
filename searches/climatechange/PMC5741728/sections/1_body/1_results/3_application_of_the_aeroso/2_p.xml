<p id="Par11" class="p">The key utility of including two indices of spatial structure of the fields is illustrated by the divergent trends in these two aerosol-CIs. All regions exhibit decreased AOD spatial autocorrelation (AOD-I), but increased AOD spatial coherence (AOD-SC) is observed over the NW, GPl, MW, SE, and AK, and decreased AOD-SC is observed in the SW (p-value = 0.07), GPu (p-value = 0.15), and NE (Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Causes of these differences and the inter-annual variability in the aerosol-CI trends are discussed below.
