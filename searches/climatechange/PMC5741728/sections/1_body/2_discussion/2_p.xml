<p id="Par24" class="p">The aerosol-CIs presented herein are designed to be useful in tracking changes in climate relevant aspects of the aerosol population and to assist in diagnosing the causes of changes in aerosol populations at the regional scale. Their utility in the former regard is illustrated by application to the NCA regions, and specifically the finding that mean and extreme AOD and SSA is declining and AE is increasing over most of the U.S. consistent with a tendency towards lower aerosol burdens that are increasingly dominated by smaller diameter and relatively more absorbing aerosols. This implies a decline in the degree to which aerosols have offset greenhouse gas related warming of the climate over much of the contiguous U.S.</p>
