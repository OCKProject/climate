<p id="Par23" class="p">Use of climate indicators to represent key components of the climate system is an increasing focus of the U.S. NCA. For this reason, we advocate that aerosol-CIs are urgently needed to track a key aspect of the radiation balance of Earth, air quality, and biogeochemical cycles, and that aerosol-CIs should be generated and interpreted at the regional scale. The guidance for developing CIs is that they should be relatively straightforward to compute and readily evaluated in both the contemporary and possible future climate. Thus, the aerosol-CIs we propose can be readily derived for any gridded data set and therefore can be applied to any region using current and future generation reanalysis products and/or output from regional and climate models.</p>
