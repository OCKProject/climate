<p id="Par25" class="p">The aerosol-CIs are also defined using two geospatial metrics: Spatial correlation and spatial coherence. The former (Moran’s I) characterizes normalized co-variability and is a measure of the degree to which daily fields of AOD, AE, and SSA exhibit spatial clustering. The latter is a measure of the distance (range in the semivariogram) at which spatial fields become independent, and thus the extent to which the aerosol forcing can impact regional climate. The utility of these two spatial metrics in terms of diagnosing causes of changes in aerosol populations at the regional level is also indicated by the presence of divergent trends in AOD-I and AOD-SC in the NCA regions. These findings imply a tendency towards more grid cell–to–grid cell variability in aerosol populations, due to declining regional precursor and aerosol emissions leading to an increase in the relative importance of local emissions, within larger areas of increased spatial coherence (i.e. large range values from the semivariograms) in part due to an increase in the intensity of the predominant modes of synoptic scale meteorology.</p>
