<p id="Par26" class="p">Future work is needed to examine aerosol trends in global regions outside of the U.S. that are characterized by markedly different emissions and climate trends. Additionally, analyses of reanalysis products are only as good as the assimilation data and model used to develop the product. Thus the CIs should be applied to future reanalysis products that assimilate improved bias-correction assimilated data, data from additional, recently launched sensors, and more sophisticated model frameworks with improve aerosol treatment and emissions inventories.</p>
