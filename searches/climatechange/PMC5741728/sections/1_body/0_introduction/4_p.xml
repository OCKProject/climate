<p id="Par5" class="p">CIs must be predicated on high quality, uniform (gridded), and publically available data with well-defined provenance and an expectation that the variables on which they are based will continue to be measured into the future. Therefore observations, such as those from satellite- or ground-based remote sensing, are not suitable for deriving aerosol-CIs due to spatiotemporal discontinuities and a bias towards sampling cloud-free conditions

 </sup>. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of deriving the proposed aerosol-CIs from the first homogeneous, gridded reanalysis product that is constrained by satellite-based aerosol and meteorological measurements: Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2)
