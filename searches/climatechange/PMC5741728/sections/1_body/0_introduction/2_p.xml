 </sup>. In contrast to well-mixed greenhouse gases, as with other short-lived climate forcers, aerosols exhibit much higher spatiotemporal variability. Local primary aerosol and precursor gas emissions have a major impact on regional aerosol populations and thus climate impacts. Hence, quantifying the radiative forcing is challenging and subject to large uncertainties. For example, during 1980–2009, the global mean annual aerosol optical depth (AOD), a measure of the extinction of insolation by atmospheric aerosols and thus the reduction of radiation that reaches Earth’s surface, was unchanged (i.e. remained within ±0.01 of an estimated global average of ~ 0.15)

 </sup>. However, mean annual AOD decreased by up to 27% over parts of the U.S. and Europe due in part to regulation of precursor and primary aerosol emissions, while mean annual AOD increased by up to 22% over countries undergoing large economic development
