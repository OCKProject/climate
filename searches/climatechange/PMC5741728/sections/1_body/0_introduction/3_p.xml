<p id="Par4" class="p">In order to diagnose and track changes in key observable properties of the climate system through time, a number of climate indicators (CI) have been developed and applied

 </sup>. Many agencies that contribute to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) have developed and applied CIs to document and track changes in the physical, chemical, and anthropogenic (socio-economic) components of the climate system. The spatial or temporal resolutions of CIs vary widely: Some are global in scale while others are regional, and while some focus on the drivers of global change, others are more strongly focused on response variables. Existing USGCRP CIs thus include: Regional and global air temperature, precipitation, sea level, sea and land ice, and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, and fluorinated gases

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). We demonstrate how these aerosol-CIs can be used to quantify variability and temporal trends in aerosol populations, and attribute changes through time to specific drivers of aerosol variability: Gaseous precursor and primary aerosol emissions, and meteorological conditions at the synoptic scale.
