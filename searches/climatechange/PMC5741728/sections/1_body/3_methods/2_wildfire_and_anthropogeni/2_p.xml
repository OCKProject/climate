 </sup>. It is noted that there is inherent uncertainty in emissions estimates due to spatiotemporal variability in emission sources, measurement and sampling errors, and the simplification of modeled emissions processes. For example, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions rely on the sulfur content of the combustible material, biogenic emissions vary with environmental conditions, and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> emissions lack wide-spread regulatory restrictions and ambient NH
