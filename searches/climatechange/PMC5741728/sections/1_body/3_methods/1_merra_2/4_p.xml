<p id="Par30" class="p">Our analysis of the joint probabilities of AOD, and AE and SSA from MERRA-2 relative to AERONET, indicate good agreement, although MERRA-2 underestimates the dynamic range of AE and SSA (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Such underestimation is common when comparing gridded aerosol datasets that represent area means (~2,500 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for MERRA-2) versus 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> observations such as the pseudo-point measurements from AERONET. MERRA-2 reproduces the observed region-to-region variability in aerosol radiative properties and the MERRA-2 versus AERONET differences tend to be smaller than region-to-region differences (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>).
