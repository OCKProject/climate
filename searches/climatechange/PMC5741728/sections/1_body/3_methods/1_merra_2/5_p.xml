<p id="Par31" class="p">Physical variables from MERRA-2 used here within the synoptic-scale meteorological classification have also been extensively evaluated in the previous MERRA release. For example, the mean residual between MERRA and observations is &lt;0.5 hPa for Northern hemisphere surface pressures and ~&lt;1 K for temperature through the depth of the atmosphere relative to radiosonde measurements

Since the original MERRA reanalysis, the GEOS model has been further updated to reduce erroneous trends and discontinuities deriving from breaks in assimilated measurements, and to reduce biases in the water cycle. For all regions in the CONUS, MERRA-2 mean summer precipitation is within ~0.5 mm day
