<p id="Par29" class="p">MERRA-2 aerosol properties that are not directly assimilated have been compared to, and found to be in reasonable agreement with, satellite-based radiometric measurements. For example, monthly mean biases relative to the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) are typically &lt; |0.02| over the NCA regions, and MERRA-2 reproduces the aerosol vertical profile (e.g., height of peak attenuation backscatter) retrieved from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) over the continental U.S. (CONUS)

 </sup>. MERRA-2 has also been evaluated relative to near-surface measurements of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. Again the results indicate a relatively high degree of consistency with independent observations. For most months across the CONUS, MERRA-2 PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> is within one standard deviation of the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> measurements, although there is an underestimation of winter PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations over the northwest and northeast U.S., potentially due to lack of nitrate aerosols in MERRA-2 (ref.
