<p id="Par32" class="p">The advantages of using the MERRA-2 product for development of aerosol-CIs are manifold. These include use of a consistent data assimilation system for the entire period of record. However, any reanalysis system is subject to inherent uncertainties due either to assimilated variables and/or the model system. For example, an artificial trend exists in Terra radiances assimilated into MERRA-2, which may confound the trend analysis presented herein. Thus trends identified here should be further validated with future MERRA releases in which this trend is corrected and/or with other aerosol reanalysis products as they become available.</p>
