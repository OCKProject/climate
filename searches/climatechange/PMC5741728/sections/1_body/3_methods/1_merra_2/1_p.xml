 </sup>. It provides hourly, global gridded output of meteorological variables and aerosol optical properties including AOD, AE, and aerosol scattering extinction at 0.625° by 0.5° resolution. The aerosol characteristics are constrained using a wide suite of remote sensing products. For example, AOD at 550 nm is derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements on both the Terra and Aqua satellites (Collection 5)
