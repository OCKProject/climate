<p id="Par28" class="p">MERRA-2 output includes surface short- and longwave radiation fluxes, with and without clouds, and with and without aerosols, which could be used to estimate aerosol radiative forcing. However these properties are dependent on the radiative transfer model and treatment of aerosol optical properties within the reanalysis model. Thus, herein we only use observable variables that are more closely tied to the assimilated data.</p>
