 </sup>. Thus, PCA is used to derive a daily synoptic classification for all days in the study period and investigate the interaction between synoptic conditions and aerosol properties, and to determine the impact of meteorology on the CIs trends. Predictors used in the PCA are air temperature and specific humidity at 700 hPa plus 500 hPa geopotential heights from MERRA-2. The number of PCs to retain for each region was determined using a scree test

 </sup>. Between six and nine components (i.e. unique synoptic types) were retained for each of the eight NCA regions. The PC scores for each day (i.e. similarity to the major modes of variability as characterized by the PCs) are used to track changes in the frequency of each synoptic type (i.e. counts of days with highest similarity to each of the modes) and the intensity of the types (i.e. the magnitude of the scores for each PC). The mean anomaly of each aerosol-CI on all days classified by each synoptic type, calculated relative to the mean aerosol-CI computed for all days, is used to illustrate the importance of meteorological conditions at the synoptic (regional) scale in determining aerosol properties.
