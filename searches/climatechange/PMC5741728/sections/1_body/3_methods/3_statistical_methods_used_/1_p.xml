<p id="Par35" class="p">The aerosol-CIs we propose quantify the regionally-averaged mean AOD, AE, and SSA; extreme (90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile) AOD; and two geostatistical metrics of spatial autocorrelation and spatial coherence of AOD, AE, and SSA. The regionally averaged mean and P90 values are computed from hourly output that are aggregated in space and time to generate daily mean values for each property that then comprise each CI. While a spatial mean is used here, previous work indicates that spatiotemporal averages are sensitive to averaging methodology
