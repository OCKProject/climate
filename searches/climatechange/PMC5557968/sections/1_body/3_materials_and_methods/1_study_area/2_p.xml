<p id="Par20" class="p">There are three main headwater streams that supply water to the main stream, including the Aksu River, the Hotan River and the Yarkant River. These rivers feed the TRB at the Alar Gauge Station (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>) with the portions of water discharge 73.2%, 23.2%, and 3.6% measured at the Alar Gauge Station. In recent years, dam constructions and agricultural irrigation have had substantial impact on sustainable development of water resources in such arid regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> in the Supporting information). The socioeconomic development has led to a rapid change in land use in the TRB over recent decades (Fig.
