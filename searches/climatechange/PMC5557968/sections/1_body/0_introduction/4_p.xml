<p id="Par5" class="p">While various methods have been presented in literature to distinguish impacts of climate change on streamflow alterations from impacts of human activities, one approach widely used is to combine trend analysis with empirical statistical approaches, such as the Mann–Kendall test because of the simplicity

To improve our understanding of the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic factors on streamflow alteration in the TRB, this study aims: (1) to detect statistically variable trends and the change point in hydro-meteorological series; (2) to explore contributions and sensitivity of climate change and human activities to streamflow variability with the double mass curve method and the elasticity method based on the Budyko equations; and (3) to analyze elasticity of streamflow to precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and landscape.
