 </sup>. Ahn and Merwade (2014) analyzed climate and human impacts on streamflow conditions using historical streamflow records in Indiana, New York, Arizona and Georgia in USA, in conjunction with trend analysis and hydrologic modeling. The researchers reported that the human impact is higher on streamflow at most gauging stations in all four states compared to climate impact

(2010) reported a case study to distinguish impacts of climate variability and human activity on stream flow decrease in Miyun Reservior catchment over a period of 50 years using a distributed hydrological model and a climate elasticity model and reported that climate impact was accountable for about 55% while human activity (mainly manmade land use and vegetation changes) accounted for 18% of the decrease in reservoir inflow
