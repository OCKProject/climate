 </sup>. The objective of this study is to identify factors that caused streamflow alterations on the Tarim River, which is the longest continental river in the world, located in the arid area of north-western China. The Tarim River Basin (TRB) has been experienced water scarcity, resulting in conflicts among water consumers at upstream and downstream regions, and degradation of its natural ecosystems
