<p id="Par11" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> lists the elasticity of streamflow alterations on climate variables and human activities. During the post impacted period II, the elasticities of streamflow to 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 </sub> are 1.19 and −0.19 on average, respectively, indicating that a 1% increase in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> (or 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 </sub>) would increase streamflow by 1.19% (or decrease streamflow by 0.19%). The elasticity of streamflow to parameter 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> is −1.93 on average, implying that a 1% increase in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> would decrease streamflow by 1.93%. Our results show that streamflow alteration is the most sensitive to catchment landscape parameter (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>), followed by changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the TRB. Note that streamflow is positively correlated with precipitation but negatively with potential evapotranspiration and catchment landscape parameter.
