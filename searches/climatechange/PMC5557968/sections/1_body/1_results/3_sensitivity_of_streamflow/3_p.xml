 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the relationship between the climate and landscape elasticity with the aridity index and the landscape parameter using the Choudhury equation. The precipitation elasticity in our study area ranges from 1.00 to 1.53 and the potential evapotranspiration elasticity ranges from −0.53 to 0.00, while the landscape elasticity changes from −3.03 to −0.09. Results suggest that climate and landscape elasticity showed an increasing trend with the increase of aridity index. However, when the aridity index increased to 2.7, the climate elasticity shows a weakly increasing trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), the landscape elasticity remain increasing significantly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). It suggests that all elasticities in arid regions are more sensitive to runoff changes than humid regions.
