<p id="Par14" class="p">The temporal variations and spatial distributions of aridity index, precipitation elasticity, potential evapotranspiration elasticity and landscape parameter elasticity are respectively analyzed over nineteen stations as well as for the TRB. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, a significant increase from 3.90 to 37.89 occurred in aridity index from the upstream to the downstream in the TRB. Similarly, the elasticity of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and landscape parameter showed an obvious increasing trend. In particular, the landscape parameter elasticity ranged from −0.84 to −1.94 from the upstream to the downstream in the TRB. On the other hand, all the elasticities increased slightly while the aridity index decreased significantly.
