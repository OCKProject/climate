<p id="Par12" class="p">The elasticity coefficients estimated with the three Budyko equations show some differences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Precipitation change-induced streamflow increased from 1.044 for the Fu equation to 2.999 for the Budyko equation. The catchment landscape elasticity ranged from −1.975 for the Fu equation to −0.501 (Fu). It indicates that the elasticities in Budyko changes slightly from prior impacted period to post impacted period, while the elasticities between Fu and Choudhury equation are consistent with variation.
