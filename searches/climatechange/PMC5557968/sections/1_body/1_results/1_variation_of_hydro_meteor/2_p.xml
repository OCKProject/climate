<p id="Par7" class="p">The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt test were used to examine the trends in the annual runoff, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration series of 1960~2015 and determine change points of time series of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and streamflow at the Alar station (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The change points occurred in 1986 (p &lt; 0.05) firstly for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at most of Meteorological stations within the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Unlike precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, streamflow shows the change point in 1972 at a significance level of 0.081 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Meanwhile, the cumulative departure curve of streamflow illustrated the turning point for streamflow is 1972 in the Tarim river during the period of 1960~2015, while the turning point for streamflow is 1993, 1993 and 2000 in headstreams within the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The inconsistency between headstreams and mainstreams well reflects the fact that human activities have severely disturbed water distribution over time and space. The streamflow alterations were divided into three periods: the prior impacted period (1960~1972), the post impacted period I (1973~1986) and the post impacted period II (1987~2015). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> lists estimation of change points for precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow with the four methods. It can be seen that the four methods provide similar estimation for the change points. Streamflow alterations during the post impacted period were likely caused by human activities, such as irrigation and dam construction
