<p id="Par10" class="p">Quantitative estimation for contribution of climatic change and human activity to streamflow alterations is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Note that a positive percentage value represents a beneficial impact that increase streamflow while a negative percentage value is for negative impact which decreases streamflow. The results of three Budyko equations showed that climate change accounted for −20.68~−23.75% and human activity for 123.75~120.68% during the post-impacted period I. During the post impacted period II, contribution of climate change to streamflow alteration increased to −90.14~−128.68%, while the negative impact of human activity on streamflow alterations increased to 228.68~190.14%. Similarly, The DMC indicated that contribution of human activities accounted for 144.60% of the total deduction in the streamflow during the post impacted period I and for 140.38% during the post impacted period II (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Apparently the Budyko and DMC methods leads to a consistent conclusion that human activity played a major role in streamflow deduction during the post impacted periods. In addition, climate change contributed a positive impact on streamflow in the TRB likely because increase in temperature caused more snow melting which were accumulated at the mountainous areas (Fig.
