<p id="Par15" class="p">Our results conclusively reveal that human activity was the dominant factor to streamflow alteration in the TRB during the post impacted period I and both climate change and human contributed to streamflow alteration during the post impacted period II. Moreover, the elasticity of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and landscape parameter showed a significant increasing trend from prior impacted period to post impacted period II, and streamflow is more sensitive to landscape parameter. That is to say, along with the intensification of the human activity, the impact of it became more dominant in the alteration of streamflow.</p>
