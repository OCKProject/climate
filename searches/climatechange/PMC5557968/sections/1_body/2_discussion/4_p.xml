<p id="Par18" class="p">In view of the slow and partly uncontrollable influence of climate-induced changes, effective measures should be taken to restrain impacts of human activities on streamflow alterations in order to restore ecological integrity in the TRB. Three suggestions could be followed. The first suggestion is to restrict human activity to a reasonable range. The policy of reasonable allocation of water resources in the TRB can be implemented to alleviate conflicts between the upstream and downstream regions. Reservoir operation should ensure water release and storage capacity of aquatic ecosystems and maintain the ecological integrity. The second suggestion is to design an integrated modeling framework by combining groundwater planning and management together, providing guidance to recover the hydrological pattern in the TRB. The third suggestion is to establish demonstration zones at local levels to obtain experiences for water resources management and utilization and then expanded to the whole basin.</p>
