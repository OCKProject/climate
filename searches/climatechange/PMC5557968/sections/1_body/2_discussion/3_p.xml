<p id="Par17" class="p">Climate variability is an important factor to streamflow alteration. The uneven distribution of rainfall, evaporation and temperature variation may affect the temporal and spatial characteristics of water resources. In fact, the present study indicated that the change point of climatic variables in the TRB is 1986. Temperature and precipitation increased significantly and potential evapotranspiration showed a decreasing trend. Further investigation can be focused on climate change effects on snow accumulation (thickness) and snowmelt mechanism in the TRB.</p>
