<p id="Par16" class="p">As for human activity, cultivated area expansion and agricultural irrigation, dam construction are the respective factors in the TRB. Oasis agriculture is the principal economy in the basin and agricultural water consumption accounts for a large proportion of the total water consumption. Therefore, changes in cultivated land area can prove the extent of human impacts on water resources. Land use and cover change can describe the impact of oasis extension and agricultural irrigation on streamflow clearly. The farmland, forest land and residential land increased heavily while the grass land decreased. It implies that some parts of grass land transformed into mudflat and reed land farmland, forest land and residential land (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> in the Supporting information). Compared with 1980, the area of farmland, forest land and residential land increased by 51.84%, 19.53% and 40.14% in 2015, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). In contrast, the area of grass land decreased 4.81%. The dramatic change indicated that the demand of agricultural irrigation from oasis extension was obviously deleterious to water high-efficiency and reasonable utilization of water resources. In fact, oasis water consumption has been persistently increasing from 1960 to 2011 in the TRB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2c</xref> in the Supporting information). Moreover, the government statistics show that the area of actual irrigation exceeds area of government-allowed irrigation by as much as 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> hm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. It indicates that more and more ecological water is consumed for the excessive expansion of irrigated area and agricultural water consumption is still climbing at an alarming rate despite the gradually improved water use efficiency and reformed irrigation management. Meanwhile, reservoir construction has become great challenges for the sustainable development of water resources in the TRB. Currently, the 76 plain reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 2.8 × 10

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> affect natural runoff distribution and change the flood peak discharge. For example, to satisfy the ecological and agricultural water use in the mainstream in the TRB, water managers regulated the streamflow in the low-flow period by implementing water conservation projects. Plain reservoirs are shallow with a relatively large water surface, thus leading a large amount of evaporation in the arid area. In addition, water seepage losses is huge for unlined irrigation canals and soil-based reservoirs, resulting in waterlogging and salinization due to the raise of the groundwater table. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2b</xref> shows that water consumption taken from the three great plain reservoirs during 1981 to 2006 were significantly increased. However, the ratio of water consumption of three plain reservoirs in total water consumption showed a decreasing trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2a</xref> in the Supporting information), it indicates that other ways of water consumption played a more dominant role in the alteration of streamflow. Therefore, it is unequivocally clear that a total amount of decreased water resources within TRB in the past half century have been mainly utilized for implementing water conservation projects and expanding irrigated areas. The eco-environment with TRB has been deteriorating in recent years, especially in the downstream of the basin. Signs of deterioration in the eco-environment warm us that human activities including irrationally water resources utilization have exceeded the environmental carrying capacity, and even destroyed the integrity of the natural ecosystems.
