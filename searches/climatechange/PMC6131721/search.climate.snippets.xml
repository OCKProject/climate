  <result pre="License. Abstract This article focuses on the social aspects of" exact="climate" post="change and explores the interrelationship between belief systems and"/>
  <result pre="belief systems. The aim was to determine those challenges regarding" exact="climate" post="change adaptation that are caused by a community’s belief"/>
  <result pre="and to make recommendations to overcome them. Diverse perceptions of" exact="climate" post="change and beliefs from three townships in the North-West"/>
  <result pre="internal processes is very helpful. Discourses on belief systems and" exact="climate" post="change adaptation are prompted by the discrepancy between scientific"/>
