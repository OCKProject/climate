<p class="p">Naïve scientific explanations of climate change can be held next to more traditional views. Participant 04-RM-Ventersdorp explains climate change as caused by people in factories which cause a lot of ‘smokes’ that then ‘leads to increased heat’ but also by ‘that something that stays in the river, that I will not be able to say it by name’. Beliefs that are seen as contradictory are either changed or arranged in a hierarchy. Participant 01-RM-Ventersdorp used to believe that climate was natural and controlled by God but says that he changed these beliefs because he now believes climate is controllable. Participant 03-KM-Jouberton says that she does not ‘undermine anything’ and ‘do believe that … smoke pollutes air’, but she ‘believe(s) mostly in God’.</p>
