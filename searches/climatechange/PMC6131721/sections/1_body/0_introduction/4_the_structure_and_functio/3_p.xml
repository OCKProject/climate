Lying at the centre of a belief system and regulating the organisation of more peripheral beliefs, control beliefs represent a person’s authentic commitment. Data background beliefs are those beliefs held about devising theory and data beliefs are the theory itself. Loubser (
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:13) looks at the organisation of beliefs and distinguishes between pre-theoretical, theoretical and combination structures. An example of a structure that is both theoretical and pre-theoretical is a paradigm. According to Rokeach (
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:124), pre-theoretical structures can be held either consciously or subconsciously. Control beliefs and data background beliefs both fall into this category, whereas data beliefs are theoretical (and conscious).
