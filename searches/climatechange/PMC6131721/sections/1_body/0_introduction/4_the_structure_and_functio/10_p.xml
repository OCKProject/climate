 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:383) stated that interaction with an object or situation is largely determined by beliefs about it. Regarding climate change, the fundamental view one has about nature and society, including social interactions, help determine one’s risk perception of it (McNeeley &amp; Lazrus 
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>:506). Foundational beliefs about the relationship between God, humankind and nature influence both perceptions of climate change and the categories for solutions, because it affects who we blame. It affects how we value ecosystems, nature and human dignity and how we judge humanity’s purpose and destiny (Hulme
