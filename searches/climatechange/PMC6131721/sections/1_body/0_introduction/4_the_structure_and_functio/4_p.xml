<p class="p">Not all beliefs are equally important (Wyer &amp; Albarracín 
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:276). The most central and therefore connected beliefs are axiomatic and derive directly from object encounters; these are also the minimum guarantee for stability and include basic beliefs such as person, object and self-constancy (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:7). Connectedness and importance or centrality of beliefs are correlated, although both intensity and verifiability stand independent of centrality (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:5,13). Shared beliefs (beliefs held by many others as well) and existential beliefs are central, and so are beliefs that spring from direct experience (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:6). Non-primitive beliefs are distinguished from primitive ones as those that differentiate as one matures to round out one’s world picture ‘realistically and rationally to the extent possible, defensively and irrationally to the extent necessary’ (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:9). Rokeach also identifies authority beliefs, which are beliefs about positive referents that a person trusts to have the correct information. These beliefs are determined by social structure, education and experiences, and also include negative referents, which are seen as having incorrect information.
