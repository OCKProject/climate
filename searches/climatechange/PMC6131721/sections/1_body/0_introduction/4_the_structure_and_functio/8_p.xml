<p class="p">Beliefs are built on values according to Thagard and Findlay (
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:331), who explain global warming critics’ trust in the free market, property rights and technology to encourage environmental responsibility and solve global warming on their underlying values of liberty, economic stability and technology. Values are cognitive constructs that lie at the core of our conscious beliefs (O’Brien &amp; Wolf 
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:3) and are decisive factors in designating causality (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1979</xref>:2). Values are abstract and idealistic. A hierarchical organisation of values is learned and acts as a guide in conflicts between different end-state existences or modes of behaviour (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:124,161; 1979:2). They form a unifying structure for beliefs by maintaining attitudes, guiding actions and moral judgements, and justifying oneself and others’ behaviour throughout different situations (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:160). It is a prejudgement and sometimes emotionally charged, which explains why evidence might not be sufficient for change (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:131). In these terms, values can be equated to Wolterstorff’s authentic commitment: a person’s authentic commitment or control beliefs are the guide by which all new information is structured and it gives meaning to information. A worldview can be said to have the same function, as it categorises the world and relationships in it (Loubser
