<p class="p">Knowledge beliefs are organised via concepts into conceptual systems (Thagard 
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>:20–21). According to Hernes (
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:113) if one belief changes, it can cause a rearrangement of the whole network, because constructs of causal relations are logically linked, whereas Rokeach (
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:2–3) warns that these connections are not necessarily logical. Inconsistencies sometimes only become apparent with the realisation that a new belief causes a logical contradiction, or when there is no specific compartment for a new belief (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:117–118). In this case, either the belief, view or commitment will be revised (Wolterstorff 
 <xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1976</xref>:88). Unnoticed inconsistencies within a belief system can be explained by either compartmentalisation or ‘an uncritical internalization of contradictory values and attitudes’ (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:167–168). Consistency is most important within our self-esteem framework and only then according to logic and reality (Rokeach 
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>:164).
