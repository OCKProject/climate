<p class="p">Beliefs are created for a purpose and therefore have motivational roots (Wyer &amp; Albarracín 
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:306). If an emotional charge accompanies a belief, it will be used often and more easily (Marsh &amp; Wallace 
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:11). We tend to follow the path of least resistance in these very dynamic frameworks, and an emotion-induced rejection of best explanation (Thagard &amp; Findlay 
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:342) can be this easier route. One is also prone to infer certain propositions according to a completion principle (Wyer &amp; Albarracín 
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:287), as uncertainty is unfavourable in a coherent framework.
