<p class="p">Natural adaptive responses have developed in the form of indigenous resource management (Berkes 
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>:159), but as environmental changes become more pronounced, humankind’s relationship with their environs evolve (O’Brien &amp; Wolf 
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:233–234,237). Accumulated indigenous knowledge is fast becoming obsolete, or at the very least vastly insufficient, in this fast changing landscape. Paired with an ever increasing population growth, additional problems such as loss of biodiversity only confirm the bleakness of the situation (Ensor &amp; Berger
