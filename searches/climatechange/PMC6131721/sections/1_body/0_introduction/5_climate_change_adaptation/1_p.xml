<p class="p">Climate change adaptation in social systems is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:5) as ‘the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities’. Eriksen et al. (
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>:2) define climate change adaptation as reducing climate’s adverse effects on well-being and health, while seizing opportunities from the climatic environment. The amelioration of negative consequences together with the utilisation of opportunities seems to saturate most definitions of adaptation. Adjustment includes systemic, behavioural, as well as internal cultural and personal changes (O’Brien &amp; Hochachka 
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:2). Change can be threatening, and unless it is internally accommodated and prepared for, it may very well be resisted (Ensor &amp; Berger 
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:33).
