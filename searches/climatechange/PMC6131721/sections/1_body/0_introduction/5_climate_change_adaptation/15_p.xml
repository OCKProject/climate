<p class="p">A lack of access to resources and very little say in policies that control these resources cause poor communities to struggle with mediating climate change (Ensor &amp; Berger 
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:2). Mediation is, however, also influenced by the perception of opportunities and impact, which are influenced by information management, capacity to learn and motivated stakeholders (Ensor &amp; Berger
