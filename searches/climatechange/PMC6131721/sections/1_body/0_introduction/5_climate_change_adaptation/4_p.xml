<p class="p">The United Nation’s International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) defines vulnerability as ‘conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes, which increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards’ (Birkman 
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:12). Psychological factors are arguably included under social factors, but intentionality is missing from this definition (Wisner 
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Wisner et al. (
 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>:11) propose ‘characteristics of a person or group and their situation that influence their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of a natural hazard’. This definition shifts the focus to non-physical attributes. O’Brien and Wolf (
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:232) stress that vulnerability is determined in large part by how changes are appraised. Birkmann (
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:39) puts vulnerability as internal risk factor at the core of a widening concept of vulnerability, increasing in scale and complexity. At the core, it is strategically positioned to cause a ripple effect. Of course, both internal and external aspects are relevant, but it does appear that internal aspects are neglected in official definitions.
