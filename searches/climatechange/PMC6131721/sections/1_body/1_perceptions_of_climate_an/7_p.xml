<p class="p">When it comes to the interpretation, there are different perspectives on the data set (Watts &amp; Stenner 
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:81). Things like setting up the final Q-set and interpretation of the factors can almost be seen as an art, but the analysis of data is technical and objective. It consists of the following five stages: creating the correlation matrix, factor analysis, determining factor loadings for each Q-sort, factor rotation and finally the calculation of factor scores and difference scores (Van Exel &amp; De Graaf 
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:8â€“9). The factor score leads to a composite or idealised Q-sort for each factor. The Difference scores leads to the identification of distinguishing statements. The factors, which are interpreted into summarising accounts, represent operant clusters of subjectivity (Van Exel &amp; De Graaf 
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:1) and in this way people, not tests, are correlated.
