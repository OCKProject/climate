 <p class="p" xmlns="">God is in control of everything and he created the climate (it is not affected by traditional healers or fighting of the ancestors). Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with the climate, it is natural and unpredictable. Our behaviour has no influence on it, but we have to respect the environment. It was better in the older days and returning to those ways (living closer to nature and others) might improve the situation. At the same time, I do believe technology can have an influence. I also strongly believe that young people can teach older people about the climate. I am open to change my beliefs and learn more.</p>
