 <p class="p">God is in control of the climate, but we as humans have a big influence on it: fossil fuels and pollution are related to climate change. It is a problem, because climate influences our crops and food production – it plays an important role in our lives. The climate was better when I was younger and the next generation will have it even worse than we do today if we don’t do something about it now – it is not the government’s responsibility. To change beliefs is difficult. I am convinced of my beliefs and the only way that I will change it is if I see proof to the contrary. Climate change may be a sign that the world is ending but maybe we can fight it with technology.</p>
