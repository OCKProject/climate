 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), we had hypothesized a decline in biodiversity in response to climatic changes for the KA‐NP. However, our in‐depth analyses revealed that climate change effects on forest biodiversity in mountain forest landscapes can be both positive and negative, depending on the indicator and species group assessed. This finding corroborates other studies showing divergent effects among taxonomic groups and exemplifies the existence of a considerable variation in local‐scale biodiversity trends (see e.g. Bowler 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The steep altitudinal gradient of the study landscape (&gt;1000 m) allows trees to migrate upwards, tracking their suitable climate niche. Doing so, European beech increasingly occupies areas dominated by Norway spruce, while giving way to oak and hornbeam at lower elevations. From this setting emanates a specific climate change response in biodiversity, which does not necessarily mirror broad‐scale biodiversity trends, as species linked to overstorey tree species [e.g. saproxylic beetles associated with oak (Bergman
