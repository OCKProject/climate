<p class="p">In contrast to climate change, disturbance had a clear positive effect on the investigated forest biodiversity indicators, supporting our initial hypothesis. This result is in line with a wide range of literature on the impacts of disturbance on biodiversity in forest ecosystems (Thom &amp; Seidl 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, we found different biodiversity responses for changes in the frequency, severity and size of disturbance. While the effect of an increase in disturbance frequency and severity was consistently positive, an increase in disturbance size reduced the positive disturbance effect on biodiversity. High disturbance severity and increasing frequency facilitate edges, and create a complex pattern of open areas and remaining closed canopy forests, increasing the variation in ecological conditions and habitats (Perry

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). An increasing disturbance size, however, homogenizes areas and reduces the forest edge density (Hansson 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Future changes in climatic conditions are expected to further intensify disturbance regimes in many ecosystems (Seidl

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and will thus exert an important indirect impact of climate change on forest biodiversity. Our study suggests that increasing disturbance frequency and severity (at current disturbance sizes) can compensate negative effects of climate change on selected biodiversity indicators (e.g. tree diversity). This underlines that future studies should take a dynamic and integrative perspective on the potential trajectories of biodiversity beyond correlative relationships with temperature and precipitation. The value of such a perspective is furthermore underlined by finding century‐long lag times in biodiversity responses to climatic drivers (Menendez 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
