<p class="p">It is also important to note that the different definitions and focal indicators of biodiversity under consideration in different studies likely account for diverging reports on the climate change sensitivity of biodiversity. For ten out of eleven indicators, we here used species diversity as a proxy for biodiversity. Other important aspects of biodiversity not considered here include the abundance of rare species (e.g. red list species) or endemic species (Engler, Guisan &amp; Rechsteiner

Moreover, despite the fact that we studied eleven different biodiversity indicators spanning the plant and animal kingdoms, it would be desirable to also include, for instance, vertebrate species such as mammals, birds, amphibians or reptiles (see e.g. Maiorano
