<p class="p">Furthermore, addressing a wide range of species groups explicitly is important for conservation management to identify biota particularly at risk from climate change. Based on our analyses, these include Araneae, Carabidae and saproxylic beetles at the KA‐NP. As tree species diversity was also found to decrease, and many phytophages are host‐dependent (Brandle &amp; Brandl 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), a wide range of indicators might benefit from a coarse filter conservation approach aiming to maintain a diverse forest tree composition. Furthermore, migration corridors as well as temporal connectivity of hotspots on the landscape can help to maintain species threatened by climate change at the regional scale (Fischer, Lindenmayer &amp; Manning 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). These corridors should be designed particularly to connect current and future hotspots of biodiversity to allow species to relocate in response to changing climatic conditions.
