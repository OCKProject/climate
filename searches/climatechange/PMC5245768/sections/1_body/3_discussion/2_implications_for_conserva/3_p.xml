<p class="p">Our findings of positive disturbance impacts on biodiversity underline that intensifying disturbance regimes are congruent with the goals of biodiversity conservation in Central European forests. It is important to note, however, that this positive effect of disturbances can be strongly reduced or even offset by measures such as salvage logging and homogenizing disturbed areas (Lindenmayer &amp; Noss 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), which is current standard practice in the managed forest ecosystems of Central Europe. For example, the richness of saproxylic beetles as well as wood‐inhabiting fungi has been found to increase after disturbance events, but decreased severely when areas were salvage‐logged (Thorn
