<p class="p">Our study indicates that local hotspots of biodiversity can shift significantly under climate change, a fact that should be considered more explicitly in future conservation management. Spatio‐temporal analyses as the one presented here can support future conservation planning and foster prospective allocation of resources in conservation management. To increase the robustness of conservation decisions under changing environmental conditions, efforts should focus particularly on areas that are hotspots under both current and changed climatic conditions (see also Rose &amp; Burton

However, it also has to be noted that there are pronounced differences between different hotspot definitions (see Fig. S4), which underline remaining uncertainties in this regard. In the case of the KA‐NP, robust hotspots are located in the central and eastern reaches of the park at low to mid‐elevations in both variants investigated.
