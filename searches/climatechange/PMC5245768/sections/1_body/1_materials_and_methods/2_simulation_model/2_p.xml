<p class="p">For the current study, we evaluated the model's ability to simulate the KA‐NP by testing iLand's efficiency to reproduce expected values of productivity (Fig. S1, Supporting information), climate sensitivity (Fig. S2) and the potential natural vegetation (Fig. S3). Overall, these tests resulted in good correspondence of the model with independent observations and supported the application of iLand for studying ecosystem dynamics at the KA‐NP.</p>
