<p class="p">To simulate forest landscape dynamics at KA‐NP, we used iLand, the individual‐based forest landscape and disturbance model. iLand is a spatially explicit process‐based model. It was developed to simulate interactions between environmental drivers (e.g. climate regime, nutrient and water availability), forest vegetation processes (e.g. growth, mortality and regeneration) and disturbances regimes (e.g. windstorms, wildfires) (Seidl 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). Processes in iLand interact in a hierarchical multiscale framework, including processes on the tree (e.g. growth, mortality, competition for resources), stand (availability of water, nutrients) and landscape level (disturbance, seed dispersal). The simulation of primary production in iLand is based on a light‐use efficiency approach, with scalar modifiers accounting for the effects of temperature, soil water availability, vapour pressure deficit, nutrient availability as well as atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) concentration. Mortality of trees in iLand considers intrinsic mortality (i.e. age‐related causes) and stress‐related mortality (using carbon starvation as a physiological proxy for stress) as well as disturbance events such as windstorm or fire. Regeneration is spatially explicit and depends on the availability of seeds as well as favourable light and environmental conditions. A detailed description of iLand is available in Seidl
