<p class="p">To also address spatial changes in biodiversity on the landscape, we assessed biodiversity hotspots at KA‐NP; to that end, we identified areas that support a high diversity across all indicators. To be able to compare across indicators, we used percentiles of diversity estimates for all 360 simulations at the end of the simulation period. In analogy to the assessment of multifunctionality across ecosystem services (e.g. Pasari

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), hotspots were defined as area where every indicator reaches or exceeds a predefined threshold (here set this at the 25th percentile value). Differences between scenarios were analysed by means of McNemar's chi‐squared test, and spatial analysis of hotspots was conducted by mapping at a grain of 100‐m grid cells. To evaluate sensitivities of the result to this particular definition of hotspots, an alternative hotspot definition was also investigated (see Fig. S4 for details).
