<p class="p">We simulated the currently forested 13 865 ha of the KA‐NP for 1000 years with 36 unique combinations of climate and disturbance scenarios to derive tree species composition at the level of 100‐m grid cells. In addition to the four climate scenarios described above, we investigated all possible combinations of two different disturbance frequencies, severities and size scenarios for every climate scenario. The low‐intensity disturbance variant represents the current disturbance regime, with a rotation period of 250 years (Thom

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and a mean disturbance size of 5·3 ha (based on a disturbance inventory at KA‐NP). As moderate disturbance severity, we assumed a mortality of 50% of trees with diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) &gt; 10 cm in this variant. At increased disturbance scenarios, the disturbance rotation period was halved to 125 years, the size increased 10‐fold to 53·4 ha, and the severity doubled to 100%. Additionally, we included a scenario without disturbance, bringing the total number of studied disturbance scenarios to nine (2 frequencies × 2 severities × 2 sizes + 1 no disturbance scenario). Within these disturbance regime definitions, simulated disturbances were implemented stochastically in each scenario, with the actual disturbance size drawn from a negative exponential distribution, and the location of the disturbance assigned randomly to the landscape. Each scenario was replicated ten times to account for stochasticity in the simulation. We tested the sufficiency of using ten replicates per scenario by analysing the coefficients of variation (cv) of our response variables, and found robust results for all indicators at the end of the simulation period (cv &lt; 2% for all indicators and scenarios, Table S1). In total, 360 simulations were conducted (four climate scenarios × nine disturbance scenarios × 10 replicates). This simulation design was specifically developed (i) to stringently distinguish climate and disturbance effects on biodiversity (due to independence of climate and disturbance scenarios in the simulation) and (ii) to assess which disturbance regime parameters (i.e. size, severity or frequency) are most influential on biodiversity. To account for the vegetation changes that have occurred between 1999 (the year for which initial vegetation information was available) and 2013 (the initial year of the analysis), we ran the model for these 14 years using the respective climate forcing and recreating the disturbances that were observed during that period. Each simulation was then run over 1000 years starting in the year 2013.
