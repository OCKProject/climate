<p class="p">In a subsequent step, we used the fitted glms with the respective climate input and iLand‐derived tree layer information to project biodiversity responses for all scenarios. For each of the eleven indicators, we derived the effect of climate change at any given point in space and time by relating each simulation under climate change to the mean over the baseline period under the same disturbance scenario. For the analyses of climate change effects over time, we aggregated the 100‐m grid cells to landscape‐level mean responses. From these comparisons over all scenarios and replicates, the median and the 95th percentile range of climate‐induced diversity changes were computed. Similarly, the disturbance effect was calculated by relating scenarios of different disturbance frequency, severity and size to the respective undisturbed scenario under any given climate regime. Both climate and disturbance effects were tested against the null hypothesis of no effect by means of Wilcoxon's signed rank sum test.</p>
