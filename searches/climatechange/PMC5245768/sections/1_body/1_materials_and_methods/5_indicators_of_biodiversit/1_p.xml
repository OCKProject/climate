<p class="p">To obtain a comprehensive assessment of the climate and disturbance effects on forest biodiversity, we jointly analysed eleven different biodiversity indicators for each simulated 1‐ha grid cell. Tree species diversity and canopy complexity were directly derived from iLand simulations. Basal area shares were used to compute tree species diversity, using the exponent of the Shannon index [exp(
 <italic class="italic">H'</italic>)] as an indicator for the effective number of tree species. Canopy complexity was described by means of the rumple index (Parker 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), which is the ratio of the canopy surface area to the projected ground surface area, calculated here at 10‐m horizontal resolution. With regard to animal diversity, richness data (the number of species) on Araneae (web spiders), Carabidae (ground beetles), Hemiptera (true bugs), Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, bees and ants), Mollusca (snails and slugs), saproxylic (deadwood‐dependent) beetles, Symphyta (sawflies), as well as Syrphidae (hoverflies), were derived from biodiversity inventories (0·1‐ha plots) in 52 locations distributed over neighbouring Bavaria (Bässler 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Furthermore, data on the richness of the ground vegetation (vascular plant species with a height of up to 60 cm) were derived from the FlorAlp data base (Dullinger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) by selecting releves with a uniform size of 625 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 852). Based on these data, we developed empirical response functions for the nine biodiversity indicators not derived directly from simulations, where the response variable (the number of species in each group) was related to mean annual precipitation sum (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub>) and mean annual temperature (Tmean) (indicators of the climate regime), canopy cover (an indicator for light availability and the local thermal regime) and the relative share of canopy tree species (indicators of species association). We used negative binomial generalized linear models (glms) with a logarithmic link function to predict species diversity of each indicator. Based on ecological theory, we hypothesized an optimum relationship of temperature and canopy cover for each indicator and consequently transformed these predictors using second‐order polynomial functions (Austin 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The transformed variable was retained if the species diversity response was biologically meaningful. To determine the model most strongly supported by the data, we used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), Nagelkerke 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>² values as well as 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐values from chi‐square goodness‐of‐fit tests. Final models were tested for multicollinearity by means of (generalized) variance inflation factors (VIF or GVIF). To further analyse the thus‐derived empirical models with regard to their response to climate and tree vegetation changes, a local sensitivity analysis was conducted.
