<p class="p">The Kalkalpen National Park (KA‐NP) is located at N47.47° E14.22°, in the northern front range of the Austrian Alps (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The landscape is characterized by steep mountainous terrain, with elevations ranging from 385 to 1963 m a.s.l. Soils are predominately shallow with Lithic and Rendzic Leptosols and Chromic Cambisols as the dominant soil types over calcareous bedrock. The climate varies with topography, with temperature decreasing (mean annual temperature range: 3·6–9·0 °C) and precipitation increasing (mean annual precipitation range 1205–1741 mm) with elevation. With a total size of 20 856 ha mainly consisting of forests, the Kalkalpen National Park is the largest forest wilderness in Austria. It includes a diverse range of forest ecosystems including European beech

 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> (L. Karst.) and silver fir 
 <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> (Mill.) in mid‐elevations and subalpine spruce forests in high elevations. Before establishment of the KA‐NP in 1997, the area was managed mainly for timber production, but today conforms to IUCN category II (National Park).
