<p class="p">Soil and climate varied at a spatial grain of 100 × 100 m in the simulations (in total 19 200 ha), while the initial vegetation conditions were derived for stand polygons covering the 13 865 ha forest area of the KA‐NP (median stand size: 1·4 ha). Soil depth and type (Kobler

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) were used to characterize soil conditions. To initialize the current vegetation, we combined data sources from forest inventory and planning data, aerial photo analysis and LiDAR. Altogether, we initialized more than 2 10

Four climate scenarios were studied: a baseline climate scenario where we repeatedly sampled years from the period 1950–2010 for the 1000‐year simulation period, and three regionally downscaled climate change scenarios, representing different combinations of global and regional circulation models under A1B forcing. A stabilization of climate conditions at the level of 2080–2099 was assumed for the years beyond 2100 (i.e.
