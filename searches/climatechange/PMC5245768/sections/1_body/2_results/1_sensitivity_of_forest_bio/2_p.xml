<p class="p">Analyses of the fitted parameters and sensitivity analysis indicated that taxonomic groups reacted non‐uniformly to modifications in their environment (Table S2). Changes in average temperature, for instance, resulted in a range of responses: while species groups such as Hymenoptera and Syrphidae strongly benefited from increasing temperatures (+71·8% and +49·9% for a + 1 °C increase), others such as Araneae and saproxylic beetles were clearly negatively affected (−9·3% and −8·8% for the same temperature increase). Compared to this distinct temperature effect, precipitation had a weaker influence on diversity in species groups. Six out of nine models maintained precipitation as covariate though, with Araneae, Carabidae, Hymenoptera and saproxylic beetles showing negative responses, while ground vegetation and Syrphidae responding positively to an increase in precipitation. Besides the impacts of changing climatic conditions, changes in tree vegetation were also important determinants of diversity in species groups. While the proportion of beech and spruce was found to have negative impacts on biodiversity, the share of oak

 <italic class="italic">Quercus robur</italic> (L.) and hornbeam 
 <italic class="italic">Carpinus betulus</italic> (L.) positively influenced diversity in a range of species groups. An increase in canopy cover was found to have negative effects on the species diversity of most taxonomic groups (between −1·8% and −13·6% for a 10% increase in canopy cover) – only Carabidae and saproxylic beetles were weakly positively related to canopy cover.
