<p class="p">After 1000 years of simulation, areas identified as hotspots were substantially different when comparing baseline climate and climate change conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). While hotspots in the baseline climate scenario were mainly located at low to moderate elevation, climate change supported hotspots in higher‐elevation zones. The extent of hotspot area strongly decreased under changed climatic conditions (

 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a), but only a heavily fragmented 0·1% remained under changed climatic conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c). Disturbance significantly increased the extent of hotspot areas (
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0·001), for example by 146·1% under baseline climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Under future climate, the simulations resulted in a total hotspot area of at least 18·4% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d), of which 23·1% overlapped with current hotspots.
