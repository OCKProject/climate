<p class="p">Our simulations indicated a pronounced increase in the share of European beech and a decrease in Norway spruce under climate change (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with changes progressing considerably beyond the assumed point of climate stabilization in 2100. Tree species composition did, however, also change under baseline climate conditions, highlighting past management legacies in the current tree species composition. The combined effects of direct and indirect responses to climate change on the eleven biodiversity indicators were strongly divergent. While six indicators showed overall positive responses, five were negatively affected at the end of the 1000‐year simulation period (

Climate change was beneficial for the diversity of ground vegetation, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mollusca, Symphyta and Syrphidae, but reduced the diversity of Araneae, Carabidae and saproxylic beetles as well as the canopy complexity of forests in the landscape (Fig.

 <xref rid="jpe12644-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Tree species diversity was slightly positively affected during the first 100–200 years, but eventually dropped to −35·8% compared to baseline climate conditions. The most drastic changes in a wide range of species groups were found during the first 100 years of the simulation, indicating a prominent direct climate effect. Tree layer‐mediated indirect effects were most distinctive for Araneae and saproxylic beetles, where the increase in oak and hornbeam cover in response to warming (positive indirect effect) compensated direct negative impacts of elevated temperature and reduced precipitation over the long term. The opposite signal was found for Hemiptera and Symphyta: while direct climate change effects were beneficial for both species groups, the climate‐induced increase in beech negatively influenced species diversity in these groups.
