<p class="p">While climate change impacts on diversity were ambiguous, but strong for each indicator studied, the effect of disturbance was generally positive, but less pronounced (Table

Increases in both disturbance frequency and severity were positively associated with all biodiversity indicators (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The opposite was the case for disturbance size, where an increase in the mean disturbance size was found to decrease biodiversity.
