<p class="p">Future climate change impacts on plant and animal diversity have predominantly been assessed using niche models, that is empirical relationships between species presence or abundance and climate variables (Zimmermann

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Notwithstanding their scientific value (e.g. assessing the climatic suitability of species and their potential range for migration under future climate), such models have major shortcomings in the context of conservation planning and management. For instance, they commonly ignore biotic interactions that strongly affect species composition [but see Thuiller 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>)]. Moreover, niche models assume that species track changing climatic conditions instantaneously, disregarding time‐lags and indirect effects of climate change such as habitat changes and disturbance‐driven perturbations (Elith &amp; Leathwick 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In contrast, process‐based forest simulation models project transient pathways of ecosystem change while accounting for the complex and interacting effects of climate change (Kearney &amp; Porter 
 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). These approaches, however, usually focus solely on tree vegetation and rarely address other species relevant in the context of biodiversity conservation.
