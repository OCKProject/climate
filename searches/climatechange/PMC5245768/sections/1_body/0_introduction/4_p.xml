<p class="p">Here, we combined landscape‐scale forest simulation modelling with empirical climate–diversity relationships to circumvent many of these limitations. Our aim was to address the climate sensitivity of forest biodiversity explicitly in space and time, and particularly study the effect of current and changed climate and disturbance regimes over an extended time frame of 1000 years. Our specific objectives were to (i) investigate the role of climate change on a wide range of indicators of forest biodiversity over time, (ii) assess the effects of different disturbance frequencies, severities and sizes on biodiversity indicators and (iii) identify current and future biodiversity hotspots at the landscape scale to facilitate future conservation management. The latter question is of particular relevance as identifying and preserving areas of particular value for biodiversity, for example due to their particular richness or habitat value for keystone species (Myers

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), is a cornerstone of current conservation management. Many existing protected areas are centred on such biodiversity hotspots, yet whether these systems also will remain hotspots in a drastically changing climate remains uncertain (see e.g. Hansen

Here, we tested for a shift of biodiversity hotspots along the steep altitudinal gradients of our study landscape to higher‐elevation areas due to reduced thermal limitations in a future climate. Based on previous large‐scale assessments, we furthermore hypothesized an overall negative impact of climate change on forest biodiversity (Thomas

 <xref rid="jpe12644-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, we tested the hypothesis that a slow response of forest composition and structure leads to a considerable time‐lag in the response of biodiversity to changing climatic conditions (Bertrand
