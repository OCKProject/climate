 </sup>, were similar to that evaluated using Landsat imagery (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), though, higher resolution imagery and newly developed maps enabled the evaluation of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in greenness, highlighting the strong interaction between landforms and climate influencing greenness trends (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We found trends in greenness were specific to geomorphic type and sensitive to either temperature or precipitation change (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with the exception of tundra ponds, which was found to be sensitive to both climatic drivers. The climatic sensitivity of tundra ponds is in line with hypothesized drivers of vegetation change

 </sup>. Although, relationships between decreasing NDVI and increasing temperature were identified for high-center polygons, low-center polygons, and riparian corridors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), it is important to note that significant greening occurred across all geomorphic types until temperatures warmed beyond +1.06 °C, where NDVI decreases sharply (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). However, the greening trend may begin to increase if warming is greater than ~+1.70 °C. Generally, at the landscape scale, we find greening to increase if precipitation decreases more than -10 mm relative to normal precipitation patterns, whereas browning increased with precipitation. This pattern was likely identified in response to either wetting/drying of water saturated tundra soils and/or increased cloudiness (associated with increased precipitation) that may decrease productivity in response to a reduction in photosynthetically active radiation

 </sup>. However, although NDVI generally decreased with increased precipitation, this pattern was not able to explain the regionally specific variability in NDVI that occurred among landforms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
