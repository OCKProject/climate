<p id="Par19" class="p">As the climate continues to warm, we can expect an increased occurrence of browning across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), but the rate at which the landscape browns, depends on the magnitude of temperature and precipitation change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), with the exception of young geomorphic types from recently drained lakes (e.g. nonpatterned drained thaw lake basins and low-center polygons) that will likely continue to green. These patterns were highlighted in our analysis as historical NDVI trends varied by tundra geomorphic type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Browning was particularly sensitive to elevated temperature and/or precipitation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), both of which are predicted to increase across arctic tundra regions
