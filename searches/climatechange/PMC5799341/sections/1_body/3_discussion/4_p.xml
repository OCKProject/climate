<p id="Par22" class="p">Although this work increases our understanding of past and future greenness patterns in arctic coastal tundra ecosystems, it is unclear if differences in greening versus browning trends for each geomorphic type (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) were associated with local disturbances. For example, the prevalence of thermokarst pits (upland tundra: drained slopes and high-center polygons) and associated increases in surface wetness

The interpretation of greening and browning signals spanning small to large spatiotemporal scales (i.e plot to pan-Arctic) is difficult, as multiple climatic and environmental factors influence NDVI trends, which are likely related but spatially dependent. For example, at the Pan-Arctic scale, greening has been linked to extra-Arctic processes such as CO

 </sup> can also notably impact vegetation productivity and NDVI. A holistic ecosystem perspective is required to unravel the spatiotemporal complexity involved with changing tundra greenness, which we are beginning to understand, but are limited by few observational data and comprehensive analyses across scales and platforms of observation.
