<p id="Par23" class="p">Our findings indicate tundra geomorphic heterogeneity and regional climate change are dominant factors controlling decadal scale trends in greenness. Thus, a detailed understanding of how climate interacts with landforms is necessary for evaluating the spatiotemporal ecosystem interactions that impact regional-global patterns of plant productivity. Although, correlations between NDVI and vegetation productivity are robust across latitudinal gradients

 </sup> arctic coastal tundra ecosystem. Ecosystem and earth system models generally predict plant productivity to increase associated with projected climate change across northern latitudes. However, assuming our observed greenness trends correspond with productivity trends, we predict a reduction in carbon uptake potential across much of the ACP of northern Alaska in response to projected warmer and/or wetter climatic conditions. In combination, with deeper active layer depths

It is important to better understand how regional-global trends in greening and browning correspond to both local and regional phenomena to enhance our predictive capacity and ability to detect change in plant productivity across the Pan-Arctic to constrain our predictive uncertainty related to the future state and fate of global climate change
