 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), all coastal saline water, lakes, rivers, and urban pixels were removed. Primarily due to limited data acquisition across the ACP prior to 1999, we restrict decadal greenness trends (i.e. absolute change and percent change relative to 1999) to 1999–2014 throughout this paper.
