<p id="Par13" class="p">The TreeNet Gradient Boosting machine, developed within the Salford Predictive Modeler
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> v.8.0 (Salford Systems), was used to run all BRT analyses. A “shaving” procedure was used to iteratively remove and rerun the BRT analysis to minimize the mean squared error, where 80% (n = 276) of the dataset was used for model development (i.e. learning) and 20% (n = 53) was used for independent model evaluation (i.e. testing). BRT learning rate, tree complexity, and loss criterion, was set to 0.1, 6, and Huber-M, respectively. To ensure reproducibility, we used a seed state of 987654321 for model initialization. Partial dependency plots were used to show the response of individual predictor variables to the BRT analysis, using fitted functions
