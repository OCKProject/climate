 </sup>, where each watershed was divided into two subunits (i.e. lowland/upland) associated with the second elevation quantile. Prior to spatial analysis, we identified outlier pixels by determining if NDVI change was &gt;75.0% or &lt; −75.0% per decade, and used a nearest neighbor filtering algorithm for the recalculation of pixels within a 5 × 5 pixel window, which represented &lt;0.1% of all pixels on the ACP (residual unfiltered open water pixels).
