<p id="Par7" class="p">A series of proceeding functions were developed using individual and combined spectral bands, geometric object shapes/sizes (i.e. perimeter, area, roundness), and proximity functions to further differentiate respective geomorphology classes

 </sup>. Using this approach we mapped fifteen geomorphological and hydrologically distinct geomorphic types (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) at 30 × 30 m spatial resolution, including (qualitatively ranked from wet to dry), 1) coastal saline water, which commonly encroach into terrestrial lakes due to processes related to coastal erosion or lagoon formation, 2) lakes (large: &gt;90 ha, medium: ≤90 and &gt;20 ha, small: ≤20 ha), 3) rivers, 4) ponds, 5) coalescent low-center polygons, 6) nonpatterned drained thaw lake basins, 7) low-center polygons, 8) flat-center polygons,9) riparian corridors 10) high-center polygons, 11) sandy barrens, 12) drained slopes, 13) sand dunes, 14) ice/snow, and 15) urban. Refer to Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> for surface characteristics related to moisture, relief, and vegetation communities specific to geomorphic type. For this analysis, all lake sizes were grouped into one “Lake” category.
