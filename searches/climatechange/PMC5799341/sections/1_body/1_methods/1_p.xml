<p id="Par5" class="p">We studied the effects of climate and tundra geomorphic types on decadal scale trends in greening across the ACP, which stretches from the western coast along the Chukchi sea to the Beaufort coastal plains at the Alaskan/Canadian border (latitude: 68–71°N; longitude: 140–167°W). This region is representative of ~1.9 million km

Annual precipitation is variable but typically ranges from 120–200 mm. We defined the ACP spatial domain by the geographic land area within the Northern/Southern Chukchi Sea Coast, Beaufort Sea Coast, Beaufort Coastal Plain, and a section of the Brooks Range Foothills on the Krusenstern Coastal Plain, all of which are composed of a high density of polygonal tundra or patterned ground (Fig.
