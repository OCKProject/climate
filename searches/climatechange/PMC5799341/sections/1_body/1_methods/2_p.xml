Multiresolution segmentation and spectral difference algorithms were used to separate pixels into “image objects”, which were divided into open water, aquatic, wet, moist, dry classes using reference data (i.e. field/ground truth points and high resolution aerial/satellite imagery) and class thresholds based on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).
