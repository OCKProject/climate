 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>) were all transformed to fit the assumptions of normality, and only important factors identified by the preceding BRT analysis were input into the stepwise procedure, used to predict regional greenness trends by fitting potentially important climate and/or environmental variables. A five-fold cross validation was concurrently performed, which divided the dataset into 5 subsets or 80:20 and iteratively used each 80% subset to predict the other 20% (e.g. k-1). The average R

These included the Community Earth System Model 4 (NCAR-CCSM4), Coupled Model 3.0 (GFDL-CM3), ModelE/Russell (GISS-E2-R), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model v5A (IPSL-CM5A), and the Coupled General Circulation Model v3.0 (MRI-CGCM3). Selected model runs included the AR5 representative concentration pathways RCPs 8.5 (high) and 4.5 (low). We assumed no change in tundra geomorphic type distribution for model simulations.
