  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Concurrently, the climate of the ACP has changed and appears to be regionally specific, with some regions warming more extensively than others and increasing/decreasing in precipitation. Additionally, across the ACP, the spatial distribution of fine-scale tundra landforms (here after referred to as “geomorphic types”), varies significantly

 </sup>. Here we focus on evaluating key factors controlling decadal scale surface NDVI (i.e. greening versus browning), and evaluate what regions and geomorphic types are most sensitive to future climate change. We calculated decadal NDVI trends using Landsat imagery from sensors, Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the Observing Land Imager (OLI), and assessed the variability in greenness from local to regional scales by using novel mapping techniques
