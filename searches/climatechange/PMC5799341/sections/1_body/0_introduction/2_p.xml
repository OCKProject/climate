<p id="Par3" class="p">To date, our knowledge of circumpolar patterns of greening are derived from coarse-resolution sensors on board satellites, such as the global 8 km and 1 km resolution Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and to a lesser extent the 1 to 0.25 km resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)

 </sup>, these studies typically feature a similar physiography and/or climate, limiting the evaluation of how similar vegetation types and/or landforms may respond to different climate regimes. It is difficult to assess such patterns across Arctic regions for a variety of reasons, but perhaps most importantly because of the limited availability of high quality land cover datasets, which do not exist, are only regionally specific, or do not adequately represent heterogeneity across the tundra landscape to decipher meaningful patterns
