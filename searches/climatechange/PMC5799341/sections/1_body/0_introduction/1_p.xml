<p id="Par2" class="p">Over the past few decades, greening or increased vegetation productivity in Arctic tundra lowlands has been inferred from trends in satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

 </sup>. It is important to recognize that arctic tundra landscapes are highly heterogeneous and have historically been in a slow but continuous state of change associated with permafrost thaw and aggradation processes related to periglacial landscape dynamics
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, patches of browning or negative NDVI trends have also been commonly observed across arctic tundra regions, but until recently the greening signal prevailed
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Since 2011, regional shifts toward surface browning have reversed the direction of the trend after nearly 33 years of arctic greening
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. If such change in greening indeed corresponds with a reduction in vegetation productivity or carbon uptake capacity via photosynthesis, then nearly all ecosystem and earth system models have not foreseen this shift. Therefore, it is urgent to understand what may be controlling this spatiotemporal shift in browning across the Arctic and if this change is anomalous or represents a new long-term trajectory towards reduced vegetation productivity and carbon uptake in the Arctic tundra
