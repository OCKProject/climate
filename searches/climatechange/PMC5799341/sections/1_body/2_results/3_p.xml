<p id="Par17" class="p">Regionally, the cross-validated multivariate regression model identified climate anomalies of precipitation and temperature, wet%, and elevation to be the most important predictors of historical NDVI trends (R² = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001; five-fold cross validation R² = 0.30), which suggests that increasing the decadal precipitation and temperature anomalies will decrease NDVI trends (i.e. browning), whereas an increase in wet% (i.e. nonpatterned drained thaw lake basins and low-center polygons) area will increase NDVI trends, both consistent with the BRT analysis. Furthermore, NDVI correlations with temperature and precipitation anomalies specific to geomorphic type, provide insight into regional scale controls on decadal NDVI change, as nearly all geomorphic types were sensitive to either temperature or precipitation anomalies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Significant decreases in NDVI with warmer temperatures were found for high-center polygons, low-center polygons, sandy barrens, nonpatterned drained thaw lake basins, and riparian corridors, whereas pond NDVI increased with warming. Decreases in NDVI were also identified for sand dunes, drained slopes, and ponds associated with increased precipitation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The geomorphic type most sensitive to temperature-mediated NDVI change, inferred from the highest decadal rate of change, were ponds (R² = 0.28, p = 0.002, n = 30) and riparian corridors (R² = 0.30, p = 0.001, n = 31), which increased and decreased NDVI with warming, respectively. In contrast, the geomorphic types most sensitive to precipitation-mediated reduction in the NDVI trend, were ponds (R² = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001, n = 30), followed closely by drained slopes (R² = 0.22, p = 0.008, n = 31). We did not identify any significant relationships linking increased greening with increased precipitation among geomorphic types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), consistent with BRT analysis and regression model. We associated climate sensitivities to patterns of greenness in sandy barrens and sand dunes to spectral differences associated with saturated versus unsaturated soils in response to warmer/wetter conditions and not explicitly a vegetation response in these sparsely vegetated types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Cumulatively, the relative importance of regional climate change for predicting the trajectory of greening versus browning was made strikingly apparent as ~61% or 35,800 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the ACP were sensitive to change in temperature, whereas only ~10% or 5,900 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> were sensitive to change in precipitation.
