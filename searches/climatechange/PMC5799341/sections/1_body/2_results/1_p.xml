<p id="Par15" class="p">We found the regional distribution of tundra geomorphic types and greenness to vary markedly across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The newly developed tundra geomorphology map represented the spatial distribution of polygonal tundra well with an overall map accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient of 76% and 0.73, respectively (Supplemental Table

 </sup>. Map statistics indicated that high-center polygons, low-center polygons, and lakes were the predominant features across the ~60,000 km² ACP representing 69.3% of the total land cover area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Watersheds ranged from 15 to 13,406 km² with a median of 2,128 km², which also varied in geomorphic type distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Historical NDVI trends varied between regional watersheds (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), and across geomorphic types (Supplemental Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>), suggesting that indeed trends in greening and browning are locally and regionally specific. Generally, across the ACP historical trends in NDVI (±standard deviation) differed by geomorphic type as observed in ponds (0.005 ± 0.22), coalescent low-center (0.035 ± 0.11), nonpatterned drained thaw lake basins (0.032 ± 0.14), low-center (0.044 ± 0.06), flat-center (0.046 ± 0.05), riparian corridor (0.039 ± 0.13), high-center (0.041 ± 0.05), and drained slope (0.042 ± 0.04).
