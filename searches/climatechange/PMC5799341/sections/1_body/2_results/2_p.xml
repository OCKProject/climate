<p id="Par16" class="p">The gradient boosting analysis used 183 regression trees to construct a robust model that well represented the variability in historical greenness trends (learning/testing, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.72, 0.62). After “shaving” or recursive predictor elimination procedures were complete, the final BRT analysis determined geomorphic type (100.0), temperature change (64.5), precipitation change (61.5), elevation (49.1), and precipitation normal (50.3) to be the most important factors (i.e. “variable importance”, expressed as a percentage, scaled to the most important factor) controlling greenness trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Partial dependency plots illustrate the strong control of geomorphic type on NDVI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>), as generally, the higher the soil moisture the lower the rate of decadal greening. This is in line with partial dependency plots for precipitation and temperature change, which indicate that NDVI increased (i.e. greening) with reduced precipitation and cooler temperatures, whereas the NDVI decreased (i.e. browning) with increased precipitation and warmer temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Specifically, precipitation change greater than +31 mm was associated with substantial decreases in NDVI, while precipitation change associated with drier conditions, less than -10 mm increased NDVI. Interestingly, partial dependency plots for temperature change reveal that a potential NDVI threshold exists, inferring that if warming is limited to below +1.06 °C, the tundra continues to experience increased NDVI, but if warming exceeds that threshold NDVI is substantially reduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). However, greening may slowly resume after +1.70 °C of warming. Although elevation and precipitation normal did not account for most of the BRT model variability, they nevertheless notably impacted tundra geomorphology greenness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Because temperature and precipitation change predictors did not meet the assumption of normality, we used log transformed temperature and precipitation anomalies in the ensuing multivariate analysis.
