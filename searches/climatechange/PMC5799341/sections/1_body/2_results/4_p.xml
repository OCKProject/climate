<p id="Par18" class="p">To evaluate how NDVI trends may change over the next decade (i.e. 2020–2029), derived multivariate models were applied across the ACP using five IPCC climate models and two emission scenarios (i.e. RCP 8.5 and 4.5). Generally, we find the projected change in NDVI will likely vary in magnitude and spatial distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) associated with future climate change (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Simulations suggest the greatest magnitude of change in greening and browning relative to long term trends (1984–2014) were for the MRI-CGCM3 RCP 8.5 and GFDL-CM3 RCP 8.5 climates, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, although, predicted change in NDVI notably varied between climate models, emission scenarios add another degree of uncertainty, as highlighted by the trajectory shift from greening to browning found with NCAR-CCSM4 and IPSL-CM5A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Moreover, predicted change in NDVI may be expected to vary spatially (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), as all models indicate the western Chukchi coast will experience the greatest browning (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and the northeastern Beaufort coastal plain will experience the most greening. However, regions anticipated to have the highest greening trends by 2020–2029, also have the highest uncertainty or disagreement among model outputs (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
