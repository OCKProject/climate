 <italic class="italic">Cyananthus</italic> species that had at least 100 specimen records distributed in the HHM: five species from each genus satisfied this criterion; their elevations ranged from ∼2800 m to 4000 m. The original dataset contained 2,866 specimen records, ranging from 123 specimens (
 <italic class="italic">Cyananthus lobatus</italic>) to 614 specimens (
 <italic class="italic">Primula sonchifolia</italic>). The following specimens were removed from the dataset: duplicate records with the same collector and collection number; specimens with elevation or collection records located far beyond the species distribution ranges based on the 
 <italic class="italic">Flora of China</italic>; specimens with obvious identification errors; specimens that lacked spatial coordinates for georeferencing in Google Earth; and, to reduce the effect of spatial autocorrelation and the consequent overfitting, records within five kilometers of each other (
