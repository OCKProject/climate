We chose the Global Circulation Model (GCM) ACCESS1-0, which has been shown to perform the best in the HHM region (

We used two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories for future climate conditions: an optimistic scenario whereby emissions peak around 2040 and then decline (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 4.5), and a pessimistic scenario whereby emissions continue to rise throughout the century (RCP 8.5).
