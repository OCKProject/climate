<p id="p0075" class="p">All the species in our study are projected to expand their ranges under the more optimistic RCP 4.5 scenario but some of the species are projected to show greater range expansion under the more pessimistic RCP 8.5 scenario. These projections are in stark contrast to those of previous studies that have projected decreases in species ranges due to climate change. For example, the distribution of beech trees is expected to decrease by 2100 due to increased climate variability (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saltre et al., 2015</xref>), and by 2070 a decline in suitable climate space is projected for the two threatened dipterocarp trees (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deb et al., 2017</xref>) and the Tertiary relict tree species 
 <italic class="italic">Davidia involucrate</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Under the global warming scenarios projected in our study, however, suitable habitats may not be limited for most of the alpine species, which appear to be able to expand their distribution under our model projections. Similarly, a high proportion of plant species (63.6%) in the HHM have shown range expansion under future climate warming scenarios, but only a small proportion of plant species (11.9%) have been projected to experience range contraction (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). According to our model, the range of two species (
 <italic class="italic">C. inflatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. tangutica</italic>), which expand in the RCP 4.5 scenario, are projected to contract under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Under this same scenario, the ranges of another two species (
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocalyx</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. sonchifolia</italic>) are expected to expand less. Unsurprisingly, the species (
 <italic class="italic">P. tangutica</italic>) that occupies the highest latitude in our study is projected to encounter the greatest limitations to range expansion, likely due to the lack of suitable habitat in the north. While other three species (
 <italic class="italic">C. inflatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. macrocalyx</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. sonchifolia</italic>) that occupy relatively low latitudes and low elevations are projected to lose the largest areas in the southern margin of their distribution. Collectively, our projections indicate that although there is suitable habitat for future range expansion, if more extreme climatic changes persist, some of the alpine species in our study may decrease in range size, possibly resulting in local extinction.
