<p id="p0080" class="p">We also found that the expansion area was in most cases larger than the contraction area, indicating that most of the species in our study will actually increase their area of occupied sites in response to climate change. Other models have projected that in response to a warming climate the land surface area suitable for plant occupation in some mountain habitats would increase rather than decrease (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liang et al. (2018)</xref> concluded that, in the Hengduan Mountains, species would expand their ranges because the complex topography in high elevation areas provide sufficient land surfaces, which would promote not only upward shifts in elevation, but also expansion into the adjacent Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which can accommodate northward shifting species and mitigate range contractions. Similarly, most 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species in the HHM are expected to expand their range sizes through upward shifts in elevation, as climate warming is expected to reduce permafrost and increase potential habitats for upshifting species (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">You et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, northwestern Yunnan, western Sichuan, and southeastern Tibet appear to be stable areas with suitable habitats that can accommodate alpine herbaceous species in response to climate change. These regions may be particularly useful for future
