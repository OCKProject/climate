<p id="p0070" class="p">Our models predict that the distribution of all 
 <italic class="italic">Cyanathus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Primula</italic> species in our study will show a consistent response to a warming climate; specifically, the distributions of these species will shift upward in elevation and northward in latitude so that species will occupy living conditions similar to that of their previous habitats. Our predictions are consistent with previous studies that modeled distributional changes in response to climate change for other species in the region. For example, northward and upward shifts in distribution have been detected in wild soybean (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Poudel et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the westward shifts in distribution projected by our models are not surprising. Because high mountain habitats converge in the western portion of the HHM, when species distributions shift upwards in elevation, they will likely shift westward in longitude. This same trend has been projected for other alpine species in the HHM (
