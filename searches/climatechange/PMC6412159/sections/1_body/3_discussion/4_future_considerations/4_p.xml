<p id="p0095" class="p">The species selected in our study are mainly those with an abundant number of herbarium specimens in order to have enough valid data for modeling projections. As such, the species included in our study are those with a relatively wide distribution and abundance. Species with a more localized distribution and less abundance are largely ignored in this analysis due to the limited number of herbarium specimens available for data collection. Such species, however, may be the most susceptible to climate change due to their narrow niche occupation and habitat requirements. This limitation highlights the need for future studies to include field-based investigations on the distribution of locally endemic species and their fate under future climate change scenarios.</p>
