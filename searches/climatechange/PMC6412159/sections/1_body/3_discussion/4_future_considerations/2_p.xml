<p id="p0085" class="p">In this study, we assumed that potential habitats could be fully occupied by species with full dispersal capability when only considered the impacts of climate change. Our projections, however, did not consider several biotic factors that may impact our results, such as limited dispersal capability, pollination syndrome, and competition among species. For example, a loss of distribution area of up to 61.10% (full dispersal assumption) and 68.91% (no dispersal) was observed in SDM projections of crop wild relatives (

Although these sources of variation may affect the outcomes of our projections on a local scale, we anticipate that the general trends shown here may not change as climate is likely a dominant factor leading species distributional changes at a broader regional scale (
