<p id="p0090" class="p">The model projections in this study span ten species across two genera and reveal almost the same distributional changes across all species. The consistency of these projections provides confidence in the validity of our models. However, although our modeling process was previously shown to perform well in the HHM region, our projections rely on this single GCM. To expand the confidence in model projections, future studies should include more GCMs to evaluate the magnitude of variation that may be associated with different climate models.</p>
