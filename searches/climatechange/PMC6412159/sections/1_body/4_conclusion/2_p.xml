<p id="p0100" class="p">Our study highlights the usefulness of herbarium specimen data for evaluating species distribution and predicting species distributional changes under the effects of climate change. The results are consistent with previous studies that show species will shift upward in elevation, northward in latitude and westward in longitude under a warming climate scenario, however, our species are also projected to expand their ranges as the loss of previously occupied habitat is less than that of newly acquired areas. Great opportunities for the exploration of species distributional dynamics under climate change remain to be explored, including using digitalized herbarium specimens, citizen scientists, and targeted field surveys. These new approaches to examining responses to climate change may provide insights for targeted species protection. The utilization of more comprehensive models that consider both the biotic and abiotic factors contributing to species persistence will provide valuable data for making conservation decisions under future climate scenarios.</p>
