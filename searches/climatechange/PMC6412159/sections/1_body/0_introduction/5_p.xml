<p id="p0025" class="p">In this study, we explore how the distribution of selected 
 <italic class="italic">Cyanathus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Primula</italic> alpine species endemic to the HHM may respond to climate change. Specifically, we extract species distribution information from herbarium specimens collected in the last century and, combined with climate data from WorldClim, we use species distribution models (SDM) to project species distributional dynamics under future climate warming conditions.
