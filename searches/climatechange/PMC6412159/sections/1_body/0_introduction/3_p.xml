 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lenoir et al., 2008</xref>). Due to their relatively low biotic complexity, climate change is suspected to be a dominant factor affecting range shifts in alpine species, which are often accompanied with marginal extinction at the warm edge and expansion at the cold edge (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pauli et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, because species distributed at high elevations are usually endemic to specific regions and have relatively narrow climate tolerances, they often experience a “nowhere-to-go” scenario, i.e., cold habitats are limited to the summits of mountainous regions (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fois et al., 2016</xref>). Five comprehensive model projections have also shown that approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the species distributed at higher elevations will lose more than 80% of their suitable habitats by 2070–2100, and cold-adapted mountain flora are at the highest risk for local extinction (
