<p id="p0020" class="p">The Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) region stretches over two global biodiversity hotspots, the Mountains of Southwest China and the Himalayas, both of which harbor a diversity of habitats and a high level of plant biodiversity (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mittermeier, 2004</xref>). A large proportion of alpine and sub-nival plant species are endemic to the region (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) and the area has experienced extensive glacial retreat and tree line advancement in the last century (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baker and Moseley, 2007</xref>). Two alpine genera in particular, 
 <italic class="italic">Cyananthus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Primula,</italic> are suspected to be at risk of extinction due to climate change in the HHM (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Cyananthus</italic> (Campanulaceae) comprises approximately 26 species with the highest level of diversity in the HHM (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Primula</italic> (Primulaceae) contains about 500 species, among which 200 species are mainly distributed in this region (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Most of the species in these two genera are perennial herbs, and although climate change is suspected to be a significant threat to remaining populations, there are few empirical studies that have investigated how these species may respond to climate change.
