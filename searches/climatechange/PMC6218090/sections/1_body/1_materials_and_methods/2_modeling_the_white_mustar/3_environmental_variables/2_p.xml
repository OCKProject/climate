<p class="p">The environmental layers were masked to span the Mediterranean Basin using ArcMap ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). To avoid overparameterization, the climatic variables and PET were reduced by a varimax-rotated principal components analysis (PCA). The PCA identified four factors with eigenvalues exceeding one, explaining 86.14% of the total variance. The first factor was influenced mainly by annual mean temperature (Bio1) (loading factor = 0.95). The second axis was influenced by the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5) (-0.96). The third axis was influenced by annual precipitation (Bio12) (-0.98). The last axis was influenced by isothermality (Bio3) (0.97). Based on the high factor loading for the main variable explaining each PC, these four climatic variables were retained for the SDM.</p>
