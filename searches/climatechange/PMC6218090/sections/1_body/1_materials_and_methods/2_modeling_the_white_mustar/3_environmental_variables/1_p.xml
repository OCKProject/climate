The slope was derived from the altitude layer using QGIS 2.8.1. Soil data were not included because the information available for most countries in which the intention was to project the SDM (i.e., North African, Southwest Asian, and non-EU countries) did not have sufficient resolution to be useful in SDM at the scale considered in this study (i.e., the best global soil database available to date, the Harmonized World Soil Database v 1.2 from FAO, has a 5 arc-minute resolution).
