<p class="p">We projected the fitted SDM for the climatic conditions forecasted for 2050 and 2080 under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. RCP4.5 assumes an intermediate impact on climate change and is characterized by stabilization without overshoot to 4.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at stabilization after 2100. RCP8.5 has a severe impact on climate change and is characterized by a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in 2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. These scenarios were applied using the outputs from five different GCMs: ACCESS1-0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], CCSM4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], HadGEM2-CC [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], MPI-ESM-LR [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], and MRI-CGCM3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. These GCMs were downscaled and calibrated (bias corrected) using the WorldClim 1.4 climate as a baseline ‘current’ climate. For each date and emission scenario, we ensembled the projections obtained using the five GCMs. The projections were prepared into binary 1/0 (presence/absence) layers applying the model threshold. Then, the five thresholded projections were summed to obtain an ensemble map with pixel values ranging from 0 to 5 according to the number of GCMs that predict the presence of the species. Using this procedure, four maps were obtained, representing the combinations of two years (2050 and 2080) and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
