<p class="p">The analyses and results for white mustard reflect topo-climatic suitability (i.e., only climatic and topographic variables were considered), but the data for rapeseed reflect agro-ecological suitability (i.e., environmental and agronomical data were incorporated). Unless otherwise stated, for simplicity, the general term suitability is used in both cases. To determine geo-climatically suitable areas for white mustard growth in the Mediterranean Basin (ranging between 50.46째 N and 26.91째 N and -19.04째 W and 44.47째 W) under present and future conditions (2050 and 2080), species distribution modeling (SDM) was performed based on presence/absence data and environmental variables from the same localities.</p>
