<p class="p">To interpret model results, it is important to identify a threshold value above which model outputs accurately indicate the presence of a species [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. There are many ways to define this threshold. Sensitivity (true positive predictions vs. the number of actual positive sites) and specificity (true negative predictions vs. the number of actual negative sites) were plotted against a series of thresholds, and the threshold value was selected as the point at which the two curves crossed (

 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]). This procedure balances the cost of an incorrect decision and the benefit gained from a correct prediction [
