 <italic class="italic">alba</italic> was modeled using presence/absence data, which allows fitting and model evaluation without assuming pseudo-absences. Presence/absence data improve model performance over presence-only data [

 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. However, presence data for cultivated species in global databases are likely to contain many false presences in localities where the species is cultivated but would not be able to persist under natural climatic or edaphic conditions. Thus, during the late spring and early summer of 2013 and 2014, 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> geo-referenced presence/absence field data were obtained throughout the natural range of the species in the southern Iberian Peninsula [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. A total of 15 routes were surveyed, spanning approximately 3000 km. Systematic stops were made along each route at intervals of 3â€“10 km (typically 5 km), depending on the route characteristics (topography, land use, and type of roads), and the presence/absence of the species was registered. In total, 174 presences and 347 absences of the species were obtained (geographic coordinates are available online in supplementary material 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207124.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). The field monitoring did not involve collecting any plant material, and therefore, no specific permissions were required for visiting the studied locations. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.
