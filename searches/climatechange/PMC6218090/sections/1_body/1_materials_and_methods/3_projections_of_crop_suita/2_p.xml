<p class="p">For each year and greenhouse gas emission scenario, the forecast maps generated by GAEZ under the three GCMs were ensembled. The ensembles constructed in this case differ from the procedure we used to build the ensembles in the SDM of white mustard. First, we applied a threshold crop suitability index of 0.8 to the current and forecast maps. Then, the pixel values of the ensemble were recalculated on a scale from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate the number of GCMs predicting that a currently suitable pixel will become unsuitable for the species, 0 indicates that the species is not present currently or in the forecasted future according to all GCMs, and positive values indicate the number of GCMs predicting that a currently suitable pixel will remain suitable for the cultivation of the species. Using this procedure, four maps representing the combinations of two years (2050 and 2080) and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (A2 and B2) were obtained.</p>
