GAEZ is a very useful and contrasted tool that provides information about crop suitability, enabling the development of reliable models of the suitable area for rapeseed. GAEZ makes projections over a geopolitical spatial area based on country boundaries, which resulted in a projection area different from that used for white mustard, and this difference must be considered when comparing the predictions for each species. Climatic input variables for the model were average temperature, diurnal temperature range, sunshine fraction, wind speed at 10 m, relative humidity, wet‚Äêday frequency, and precipitation. Modeling generation options in GAEZ were set as follows: rain-fed water supply, high-level inputs/advanced management, CO

It should be noted that the predictions of CMIP3 have been overcome; accordingly, the lack of suitable area in the case of rapeseed should be interpreted as a conservative estimate. Similarly, climate change scenarios that were similar to RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 were used. According to Maloney et al. [
