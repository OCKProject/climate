<p class="p">Given the European deficit in gas and petroleum and the strong dependence on external fuel for automotive vehicles, agriculture, and industry, the development of alternative biofuel crops in Europe should be a priority for the energy policy of the European Commission, especially in the context of the strong projected reduction in suitable areas for cultivation of conventional energy crops. In particular, it is strategic for Southern Europe to develop biofuels from its own crops, adapted to Mediterranean environmental conditions and optimized for energy production. This is possible from native species of the Mediterranean region with high lipid contents in their seeds, such as white mustard, which can likely be genetically improved for this purpose, as demonstrated in sister taxa. According to Chalhoub et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], wild oilseed rape does not exist; this crop appears to have emerged as a hybrid due to human agricultural practices, and its subsequent evolution was influenced humans. It would be interesting to identify genetic lines of white mustard with high lipid contents and greater seed production and to optimize its cultivation to assure crop profitability. The competitive capacity or herbicide resistance must be addressed, since these traits are essential for the implementation of integrated and sustainable programs for the management of the flora associated with crops [
