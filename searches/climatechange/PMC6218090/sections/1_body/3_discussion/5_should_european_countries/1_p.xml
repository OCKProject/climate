 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, several factors limit the development of energy crops for biodiesel production in Southern Europe. There are ecological constraints to the establishment of oilseed crops from the most commonly used oilseed species (i.e., rapeseed, soybeans, and sunflowers). Recent studies based on current and future ecological niche models have predicted that the distribution of temperate crop species, such as oilseeds, cereals, starches, and solid biofuel crops (pruning, pellets, etc.), will increase in Northern Europe in the coming decades due to an increase in temperatures but will decrease in Southern Europe (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and the south of France) due to increased aridity [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. All models indicate that the Iberian Peninsula will be especially vulnerable to climate change, predicting that the cultivation of crop species adapted to temperate climates will decrease dramatically [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Thus, bioenergy crops in Southern Europe, and particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, may be seriously compromised unless action is taken to mitigate the effects of climate change [
