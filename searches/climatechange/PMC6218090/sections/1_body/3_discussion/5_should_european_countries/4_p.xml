<p class="p">In addition to agronomic aspects, it is important to account for the environmental impact of new crop species, especially for plants that are considered weeds. The distributions of many weeds have expanded or are predicted to expand in response to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], affecting crops and native plants, thereby generating important agronomic problems and impacts in native plant communities. Therefore, detailed agronomical, economical, and ecological studies are necessary when trying to grow a new species in a new area (especially if the species is considered a weed, as it is the case of white mustard), to deal with the agronomic and ecological problems that this could entail.
