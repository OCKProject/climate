<p class="p">The shift in the distribution of suitable areas for economically important crops is an enormous concern in relation to climate change [

In this study, we compared the current potential areas of cultivation in Europe and their predicted shifts in relation to climate change for two common mustards with economic value owing to their seed oil contents. We found that, while the current potential areas of cultivation are segregated, allowing for the complementary use of both species in different regions, future areas for rapeseed cultivation will retract considerably in Europe and areas for white mustard will expand in the northern Mediterranean Basin.
