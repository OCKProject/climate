<p class="p">We only sampled a portion of the entire distribution of white mustard; accordingly, our model may underestimate the suitable area for the species. However, the model prediction under the current climate closely matched the known native distribution of the species according to the Atlas of the European Flora (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]) and was concordant with the general climatic preferences that characterize the habitats of the species. White mustard is widely distributed around the Mediterranean Basin, showing two main potential areas of distribution, one on the southwestern coast of the Mediterranean and another in the eastern Mediterranean. Both areas are characterized by high aridity (high temperatures and low precipitation), especially during the summer. The rapeseed distribution model developed using GAEZ indicated that the current rapeseed distribution mainly includes Central and Eastern Europe (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207124.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Distribution models under current conditions show a lack of overlap in suitable areas for the cultivation of these two crop species, which makes the complementary cultivation of both species at the continental level feasible for biofuel production (see
