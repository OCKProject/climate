<p class="p">We compared the potential areas of cultivation for rapeseed and white mustard to determine the extent to which areas unsuitable for rapeseed in the future may be used for white mustard fuel production. The white mustard future projection models show an increase in suitable areas in Southern Europe, with the potential suitable area moving northward (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207124.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), avoiding the progressively adverse conditions in the southern parts of the Mediterranean. This would increase the suitable area of white mustard for biofuel production in Europe. Rapeseed future projection models also indicate an increase in suitable areas for cultivation. However, this increase in the suitable surface occurs to the northeast, moving mainly towards presently inhospitable areas of Siberia. By contrast, suitable areas in Central and Eastern Europe, where rapeseed is currently harvested, would decrease. In other words, current suitable areas for rapeseed crops will retract in Europe. This result agrees with those of Donatelli et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] for simulations of three major crops in Central and Eastern Europe; they showed that increasingly dry weather in 2030 would make it difficult to maintain rapeseed crops. Donatelli et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] showed that water stress might be a concern in parts of France, Germany, and the UK, where the 2020 projection anticipates a reduction of 5–30% in rapeseed yield, with further reductions in the 2030 projection. In another study [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], this increase in aridity was predicted to reduce the rapeseed oil concentration and seed yield. Nevertheless, this decrease in suitable areas for rapeseed in EU countries (averages of 16014 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> ha in 2050 and 26445 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> ha in 2080) would be clearly offset by the nearly 48 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> net hectares (average among different GCMs and emission scenarios for 2080) of climatically optimum area for white mustard predicted for the Mediterranean region. Thus, white mustard crops would not displace the rapeseed crops but could be planted in areas no longer suitable for rapeseed, enabling an enhanced total suitable area for bioenergy crops in Europe.
