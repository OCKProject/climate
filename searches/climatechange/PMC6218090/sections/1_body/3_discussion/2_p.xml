 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and the acid composition is analogous to those of other mustards, such as canola and soybean, used for biodiesel production. Likewise, the feasibility of the trans-esterification of polysaturated fatty acids to methyl ester for biodiesel has been demonstrated [

The results of this study combined with the potential for biodiesel production using white mustard suggest that more agronomic, ecological, and environmental research focused on this species is needed to promote its use as an alternative to rapeseed for biofuel production in Europe.
