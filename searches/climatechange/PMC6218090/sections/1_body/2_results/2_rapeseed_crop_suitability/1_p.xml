We observed increases in suitable areas almost exclusively in the northeast, mainly in currently unsuitable areas of Siberia. By contrast, Central and Eastern Europe will lose suitable areas for rapeseed cultivation under future climate scenarios. In particular, this decrease in southern areas would be around 70000 × 10

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> ha of currently suitable land to grow rapeseed), the four ensemble forecasts show a net reduction in suitable areas of an average of 16000 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> ha in 2050 and 26400 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> ha in 2080, or 11.3% of currently suitable land in EU countries in 2050 and 18.7% in 2080.
