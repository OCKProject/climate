<p class="p">The model projection under current conditions showed two main potential areas suitable for white mustard cultivation, one on the southwest coast of the Mediterranean (including the southern Iberian Peninsula, northern Morocco and Algeria, and Tunisia) and the other in the eastern Mediterranean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207124.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Ensemble projections for the future distributions (2050 and 2080) suggest a displacement of the potential suitable area to the north. In 2050, the expansion would be substantial in northern Algeria, northeastern Morocco, Mediterranean Europe, the Bengasi coast, the north coast of Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula, the Near East coast, and western Georgia (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207124.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). In 2080, the most remarkable change in distribution is the consolidation of the Mediterranean region as the optimum climatic area for the cultivation of the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207124.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), increasing the suitable area to the north, especially considering the more drastic GCMs and emission scenarios. We also observed increases in the Bengasi coast, the north coast of Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula, the Near East coast, and west of Georgia, but to a lesser extent than those in 2050. The extent of suitable areas are expected to decrease in the interior part of the Gulf of Gabes, the north coast of Algeria, and the areas of confluence of Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia (
