<p class="p">In this study, we model the suitable potential area for white mustard in the Mediterranean Basin under current and future climatic conditions using different general circulation models (GCMs) and emission scenarios. We also explore the suitable areas for rapeseed cultivation according to a crop model made using Global Agro-Ecological Zones (a FAO resource for crop suitability distributions; GAEZ hereafter [
 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]). We address the following questions. (1) Do currently suitable areas for rapeseed and white mustard overlap, making them potentially alternative crops in the same zone, or are they complementary at the continental level? (2) Will the distribution of suitable areas for these species expand or retract in Europe during the 21st century under different climate change scenarios? (3) Given the projected suitable areas for the cultivation of these species, should European countries focus on the research and development of white mustard oilseeds as an alternative to rapeseed for biofuel production in Europe?
