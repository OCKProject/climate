<p class="p">Oilseed crops, like other crops, are facing the effects of climate change. In particular, temperature increase and precipitation reduction are important climatic factors determining yield and seed oil concentration [

There is therefore a need to investigate alternative energy crops preadapted to future temperatures and precipitation levels predicted by climate change models. Despite studies of the production of biodiesel and other biofuels from alternative species, especially in the agronomic and technological fields (i.e., [
