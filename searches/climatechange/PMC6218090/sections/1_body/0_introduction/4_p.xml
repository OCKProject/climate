 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Rapeseed is an annual herb from relatively cool and humid temperate climates. In 2008 in Europe, rapeseed accounted for 79% of all feedstock crops used for biodiesel production [

 <xref rid="pone.0207124.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Global warming and associated increases in aridity in many temperate regions where they are currently cultivated may nonetheless compromise crop production. To meet future oilseed demand, a potential approach is the development of new alternative crops of oilseed mustards that are naturally adapted to more xeric conditions. Mediterranean climate regions of the world are hardly adequate for the optimum cultivation of rapeseed [

However, potentially suitable areas for the cultivation of white mustard are unknown; thus the extent to which white mustard could complement the current and future areas of rapeseed cultivation is unknown. This is important since global warming will impact the distribution and suitability of other economically important crops (i.e., [
