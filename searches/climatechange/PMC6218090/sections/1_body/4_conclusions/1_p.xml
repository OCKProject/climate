<p class="p">Our model forecast that climate change will cause the loss of thousands of hectares of suitable land for bioenergy production using rapeseed in Europe. A candidate crop to replace rapeseed is white mustard, which is adapted to Mediterranean environmental conditions. According to our models, its suitable area for cultivation will expand throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Central Europe. It has good potential as a biofuel crop and could be genetically improved. Moreover, our model clearly shows that the suitable areas for rapeseed and white mustard do not overlap in the present or in the future. Therefore, white mustard could replace rapeseed for biofuel production in areas that become unsuitable for rapeseed in the near future.</p>
