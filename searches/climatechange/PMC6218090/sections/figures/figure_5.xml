  <title class="title">Ensemble forecast maps of rapeseed suitability based on three GCMs for combinations of year and greenhouse gas emission scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">a) 2050 and B2 emission scenario, b) 2050 and A2 emission scenario, c) 2080 and B2 emission scenario, and d) 2080 and A2 emission scenario. Suitability is represented on a scale from -3 to 3, where negative values indicate the number of GCMs predicting that a currently suitable pixel will become unsuitable for the species, 0 indicates that the species is not present currently or in the future according to all GCMs, and positive values indicate the number of GCMs predicting that a currently suitable pixel will remain suitable for the cultivation of the species.</p>
