For example, in 88% (125 million hectares (Mha)) of rice-harvested croplands the relationship was significant but only in 54% (22 Mha) of sorghum harvested areas globally. Within North and Central America recent climate change impact was consequently significant over 89% of maize but 71% of wheat-harvested areas (
