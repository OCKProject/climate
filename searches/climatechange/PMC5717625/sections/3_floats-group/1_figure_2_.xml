  <p class="p">Structural equation interaction model. (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) Conceptual model describing proposed interactions between abiotic drivers, species, species groups and trophic levels predicted under the pulse-reserve paradigm and knowledge of the factors influencing the abundance and spatial dynamics of Australian desert systems. (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) Results from SEM for the same model quantifying significant interactions. Values above the drawings are percentage deviances explained. Standardized path coefficients are shown for each arrow, and arrow thickness is proportional to effect size and represents significant path coefficients (
   <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; 0.05). Non-significant interactions are not shown. Artwork by A. Foster. *Interaction term between dingo numbers and population phase of rodent prey.
