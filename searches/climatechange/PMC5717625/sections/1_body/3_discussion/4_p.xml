<p class="p">There was no direct relationship between spinifex seed productivity and cumulative rainfall, but the results suggest that rainfall indirectly influenced seed production through the growth of spinifex hummocks. As a group, reptiles were influenced by wildfire and number of rain days, but surprisingly not by spinifex cover, even though spinifex can be completely removed by wildfire. The grouping of reptiles above the species level may have masked more subtle processes and differences in responses by individual species, especially as these responses can be divergent [

Thus, we suggest that wildfire and other processes, such as predation or food [
