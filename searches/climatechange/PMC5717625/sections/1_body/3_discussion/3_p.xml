<p class="p">The interaction between the top predator, the dingo and the population phase of its prey had a negative effect on the introduced mesopredators, the red fox and feral cat. This suggests that the strength of top-down effects on the mesopredators was strongest in the ‘bust’ and ‘decline’ phases of their shared rodent prey [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The positive association between dingoes and feral cats may reflect simultaneous increases in both populations during ‘boom’ conditions driven by rainfall-led productivity pulses. Conversely, there was no direct association between dingoes and red foxes. This suggests that foxes have a longer lag-time in responding to prey populations, perhaps because they are not always present in the desert system and migrate in from more mesic areas around the study region post-rain [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Further support for the slower response due to migration can be found in the negative association between phase and red foxes. During the ‘bust’ phase of rodent prey, red foxes can become undetectable, while dingoes and feral cats can persist in low numbers [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Red fox numbers were not influenced by rodent captures, suggesting that the red fox has a more flexible diet than the feral cat [
