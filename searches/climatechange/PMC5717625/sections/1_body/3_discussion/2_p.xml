<p class="p">As predicted from our 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> model based on the pulse-reserve paradigm, higher rainfall resulted in significantly increased captures of small mammals via changes in food resources (seeds) and also led to increased captures of reptiles. As expected, the dominant vegetation cover, spinifex, increased with rainfall and with years since wildfire. While spinifex seed production also increased predictably with the cover of the parent plant, increases in the cover of spinifex provide fuel for wildfires [

However, these flow-on effects differed between rodents and dasyurids. As predicted, native rodents appeared to be limited by top-down effects from introduced predators (feral cats and red foxes), whereas populations of small dasyurids exhibited a response to the native mulgara, a larger dasyurid predator.
