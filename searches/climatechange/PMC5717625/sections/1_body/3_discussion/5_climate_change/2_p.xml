<p class="p">Consistent with our prediction, an increase in vegetation cover stimulated by the higher rainfall projected for central Australia was offset by increases in wildfire frequency, leading to a predicted decrease in the dominant plant cover, spinifex, over the next 100 years. Such a decrease would suggest a shift to smaller and younger spinifex plants and, in turn, a reduction in reproductive output, thus illustrating that the interaction between abiotic drivers and vegetation can have complex effects. Abrupt climate change can lead to rapid shifts in the vegetation community. For example, both charcoal and pollen samples show that sudden changes in climate can increase fire activity and swiftly drive shifts in vegetation structure and composition [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] found that climate change decreased the time between wildfires and placed vegetation on a trajectory from wooded towards shrub-dominated landscapes. After wildfire in spinifex grasslands, there is an increase in cover of annual and perennial vegetation [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]), changes in rainfall and fire frequency may lead to a large-scale shift in the cover of the dominant vegetation and increases in annual and perennial species across central and northern arid regions of Australia, further contributing to global vegetation alteration.
