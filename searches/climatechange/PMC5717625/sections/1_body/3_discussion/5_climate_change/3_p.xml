<p class="p">Contrarily, rodent abundance was not predicted to change along with decreases in spinifex seeding under the modelled climate change scenario. The weak link between spinifex seed and rodents could have four possible causes. Firstly, rodents may be able to supplement their food with seed from other plant species, or invertebrates. For example, Murray &amp; Dickman [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] found some dietary switching, especially in the Austral autumn, when invertebrates could make up to 60% of the diets of some desert rodents. Secondly, during resource pulses, the increase in spinifex seed may be in excess of what is required for rodent populations to irrupt. For example, rodent populations in central Australia respond when a rainfall threshold is reached and, beyond this, there is likely to be an excess of food [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. However, given their fast reproductive rates and rapid population responses to rainfall events, rodents could be expected to maximize their response to the available food supply. In addition, rapid population declines after resource pulses occur in desert systems, suggesting that competition for food may be operating [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Thirdly, the spinifex seed index may be a coarse measure of seed output; spinifex can undergo infrequent mast seeding events, resulting in weak links between spinifex cover and seed output [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Lastly, rodent populations may be limited by predation from introduced predators. Introduced predators often depredate rodents and other native mammals more heavily than do native predators [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and are one of the key drivers of extinction of Australian mammals [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Thus, when mammalian predators were removed from our model, there was an increase in the mean predicted captures of rodents that was most pronounced when only the introduced predators were removed. Although the dingo will eat rodents, this native species prefers to hunt other, larger prey, than the introduced fox and cat [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. The ostensibly paradoxical result that the increase in rodent captures is lower with no predators than it is when dingoes are present (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS170384F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) may reflect two possibilities: it could be an artefact of the model that arose from a transitory but unrepresentative positive effect of dingoes on rodents during the limited 2-year timeframe of the camera deployment. This seems unlikely, as the potential positive effects of dingoes on rodents have been documented broadly in other desert studies [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. More likely, the model result reflects compensatory survival or reproductive responses by rodents, with animals that remain after limited off-take by dingoes experiencing reduced social pressure and prolonged reproduction [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Whatever the case, it is clear that predation from introduced species limits prey populations compared with changing abiotic conditions from climate change. Introduced predators quickly exploit the open areas created after wildfire [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], and the projected decrease in vegetation cover from climate change may provide a negative feedback loop that allows increased predation from introduced predators on rodents and other native prey.
