<p class="p">The SEM framework made it possible to integrate multiple long-term datasets from our studies in central Australia and to make predictions about the effects of direct and indirect interactions among existing species [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. This is the first time this has been possible using such an extensive empirical dataset on a highly diverse biotic assemblage. However, we suggest that the framework can be enhanced still further. Firstly, the SEM framework did not account for novel interactions. For example, invasive species such as the European rabbit (
 <italic class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) and house mouse (
 <italic class="italic">Mus musculus</italic>) are largely absent in our study region, but increases in the magnitude and frequency of large (greater than 90th quantile) rainfall events may allow these species to establish [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The influence of these introduced species on vegetation and predator populations should be the focus of future research. Secondly, weak interactions may not be well represented in our model, but they can have important effects on the overall stability of food webs [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Thirdly, the sensitively of the model predictions could be tested by running other climate change scenarios not considered here. Lastly, little is known about other important components of the community, such as invertebrates, birds and interactions between reptile, dasyurid and eutherian predators (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]), or processes such as nutrient cycling. For example, interactions between introduced predators and small native dasyurid predators are largely unstudied and hard to predict. We suggest that these areas be foci for further research.
