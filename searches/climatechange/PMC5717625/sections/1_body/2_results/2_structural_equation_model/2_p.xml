 <italic class="italic">b</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S3). Insectivorous dasyurids were influenced by both spatial and bottom-up effects from the mean rainfall event size two months prior, but also negatively associated with top-down effects from the predatory mulgara (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) were not significant; spinifex cover was not associated with reptile captures, mulgara captures were not associated with rodent numbers or year since wildfire, and the spinifex seed index was not associated with eight-month cumulative rainfall. Prey population phase was not associated with feral cat abundance, and there was no direct effect of dingoes on red foxes (

 <italic class="italic">b</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S3). There was a positive effect of dingoes on feral cats, but the interaction of phase and dingo was negative on both feral cats and foxes (
