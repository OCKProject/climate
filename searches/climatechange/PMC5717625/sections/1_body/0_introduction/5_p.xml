<p class="p">Climate also plays a key role in driving other abiotic processes that influence species populations, as exemplified by the pulse-reserve paradigm that applies in many arid environments [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The pulse-reserve paradigm states that deserts are water-limited and predicts that consumer populations should respond positively to pulses of rainfall through bottom-up processes [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For example, infrequent rainfall events can lead to pulses in primary production and flow-on to increases in consumer populations that structure both populations and assemblages [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. More recently, research in arid regions has shown that these environments can exhibit both bottom-up and top-down control of species populations, and climate conditions frequently alter the timing and intensity of trophic connections [
