<p class="p">Climate change has the potential to increase or decrease the strength of interactions and the effects of other ecological processes. Climate change may have different effects if the interactions or processes are positive or negative, leading to unpredictable changes in the composition of species assemblages. Identifying the importance of particular biotic interactions and other processes within broader networks is difficult, particularly when multiple trophic levels are involved, but can be useful for detecting the first evidence of environmental change [
