<p class="p">Pulses of productivity from global climate cycles also increase fuel loads. For example, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle drives wildfires across the Americas and Oceania [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]; such events are currently increasing in frequency and magnitude [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Temperatures, and hence evaporation rates, in central Australia have also increased over the last 100 years, further exacerbating the likelihood of more frequent and intense wildfires [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In addition to changes in species interactions, such dramatic climate shifts are likely to accelerate the global risks of extinction for many species and ecosystems. Recent analyses suggest that these risks are greater for South America and Australia than for other continental regions [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], with many taxa in Australia's central arid regions being particularly vulnerable [
