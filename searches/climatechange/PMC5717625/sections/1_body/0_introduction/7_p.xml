<p class="p">Phenomenological models provide a useful framework for modelling ecological interactions and processes, and thus can help to improve our understanding of complex ecological systems [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Within phenomenological models, researchers can use a combination of existing theory, such as the pulse-reserve paradigm [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], and data to predict species' responses to climate change. While the pulse-reserve paradigm predicts rain-driven increases in productivity and consumer populations, top-down effects from predators may limit the population growth of consumers through predation and also reduce population growth among themselves via interference competition [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In general, introduced predators are predicted to cause population declines of consumers due to the usually elevated effects of their predation on native fauna [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Climate shifts that modify the pulse-reserve system can be expected to have flow-on effects that will further influence biota via both bottom-up and top-down processes. In semi-arid grassland communities in central California, for example, increased rainfall has been found to alter the strength of both consumer-resource and facilitative interactions, even reversing the direction of effects in some cases [
