 <xref rid="RSOS170384C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. They drive the dynamics of species populations and key processes such as nutrient cycling, and facilitate plant–pollinator networks and predator–prey relationships. Interactions can occur locally between pairs of species, but also may exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics across multiple scales [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Importantly, species interactions can be modified by climate [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], with recent work suggesting that one species in six is at risk of extinction due to global climate change [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. To date, most studies have investigated non-interactive effects of climate change across trophic levels and focus on single or independent multiple processes [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], or explore the ecology of individual species or groups of species using habitat or niche modelling and dispersal capacities. Biotic interactions are usually ignored [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], even though such interactions can profoundly alter how biota respond to climate change (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]). These observations make it imperative for ecologists to investigate how the interactive effects of multiple population processes affect the diversity and functioning of ecosystems [
