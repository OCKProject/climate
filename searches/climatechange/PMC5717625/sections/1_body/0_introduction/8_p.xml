<p class="p">Here, we explore how species in multiple trophic levels interact with each other and with dynamically varying environmental drivers in a case study arid system, and investigate how stresses from global climate change may modify already-complex interaction networks. We first construct a conceptual phenomenological model based on central Australian biota that captures the key interactions and processes that operate there, and then apply structural equation modelling (SEM) using actual data on these biota to quantify how they are affected by key system processes. We base our phenomenological model on the pulse-reserve paradigm and the interactions derived by top-down forcing from predators. We parametrize the model using long-term (17â€“22 year) regional-scale datasets on rainfall, vegetation cover, time-since-wildfire, captures of small mammals and reptiles, and a shorter-term (2 year) dataset on both a native mammalian top predator and two species of smaller introduced predators. We then use the results from the structural equation model to make the following predictions, in line with future climate projections for central Australia [
