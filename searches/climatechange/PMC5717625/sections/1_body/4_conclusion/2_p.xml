<p class="p">The population responses among the diverse desert-dwelling biota that we studied may be influenced by both bottom-up and top-down drivers as predicted by the pulse-reserve paradigm. For mammal populations, which have been depleted more than any other component of Australia's diverse inland vertebrate assemblages [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], our results indicate that declines in a key food and shelter resource—spinifex—are of far less import than the impacts of introduced predators under future climate change scenarios. Although our SEM models did not account for all possible interactions as they brought together 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> knowledge about individual species and systems, our analyses suggest that these models can yield novel and powerful insights into the functioning of diverse ecological systems. For our system in particular, we found that while vegetation cover can be expected to decline due to climate change, the primary influence on prey populations is top-down suppression from introduced predators.
