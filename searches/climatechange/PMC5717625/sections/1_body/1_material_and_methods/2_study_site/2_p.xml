<p class="p">The study was conducted in the Simpson Desert, central Australia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS170384F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). This region occupies 170 000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; dune fields comprise 73% of the region, with smaller areas consisting of clay pans, rocky outcrops and gibber flats [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The sand dunes run parallel in a north–south direction aligned with the prevailing southerly wind. The dunes are up to 10 m high and 0.6–1 km apart [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Vegetation in the interdune swales and on dune sides is predominantly spinifex grassland (
 <italic class="italic">Triodia basedowii</italic>) with patchy cover of small stands of gidgee trees (
 <italic class="italic">Acacia georginae</italic>) and other woody 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> shrubs or mallee eucalypts; low-lying clay pans fill with water temporarily after heavy rain [
