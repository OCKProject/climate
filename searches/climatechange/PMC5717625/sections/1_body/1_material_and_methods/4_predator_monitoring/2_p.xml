<p class="p">We monitored the activity of a top predator, the dingo (
 <italic class="italic">Canis dingo</italic>), and two species of smaller predator (or ‘mesopredator’), the introduced feral cat (
 <italic class="italic">Felis catus</italic>) and red fox (
 <italic class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</italic>), at each site as described in Greenville 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In brief, 25 remote cameras were in continuous operation from April 2010 to April 2012 and adequately surveyed the three predator populations across both a resource pulse (‘boom’) and subsequent ‘bust’ event in the study region [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. We pooled the numbers of photographs of each predator species from these cameras each month at each site (see [
