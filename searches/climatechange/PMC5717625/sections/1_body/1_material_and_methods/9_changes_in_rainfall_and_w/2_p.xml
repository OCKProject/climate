<p class="p">To determine how the two key drivers, rainfall and wildfire, may influence interactions and processes between trophic groups under a changing climate, we simulated projected changes in years since wildfire and cumulative eight-month rainfall 100 years into the future. We generated a current rainfall scenario for 2000 samples from the negative binomial distribution, using parameters estimated from actual eight-month cumulative rainfall data measured by on-site weather stations (
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> = 152, size = 1.57, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2000). Extreme rainfall events (greater than 95th quantile) have increased in frequency and magnitude over the last approximately 100 years in the Simpson Desert, leading to an approximate increase of 4 mm per year on average [

 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> = 419, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2000; see electronic supplementary material, table S2). The negative binomial distribution was chosen over the Poisson as rainfall in arid environments is over-dispersed due to large numbers of nil or small rainfall events per year. Histograms were used to confirm that simulated datasets had similar distributions to actual rainfall datasets (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Changes in future rainfall are uncertain, but our rainfall parameters are all within projected changes for central Australia, mainly due to expected increases in extreme rainfall events [
