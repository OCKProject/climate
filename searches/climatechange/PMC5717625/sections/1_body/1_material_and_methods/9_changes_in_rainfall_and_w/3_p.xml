 <xref rid="RSOS170384C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To simulate a reduction in the years since wildfire across the next 100 years, we used a negative binomial distribution and generated a current wildfire scenario based on parameter estimates from the actual wildfire data (
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> = 21, size = 3.34, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2000). We assumed that in 100 years, the mean time between wildfires would change from 21 to 10 years (
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> = 10, size = 3.34, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2000) and generated 12 time steps over the next 100 years (see electronic supplementary material, table S2). All mean years since wildfire parameters used are within reported fire return intervals for central Australia [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. As for rainfall, we used histograms to confirm that simulated datasets had similar distributions to those for actual wildfires (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).
