 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS170384F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>), and predicted values for each trophic level were re-entered at each node from spinifex cover, then spinifex seed and lastly the rodent node. In addition, to test the influence of top-down effects from introduced predators, we constructed three scenarios: firstly, with all mammalian predators using existing predator datasets; secondly, without the introduced red fox and feral cat; and thirdly, without any mammalian predators. Models were run 2000 times, except for the rodent models where predator datasets were smaller due to predator monitoring using remote camera traps running for only 2 years (
