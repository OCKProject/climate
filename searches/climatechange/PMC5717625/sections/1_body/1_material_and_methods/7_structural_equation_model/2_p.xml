<p class="p">To investigate the species interactions and processes in our system, we built a phenomenological model using a graph-theoretic approach to SEM. Each species or species group was entered as a node and the direction of the arrow represented a hypothesised causal pathway or direct interaction (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). This approach is not based on a global covariance matrix; rather, each node is modelled separately, allowing different statistical techniques to be used for local estimation [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Thus, we derived nine separate models, totalling 26 direct interactions or processes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170384TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, table S1). We investigated the effect of the predictor variables on small mammal and reptile captures by using a Poisson generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), with an offset for the number of trapping nights to account for unequal trapping effort (total sampling effort pooled across all nine sites for each model: rodents: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 103; dasyurids: 
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 1118; mulgara: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1386, reptiles: 
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 911; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170384TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, S1). Because the same trapping grid or remote camera was sampled each trip, it (trip) was added as the random factor to account for observations repeated over time [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. We modelled the effects of the predictor variables on spinifex cover and seed as proportional odds, and a binomial GLMM was used (total sampling effort pooled across all nine sites for each model: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 774 and 773, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170384TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, S1). Lastly, we modelled 2 years of predator data from remote camera traps using a Poisson GLMM, with the number of nights each camera was operational used as an offset to account for camera malfunctions (total sampling effort pooled across all nine sites for each model: 
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 114; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170384TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, S1). Pitfall captures or numbers of photographs of mulgara, feral cat, red fox, dingo and rodents entered as predictor variables were standardized for sampling effort (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS170384TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>). Because only 2 years of feral cat, red fox and dingo data were available, only the corresponding 2 years of rodent pitfall trapping could be used in this submodel.
