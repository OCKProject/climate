<p class="p">Previous research in the study region has found that the strength of top predator suppression on the two species of mesopredator is influenced by the population phase of their shared rodent prey [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Therefore, we entered population phase (boom, decline and bust; coded as 1, 2, 3) and the interaction between dingoes and population phase (phase) into the model following the approach and findings of Greenville

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. We calculated standardized coefficients for each pathway by computing the change in the response variable from its predicted minimum value to its predicted maximum value, adjusted for the response's maximum range [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Owing to the various dataset lengths and the inclusion of mixed effects, global model fits for a piecewise SEM could not be calculated. Instead, we determined the relative fit of each local model by calculating the percentage deviance explained (deviance for the null model minus the deviance of the fitted model, divided by the deviance of the null model) [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], an approach that has been used successfully in past studies using SEMs [
