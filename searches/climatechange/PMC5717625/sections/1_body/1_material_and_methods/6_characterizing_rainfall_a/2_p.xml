<p class="p">Daily rainfall data from automatic weather stations (Environdata, Warwick, Queensland, Australia) located at each site were used to calculate rainfall variables: total rainfall for each trapping month, number of rain days, mean rainfall per day, mean and maximum event size and rainfall lags for each month up to a year (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Cumulative rainfall in the previous two months up to that in the previous 12 months was also calculated. Rainfall variables identified as important predictors for mammals and reptiles are number of rain days in a month and the mean rainfall-event size lagged two trips prior [
