<p class="p">To measure the cover of the dominant vegetation (spinifex, 
 <italic class="italic">T. basedowii</italic>), we visually scored the percentage cover in a 2.5 m radius around six traps at each trapping grid that was used to sample small vertebrates. In addition, a seed index (0–5, where 0 represents no seeding present and 5 represents every plant bearing maximum seed) was used to score spinifex seed production. Spinifex seed was chosen due to its dominance in the landscape and because it is an important component of the diets of both main species of study rodent,

 <italic class="italic">P. hermannsburgensis</italic>, representing up to 52% of their diet by occurrence [
