<p class="p">The proposed causal pathways between variables in the conceptual model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS170384F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) were determined by our 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> knowledge of predator–prey dynamics, the pulse-reserve paradigm and prior knowledge of the factors influencing the abundance and spatial dynamics of Australian desert systems. Both bottom-up and top-down effects can operate in arid systems [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and thus are incorporated into the model. We chose rainfall, wildfire and spatial driver variables based on our prior knowledge of Australian desert systems (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]). Captures across sites were pooled for rodents, the small carnivorous mulgara (
 <italic class="italic">D. blythi</italic>), and reptiles, as spatial population synchrony is exhibited for these groups, but not for smaller, insectivorous dasyurid marsupials [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Under the pulse-reserve paradigm, it was hypothesized that changes in spinifex cover would influence spinifex seed production, as larger plants (greater cover) could compete more successfully for resources and produce more seeds or have more successful seeding events. Rodents consume large amounts of spinifex seed, and seeding events are positively associated with population increases [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Even though Australian rodents consume higher levels of invertebrates than in other desert regions, invertebrate prey show a variable response to rainfall and thus we hypothesize that spinifex seed production is the most important factor influencing population irruptions [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Increases in rodent populations lead in turn to increases in predator populations, but predation pressure on rodents may differ between native and non-native predators [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. For example, Greenville

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] found no predatory effects of the native mulgara on rodent populations, but feral cats and the introduced red fox can force populations to extinction across Australia [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In addition, rodents can form an important component in the diet of the dingo, but the number of rodents consumed per day was highest for the introduced cat and fox [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. We did not include a pathway between the feral cat and introduced red fox, as previous research suggested that there was no interaction between these two species in our study system [
 <xref rid="RSOS170384C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Reptile populations can be influenced by spinifex cover, wildfire and number of rain days [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Populations of small dasyurids differ across space and can be influenced by both bottom-up effects from rainfall and top-down effects from the predatory mulgara [

 <xref rid="RSOS170384C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Wildfire, spinifex cover and rodent captures (prey) are important drivers for mulgara populations [
