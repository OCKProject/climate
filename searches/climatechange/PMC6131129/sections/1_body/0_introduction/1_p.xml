<p id="Par10" class="p">Annual floods in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta not only bring great benefits for local inhabitants and the regional economy but also constitute a major safety risk (Hoa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2008</xref>; MDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). Located in the downstream reach of the Mekong River (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the Mekong River Delta (hereafter, the Mekong Delta) receives about 475 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of upstream inflow annually (MRC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2005</xref>). About 70–80% of this flow volume comes during the wet season (July–December), causing widespread flooding across the floodplains. Floodwater, especially the overland water flow, generates multiple benefits for natural ecosystems, fisheries and agriculture (Arias et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2013</xref>; Chapman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2016</xref>). These benefits include providing migration routes and breeding sites for fish species, distributing nutrient-rich sediment for agriculture, recharging ground water aquifers and controlling sea-water intrusion. Despite these abundant benefits, extreme floods also cause losses of human lives and severe damages to crops and infrastructures (Västilä et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2010</xref>; Van et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2012</xref>). For example, the historic flood in 2000, a 50-year flood with estimated economic losses of over US$ 200 million, illustrates the delta’s high vulnerability to extreme floods (Cosslett and Cosslett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>). Given the valuable benefits and severe flood damages, flood management in the Mekong Delta requires effectively controlling excessive floodwater without compromising the flood benefits and other development objectives (Käkönen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2011</xref>).
