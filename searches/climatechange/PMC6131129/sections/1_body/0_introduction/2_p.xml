<p id="Par11" class="p">Flood management in the Mekong Delta, however, is facing critical challenges caused by climate change and accelerating socioeconomic developments (MDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). Challenges are defined here as factors or processes that can hinder successful planning and implementation of flood management activities. Flood hazards are projected to increase substantially under future climate change due to higher upstream inflow and downstream sea-level rise (Wassmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2004</xref>; Nguyen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>). These increasing flood hazards are expected to exceed the delta’s current coping capacity and thus constitute a major threat for safety and sustainable development (Thanh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2004</xref>; Wassmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2004</xref>). Furthermore, prevalent uncertainties in the future flood hazards also hamper long-term planning and investments for flood management (MDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>; Trung and Thanh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2013</xref>). Accelerating socioeconomic developments including economic and population growths, land-use change and infrastructural developments (e.g. building dikes and hydropower dams) also introduce new management challenges. Population in the Mekong basin increased from 63 million to 72 million during the 1995–2005 period, and a further increase of 60% is projected by 2050 (Pech and Sunada 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2008</xref>). The agriculture sector also experienced similar trends, with irrigated rice area increasing more than three times during 1975–1994 in the An Giang Province—one of the development hot spots in the Mekong Delta (Käkönen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). All these developments will likely exert extra pressures on the Mekong Delta’s water system including flood risks.
