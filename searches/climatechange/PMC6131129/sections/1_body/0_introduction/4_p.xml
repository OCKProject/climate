<p id="Par14" class="p">Despite numerous studies on flood risks and management in the Mekong Delta (see an overview of recent studies in Supplementary Material

In many cases, emphasis is still placed on finding the ‘right’ technical solutions, following the conventional flood management approach (e.g. Lebel and Sinh

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2014</xref>). The number of flood management studies explicitly including climate change and socioeconomic developments, on the other hand, remains limited (see also "
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Systematic literature review</xref>" section on literature review and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>A). As a result, the questions of which challenges are more critical in the changing flood management context and how to effectively overcome them using a mix of different types of solutions (i.e. strategies) remain largely unaddressed. In addition, little is known about how existing challenges manifest and to what extent new challenges arise due to climate change and socioeconomic developments. These important knowledge gaps need to be addressed to effectively inform and support flood management in the Mekong Delta to deal with climate change and rapid socioeconomic developments.
