 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2011</xref>) during the early 1990s, the delta’s economic structure has developed from a rice-based economy towards a more diversified system with growing contributions from fishery, aquaculture, horticulture, services, trade and industry (Huynh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2008</xref>; Thai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2008</xref>). This diversified economy requires pursuing multiple, sometimes competing, flood management objectives (Käkönen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>; Renaud and Küenzer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2012</xref>). Reflecting on these objectives, Käkönen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Pham (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2011</xref>) questioned the suitability of the current technology-centric flood management approach to spontaneously secure flood safety and sustain flood benefits. This and other challenges experienced in flood management were also reported in the recent literature, including technical difficulties (Hoa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2008</xref>; MDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>), limited resources and capacity (Bastakoti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2014</xref>; Hoa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014a</xref>), and governance and institutional constraints (Waibel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2012</xref>; MDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). Without timely solutions, the challenges can hamper flood management efforts, thereby creating serious consequences for the people and the economy of the Mekong Delta (MDP
