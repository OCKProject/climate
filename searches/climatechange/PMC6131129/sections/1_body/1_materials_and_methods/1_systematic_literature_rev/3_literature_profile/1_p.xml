The focal topics, spatial levels and publication types of the reviewed literature are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. All the reviewed documents date between 2000 and 2017. Topic-wise, the literature exhibits relatively equal coverages of different flood management aspects. Flood modelling, monitoring and early warning are most frequently reported (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 27) while building flood resilience topic shows the lowest coverage (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 13). Regarding spatial levels, a majority (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 41) of the included documents focuses on the delta-wide level. Flood management at the sub-delta levels (i.e. regional, provincial, local and individual households), however, receives less attention, shown by markedly fewer documents.
