<p id="Par30" class="p">We identified a relatively large set of flood management solutions from expert surveys and further analysed how these individual solutions can be configured into key thematic strategies for implementation. Overall, the identified solutions exhibit a remarkable degree of diversity in terms of their quantity (114 in total) and objectives. These solutions address different aspects of flood-risk management, ranging from infrastructural and technical interventions to mobilizing and developing capacities and resources. A complete inventory of solutions is presented in Supplementary Material 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-1009-4" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S3-a</ext-link>. Despite this remarkable diversity, the identified flood management solutions also exhibit several generic patterns. First, the solutions show differentiated levels of priority for implementation, where certain solutions are recommended more often by the experts. The most frequently recommended solutions include “
 <italic class="italic">Promote exchange and learning</italic>”, “
 <italic class="italic">Implement integrated flood impacts assessment</italic>”, “
 <italic class="italic">Improve collaboration between stakeholders</italic>”, “
 <italic class="italic">Improve communication</italic>”, and “
 <italic class="italic">Build capacity for flood management staffs</italic>”. Second, while these top-prioritized solutions show a strong focus on management and capacity aspects, many infrastructural measures are also considered important for the Mekong Delta (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Main infrastructural measures include “
 <italic class="italic">Optimize the existing flood control infrastructures</italic>”, “
 <italic class="italic">Develop new technical measures for flood management</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">Address the unwanted impacts of existing flood management infrastructures</italic>”. A relatively good mix of hard and soft solutions as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> emphasizes the importance of combining multiple solutions to address the increasing flood risks in the Mekong Delta.
