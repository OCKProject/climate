<p id="Par27" class="p">Results from the expert survey further indicate that many flood management challenges are considered to be very important (12 out of 19), and they tend to arise from the current governance and institutional settings in the Mekong Delta. Furthermore, 89% of the experts indicated that flood management has become more challenging comparing to three decades ago and they attribute the reasons to population growth (77%), dikes construction (70%), land-use change (68%), hydropower dam construction (68%), climate change (62%) and sea level rise (54%). In addition, experts’ evaluation clearly differentiated the challenges by their importance levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The top-five challenges according to all experts were: 
 <italic class="italic">C2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Existing flood protection measures create unwanted impacts</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">C8</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Some factors causing flood are outside management boundary, i.e. in other country, province or district;</italic> C9—
 <italic class="italic">Limited coordination and collaboration in flood management across provinces and districts</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">C10</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Conflicting interests between different management departments and regions</italic>; and 
 <italic class="italic">C13</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Flood management system is not responsive to new issues and challenges</italic>. Notably, four out of the top-five challenges belong to group G2—governance and institutional challenges, making this group the most predominant one compared to the other groups. These challenges were consistently reported by experts from all occupations, working levels and working focuses, suggesting that they are commonly experienced across multiple spatial levels and at different aspects of flood management.
