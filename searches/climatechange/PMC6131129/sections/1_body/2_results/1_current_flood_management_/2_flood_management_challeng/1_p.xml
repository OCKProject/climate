<p id="Par26" class="p">We identified 19 flood management challenges (C1–C19) from the literature and further verified them with our expert panel (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Overall, the identified challenges are diverse and relate to different flood management aspects. They were grouped (G1–G3) into G1—Technical challenges (C1–C7); G2—Governance and institutional challenges (C8–C13); and G3—Resources and capacity challenges (C14–C19). Technical challenges (Group G1) are reported more often in the literature compared to the other groups, shown by a higher number of challenges and more reporting documents. The more frequently reported challenges in this group include “
 <italic class="italic">C1</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Lack of knowledge and understandings about the flood mechanisms in the floodplain</italic> ”; “
 <italic class="italic">C2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Existing flood protection measures create unwanted impacts</italic>”; “
 <italic class="italic">C4</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Research results are not taken up in flood management</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">C7</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Uncertainties in future climate change, sea</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">level rise and socioeconomic development hinder development of flood management plans</italic>”. Various flood management challenges relating to the governance and institutional settings (Group G2) were also reported, resulting in the following main challenges: “
 <italic class="italic">C9</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Limited coordination and collaboration in flood management across provinces and districts</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">C10</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Conflicting interests between different management departments and regions</italic>”. Group G3 consists of challenges relating to resources and capacity for flood management. The commonly reported challenges in this group are “
 <italic class="italic">C14</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Flood management lacks financial resource</italic>” and “
 <italic class="italic">C18</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Lack of data and equipment for flood risk management</italic>”. We further found that flood management challenges in the Mekong Delta tend to relate to each other, shown by relatively high correlation coefficients between individual challenges (see Supplementary Material

The strongest correlating challenges include C5, C9, C11, C15 and C19. These strong correlations suggest that the challenges exhibit intricate interlinkages and that they are often experienced together rather than individually in practice.
