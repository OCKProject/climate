 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> presents an overview of the linkages between challenges and flood management strategies based on calculated recommendation rates by our expert panel. Regarding targeting challenges of individual strategies, the differentiated recommendation rates (i.e. varying circle sizes) clearly indicate that the strategies and their associated solutions are tailored differently to the flood management challenges. In practical terms, this implies that while the strategies are highly suitable to address certain challenges (i.e. higher recommendation rates), they seem to be less applicable to others (i.e. lower recommendation rates). The recommendation patterns further show that individual strategies also target a specific group of flood management challenges. For example, strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S1</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Create an enabling environment</italic> mostly addresses challenges under the “Governance and institution” group. Similarly, strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Enrich and strengthen the flood management portfolio</italic> focuses strongly on “Technical” challenges, especially challenge C2 (i.e. unwanted impacts of existing flood protection measures).
