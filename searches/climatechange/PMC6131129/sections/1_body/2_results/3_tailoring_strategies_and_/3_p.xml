<p id="Par40" class="p">We analysed the second aspect of the strategy-challenge configurations to understand how to combine multiple strategies to address the flood management challenges. The recommendation rates in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> show that a majority of flood management challenges, including the top-three (i.e. C8, C9 and C10) require combining multiple response strategies and solutions. For example, the challenge of weak collaborations between different regions can be addressed through a combination of strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S3</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Forster cross</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">boundary interactions</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">strategy S1</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Creating an enabling environment</italic> and strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Strengthen and diversify the flood management portfolio</italic>. For several challenges (e.g. C2, C9, C10), the recommendation rates per strategies also help to distinguish the primary and complementary strategies. Challenge C2 concerns unwanted impacts of the current flood protection dikes in the Mekong Delta. The recommendation pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) suggests that this challenge is primarily addressed through strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Strengthen and diversify the flood management portfolio,</italic> whereas strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S6</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Innovate and shift management approach</italic> can further complement S2.
