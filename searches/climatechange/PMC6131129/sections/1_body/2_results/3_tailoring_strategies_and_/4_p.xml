<p id="Par41" class="p">Multiple flood management strategies should also be combined to address different challenge groups (i.e. technical; governance and institutional; and resources and capacity groups). In particular, three strategies (i.e. S2, S5 and S6) are recommended for the technical challenges group. The most important challenge in this group (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">C2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Existing flood protection measures create unwanted impacts</italic>) are linked with 
 <italic class="italic">S2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Enrich and strengthen flood management portfolio</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S6</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Innovate and shift approaches</italic>. Similarly, the group of governance and institution challenges mostly require solutions under strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S1</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Create an enabling environment</italic>, strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S2</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Enrich and strengthen flood management portfolio</italic> and strategy 
 <italic class="italic">S3</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Foster cross</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">boundary interactions</italic>. For example, challenge 
 <italic class="italic">C9</italic>—
 <italic class="italic">Limited coordination and collaboration in flood management across provinces and districts</italic> are tailored with “Develop a coordinating board for flood management”, “Promote exchange and learning” and “Improve collaboration between stakeholders”. Lastly, many solutions under the strategies S4 and S5 are regarded as relevant to address the group of resources and capacity challenges. Typical solutions for this challenge group include “Build capacity for flood management staff”, “Improve data sharing” and “Diversify funding sources”.
