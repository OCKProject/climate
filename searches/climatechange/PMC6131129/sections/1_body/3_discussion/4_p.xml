<p id="Par45" class="p">Our findings for the Mekong River Delta about flood-risk management strategies and solutions can be applicable for other river basins in several aspects. First, we found that proper configurations of individual solutions are important for flood-risk management, especially when there are multiple, interconnected challenges ("

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2010</xref>) found that the full flood protection approach based solely on river and coastal embankments was infeasible and raised strong criticisms for the Bangladesh Delta. Secondly, we identified many flood management challenges emanating from the governance and institutional settings, which were also reported in other cases in Nepal (Dixit 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2003</xref>) and Thailand (Lebel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, this study reveals ‘soft’ measures as the oftentimes overlooked room for improvements in conventional flood management portfolios. While several studies advocate for transition from flood prevention towards ‘soft’ flood management approach (Wesselink et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015</xref>; Liao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2016</xref>), concrete solutions identified in this study can contribute to realize such transition.
