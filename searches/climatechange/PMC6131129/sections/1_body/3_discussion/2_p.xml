<p id="Par43" class="p">We identified 19 flood management challenges, with about two-thirds of these challenges considered important by the expert panel. This further confirms that flood risks constitute a major threat to water-related safety in the Mekong delta (MDP

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2016</xref>). While many previous studies (Hoa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2008</xref>; Kubiszewski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2013</xref>; Piman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>) highlighted technical challenges, this study found that many critical challenges arise from the current governance and institutional settings. The strong focus on technical challenges is a logical reflection of the current technology-centric flood management approach. This approach, however, has become insufficient under the changing climate and accelerating socioeconomic developments, as suggested by our survey results, as well as by precious studies, including Käkönen (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2014</xref>). The existing governance and institutional settings have constrained the adoption of both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ flood-risk management measures to transform parts of the current flood-risk management approach in order to effectively deal with future risks . This technical management approach, which is the result of path dependency caused by many past (investment) decisions, has probably created strong preferences over flood management practices being implemented in the Mekong Delta. In addition, the existing governance and institutional settings reinforce vested interests of actors and incentivize them to reinforce the status quo (Bachrach and Baratz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1970</xref>). This makes transformational changes (Kates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2012</xref>) even more challenging, especially when these changes in the flood-risk management system should be fast, large scale and deep at the same time (Termeer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2017</xref>).
