 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>). A recent study suggests that sea-level rise by 2100 could be as much as 1.83 m (6 feet), given that Antarctica could contribute more than 1 m (3.3 feet) of sea-level rise by then (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). People living in coastal areas, where ~20% of people worldwide live, and those residing in small-island nations will suffer the greatest impact of sea-level rise. Some island nations may totally disappear and some coastal areas may become uninhabitable, which may force many people to become internally displaced within their own countries or refugees in neighboring countries or elsewhere. In addition to displacing people from their homes and communities, sea-level rise will damage cropland, create saltwater incursion into river deltas and groundwater aquifers, and cause shortages of food and freshwater. As a result, there will likely be major political, economic, and social disruptions, sometimes associated with violence, as people compete for control of land and other resources.
