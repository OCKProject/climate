They included quantitative research studies that employed the most robust experimental or quasi-experimental designs, limiting their focus to investigations that met “modern standards for measuring causal effects” (p. 43). On the basis of their criteria for including studies in this meta-analysis, they believed that independent climate variables were not likely correlated with other variables that were not observed that might have influenced the conflict variable. They found “strong linkages between climate anomalies and conflict and social instability” (p. 52). Specifically, they demonstrated that in most studies, when temperature is high and precipitation is extremely high or extremely low, both conflict and sociopolitical instability increase. However, they also found that, when average temperature is temperate, anomalously low temperature may decrease social stability. They concluded that “climate’s influence on security persists in both historical and modern periods, is generalizable to populations around the globe, arises from climatic events that are both rapid and gradual, and influences numerous types of conflict that range across all spatial scales” (26, p. 52).
