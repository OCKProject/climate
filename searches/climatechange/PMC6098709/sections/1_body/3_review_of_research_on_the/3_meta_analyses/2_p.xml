 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>) performed a meta-analysis based on 60 longitudinal studies, 30 of which focused on intergroup conflict, 15 of which focused on interpersonal conflict, and 15 of which focused on institutional breakdown and population collapse. Of the 30 studies on intergroup conflict, 7 were global, 11 focused on part or all of sub-Saharan Africa, 3 on Europe, 3 on China, and 6 on other geographic locations. Of these 30 studies, 23 used years as time units, 4 used decades, 2 used months, and 1 used centuries. The authors concluded that deviations from mild temperatures and normal precipitation significantly increased conflict risk, most notably in poorer populations. On the basis of their findings, they estimated that each standard deviation of greater rainfall or warmer temperatures increased intergroup conflict by 14% and, in some geographic locations, by more than 50%. They projected that, with increasing temperatures, there would likely be substantial increases in conflict (

 </sup> as “the state of the air and atmosphere at a particular time and place…with respect to heat or cold, wetness or dryness, calm or storm, clearness or cloudiness.” In contrast, climate is defined
