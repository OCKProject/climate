<p id="P19" class="p">In three studies based on data stretching back 1,000 years, Zhang and colleagues demonstrated the following concerning the relationship between climate change and violence. First, in the preindustrial era in the northern hemisphere, climate change was the major underlying cause of armed conflict and other major humanitarian crises. The authors demonstrated that decreasing temperatures led sequentially to lower agricultural production, price inflation, war, famine, and population decline. They also demonstrated that contemporaneous social mechanisms failed to prevent these crises (
