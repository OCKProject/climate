<p id="P42" class="p">Owing to multiple interconnected and cross-sectoral pathways, the cumulative impact of climate change is much greater than the sum of its impacts on health, agriculture, air quality, water supply, housing, and other societal sectors. In addition, because climate change is a risk multiplier, it increases the risk of collective violence due to already-existing causative factors. Therefore, the role of climate change in causing or contributing to collective violence is greatest in places that are already at high risk of collective violence. For example, within low-income countries, climate change often exacerbates socioeconomic disparities, making the poor poorer and those who are vulnerable more vulnerable. This effect is best illustrated in low-income countries where many people support themselves and their families with subsistence agriculture. As climate change damages cropland and adversely affects livestock production (owing to increased temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea-level rise), farmers suffer from reduced access to food, lost income, and food-price shocks, and they often migrate to urban areas, thereby creating social and political instability and increasing the risk of violence (see sidebar, Climate Change Contributed to the Civil War in Syria).</p>
