Research needs to be done to better understand the complex interaction of factors that turn disputes into violent conflicts and to better identify opportunities and create more effective mechanisms to settle conflicts by nonviolent means. Research challenges include gathering data on local climate conditions on sufficiently large populations so that valid conclusions can be drawn and performing studies with sufficiently long timeframes.
