Improving access to renewable energy from microgrids (small off-grid electricity sources for cooking, illumination, and powering of water pumps, flour grinders, and other devices that are operated by electric motors powered by renewable energy) can reduce reliance on biomass fuels, retard deforestation, improve soil conditions, and increase family incomes.
