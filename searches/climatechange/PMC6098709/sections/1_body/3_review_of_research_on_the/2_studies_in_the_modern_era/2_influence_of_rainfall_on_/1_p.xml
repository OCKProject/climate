<p id="P29" class="p">Some research has demonstrated that a significant decrease in rainfall, associated with drought, leads to increased conflict. Levy and others (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>) discovered that, when there was a significant decrease in rainfall, the probability of high-intensity internal war beginning in the next year was significantly increased. However, they did not find a significant association between deviations in rainfall and low-intensity internal war. In sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2008, Fjelde &amp; von Uexkull (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>) found that major deviations in rainfall as compared with historic norms were associated with an increased probability of communal conflict. They also found that the impact of decreased rainfall on the probability of communal conflict is increased in areas where members of ethnic and political groups who have been politically excluded reside. In Africa between 1997 and 2011, Harari &amp; La Ferrara (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) found that, during the growing seasons of main crops, adverse climate shocks were associated with a substantial and persistent impact on the incidence of conflict at the subnational level, especially violence against civilians. They projected that, under “a midrange emissions scenario,” severe climate shocks in growing seasons would more than double during the next two decades, resulting in a 7% increase in the incidence of conflict (p. 34). Finally, Opiyo and colleagues (
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>), who studied violent conflicts in drought-prone pastoral areas in Kenya, found that while violent conflicts are caused by a complex interaction of political, economic, and sociocultural factors, frequent droughts aggravated competition for scarce natural resources and led to the development of violent conflicts in the study areas.
