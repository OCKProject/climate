 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) found that factors that were not directly related to resource scarcity and the environment, such as corruption within government, were the most likely explanations for violent conflict there. Lastly, after reviewing data concerning climate and civil war in Africa, Buhaug (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>) concluded that variability of climate poorly predicts armed conflict and that, in Africa, civil war is attributable mainly to poor national economies and the exclusion of ethnic and political groups. He acknowledged, however, that much research is based on national data that may mask subnational data on rainfall and conflict.
