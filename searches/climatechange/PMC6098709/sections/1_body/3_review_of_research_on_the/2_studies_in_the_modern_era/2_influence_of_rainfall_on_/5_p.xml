<p id="P33" class="p">Although many studies have found that decreased rainfall, with associated drought, is associated with violence, some studies have demonstrated that increased rainfall can also be associated with violence. Globally between 1979 and 2006, Salehyan &amp; Hendrix (
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>) found that an abundance of water was associated with political violence. They asserted that political violence occurs more often when basic needs of populations are met and when “the tactical environment is more conducive to attacks—conditions that hold when water is more abundant.” In 47 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 1991 and 2007, these same authors demonstrated that rainfall was associated with insurgency and civil war. They also found that extreme deviations in rainfall (especially abundant rainfall) were strongly associated with violence. More broadly, they found a strong association between environmental shocks and unrest (

 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>) found that wetter years were associated with large-scale violence. He stated that this finding was most likely due to large-scale violence not being feasible in periods when there is extreme scarcity, reasoning that reconciliation, cooperation, and peace are goals in pastoralist communities in the presence of drought. In addition, he also found that election years were associated with violence and that major intergroup violence between groups is influenced primarily by “calculation and political gain” as opposed to competition over scarce land and water resources (
