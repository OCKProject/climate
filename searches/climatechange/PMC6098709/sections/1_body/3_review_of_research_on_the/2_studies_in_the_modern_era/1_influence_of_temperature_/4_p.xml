 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>) demonstrated that drought led to decreases in the price of livestock, which fueled conflict. On the basis of their findings, they projected that if by 2100 the average temperature in eastern Africa increased by ~3.2°C (5.8°F) (the median IPCC scenario for this region by 2100), then cattle prices would decrease about 4% and violent conflict would increase by ~58%. They concluded that climate change will worsen security challenges in Somalia and require effective measures to strengthen resilience to drought and conflict, especially in pastoralist communities (
