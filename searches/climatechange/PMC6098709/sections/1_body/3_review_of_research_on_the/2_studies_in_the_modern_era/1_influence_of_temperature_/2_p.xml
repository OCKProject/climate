<p id="P22" class="p">Studying conflict in sub-Saharan Africa between 1981 and 2002, Burke and colleagues found a significant association between warmer temperature and civil war. On the basis of their findings, they projected an approximately 54% increase in armed conflict in Africa by 2030, with an additional 393,000 battle-related deaths, assuming wars in the future are as deadly as recent wars (

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>) asserted that, during the previous 30 years, while temperature increased in most of Africa, the incidence of civil war decreased and the estimated annual number of conflict fatalities for the average civil war in sub-Saharan Africa decreased, from approximately 6,100 to 1,600. He also argued that the association claimed by Burke and colleagues disappeared completely when their initial analysis was broadened to include a more recent time period (

 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>) revised the model they used for their study and developed further results, which confirmed that variations in the occurrence of large wars in the 1980s and 1990s in sub-Saharan Africa could be explained, in part, by temperature change. Burke and colleagues acknowledged that their results do not hold for the 2003â€“2008 period; they believe that international peacekeeping, economic development, and better domestic governance may have mitigated these effects (
