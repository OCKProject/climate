<p id="P21" class="p">Studying conflict in the tropics from 1950 to 2004, Hsiang and colleagues demonstrated that the likelihood of new civil conflicts increased from 3% to 6% during years of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), when much of the land area in the continental tropics becomes considerably warmer and drier, as compared with La Niña years. They also found that, in more temperate latitudes, the impact of ENSO was usually less extreme. They concluded that, since 1950, ENSO may “have had a role” in the development of 21% of civil conflicts (
