<p id="P27" class="p">Hot temperatures have been associated with forms of violence other than collective violence. For example, Nitschke and colleagues (
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>) found that, during heat waves, there was a 13% significant increase in assault-related injuries among people 15–64 years of age. Li and colleagues (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>) found an association of borderline significance with intentional self-harm (suicide and attempted suicide), with a threshold at 27.2°C (81°F). Page and colleagues (
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>) found that, for each 1°C increase in mean temperature above a threshold of 18°C (64.4°F), there was a 3.8% significant increase in suicide.
