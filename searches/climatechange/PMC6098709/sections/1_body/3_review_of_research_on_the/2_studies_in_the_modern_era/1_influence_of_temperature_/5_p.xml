 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>) performed research on temperature and precipitation variability and the impact of these variables on the probability of violence from 1980 to 2012 in sub-Saharan Africa. They found that temperature was significantly associated with violence, but there were inconsistencies in the association between temperature extremes and occurrence of conflict. In addition, they found that location and time of violence were less influenced by temperature and precipitation variability than they were by economic, political, and geographic factors (
