<p id="P18" class="p">Violence has been defined as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation” (

Collective violence, which includes armed conflict, state-sponsored violence (such as torture and genocide), and organized violent crime (such as gang warfare), has been defined as “the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as members of a group…against another group or set of individuals, in order to achieve political, economic or social objectives” (

Although the definition of collective violence applies globally, collective violence and its consequences are manifested differently in different regions and different countries. For example, from 2004 to 2013, state-based conflict occurred mainly in Africa and “Asia and Oceania,” and nonstate conflict occurred mainly in Africa (

As another example, of the 21.3 million refugees worldwide, 41% have come from just 3 war-torn countries: Syria (4.9 million), Afghanistan (2.7 million), and Somalia (1.1 million); and just 6 countries host 7.6 million refugees: Turkey (2.5 million), Pakistan (1.6 million), Lebanon (1.1 million), Iran (979,400), Ethiopia (736,100), and Jordan (664,100) (
