<p id="P5" class="p">The IPCC has projected that heavy precipitation events (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) will likely increase in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation over many land areas in the early part of this century and (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) will likely increase over most of the midlatitude land masses and wet tropical regions in the late part of this century (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Heavy precipitation events are often accompanied by coastal storm surges and flooding. The IPCC has stated that it is “virtually certain” that increases in intense tropical cyclone activity have occurred in the North Atlantic since 1970 and “more likely than not” will also occur in the western North Pacific in the late part of this century (
