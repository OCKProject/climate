<p id="P8" class="p">Heat-related consequences include heat-related disorders, such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and dehydration, as well as complications of chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. Each year in the United States there are, on average, more than 600 deaths that are clinically reported as associated with excessive exposure to natural heat, although the actual number may be much greater because deaths from heat-related disorders are often not reported unless a heat wave is occurring (
