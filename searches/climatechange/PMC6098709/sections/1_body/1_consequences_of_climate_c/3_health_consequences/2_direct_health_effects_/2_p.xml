<p id="P9" class="p">As a result of climate change, respiratory and allergic disorders will increase, owing primarily to higher concentrations of ozone (largely due to vehicular exhaust and warm ambient temperatures), smoke from wildfires, increased production of pollen and longer pollen seasons, and increased exposure to mold (as a result of residential water damage from flooding). In addition, infectious diseases resulting from climate change include vector-borne disease (as a result of wider distribution of disease-carrying vectors and longer transmission seasons), waterborne disease (largely due to sewage contamination of water supplies as a result of floods and to scarcity of water during severe droughts, leading to the use of unsafe water sources), and foodborne disease (because higher temperatures increase growth and persistence of pathogens and because of food contamination from contaminated water).</p>
