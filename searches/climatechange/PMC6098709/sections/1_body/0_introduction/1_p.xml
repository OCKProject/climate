<p id="P2" class="p">Climate change—or, perhaps more accurately, global climate disruption—is profoundly affecting life on earth in many interrelated ways. The health and environmental risks posed by climate change are interlinked with conditions of poverty and socioeconomic inequalities, with population growth and migration, with emerging diseases and hazardous chemicals, and with ecosystem damage and biodiversity loss. This article focuses on the increasing body of evidence concerning the relationships between aspects of climate change and collective violence. It also explores what public health professionals can do to expand the knowledge base concerning these relationships and what can be done to prevent collective violence caused, or contributed to, by climate change.</p>
