 <p id="P70" class="p">Climate change is likely to have contributed to the development of the civil war in Syria, which began in 2011 and has since caused an estimated 400,000 deaths, forced more than 9 million Syrians to flee their homes, and created a major humanitarian crisis. From 2006 through 2009, a severe drought transformed approximately 60% of the land area into desert. Studies estimate that approximately 80% of cattle died. Hundreds of thousands of farmers and their family members—perhaps as many as 1.5 million people—abandoned their farms and moved to cities, which were already burdened with more than 1 million Iraqi refugees. By the end of 2010, Syria’s urban population was 13.8 million, 50% more than it had been in 2002. Most of the farmers were unable to find employment and felt that they were being mistreated by the government of Bashar al-Assad (

 <p id="P71" class="p">Kelley and colleagues (
  <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>) demonstrated that the extreme severity of the drought in Syria was part of a long-term drying trend, which was consistent with models of increases in GHGs (human-induced climate change). They concluded that the drought contributed to political unrest in this country, which has had poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies. They projected continued intensification of heat and drought for the Eastern Mediterranean region (
