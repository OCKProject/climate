 <p id="P68" class="p">Volatility in commodity prices and sudden unpredictable price spikes (sharp increases) seriously threaten food security. Poor people living in urban areas are especially vulnerable to food price shocks because they purchase most of their food (as opposed to growing it). While poor farmers in rural areas may ultimately benefit financially from incremental increases in crop prices, they often do not benefit initially from unexpected dramatic price changes (
