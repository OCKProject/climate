 </xref> Climate change will disproportionally affect small island states, because of their relatively small land area, high population density and dependence on local ecosystems for subsistence. Rising sea levels threaten to make low-lying island nations such as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu uninhabitable. Understandably, Pacific island leaders have called for increases in global average temperatures to be limited to less than 1.5 °C.
