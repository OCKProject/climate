<p class="p">Enhancing potato productivity is important to meet the global food demand of an increasing population. However, potato plant growth and tuber yield is constrained by high temperature, water limitation, soli salinity, and insect and pathogen threats. Climate change will likely further aggravate tuber yield losses by intensifying potato plant’s exposure to these stress conditions. Hence, there is an urgent need to adapt to the new cropping challenges by developing heat, drought, insect and pathogen-tolerant crop cultivars that are appropriately engineered for the changing environment. Improving potato plant adaptability to environmental stresses under increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is one of the most important and challenging targets. This challenge can be approached through the identification of stress-related traits at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels and their deployment in new cultivars. In addition, the development of new knowledge and techniques on “omics-driven” high-throughput approaches is crucial to advance screening procedures for breeding potato cultivars aimed at improving plant adaptability and tuber productivity in response to climate change.
