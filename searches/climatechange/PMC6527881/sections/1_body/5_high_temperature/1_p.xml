<p class="p">As a cool weather crop potato grows well under moderate temperature in temperate regions. Temperature above the optimal is likely to inhibit plant growth and survival and hence causes reductions in tuber yield and productivity (

 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). The susceptibility of potato crops to high temperature, however, largely depends on cultivars (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ahn et al., 2004</xref>). The optimal temperature requirements for above ground plant growth and below ground tuber growth are different, the former perform well in the range of 20–25°C and the later in the range of 15–20°C (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rykaczewska (2015)</xref> tested six potato cultivars to determine whether the temperature sensitivity of potato plant is growth stage dependent and revealed that the earlier high temperature stress occurs, the more negatively it impacts the plant growth and tuber yield. Temperature above 25°C has been found to delay tuberization. It has been predicted that potato yield will decline substantially by 2055 as a consequence of global warming and drought (
