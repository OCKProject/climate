<p class="p">Drought is a main abiotic stress that can strongly perturb plant performance and crop productivity mainly through inhibition of photosynthesis. Drought induced stomata closure, meant to reduce transpiration water loss and conserve plant water status, also restricts CO

This may result in the accumulation of ATP and NADPH, since their rates of generation by photosynthetic electron transport chain do not match with their utilization by Calvin cycle. Consequently, there is an energy imbalance in the chloroplast level leading to oxidative stress and damage of cell components. Thus, in addition to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis, water deficit-sensitive biochemical machineries may also limit rates of photosynthesis during drought stress. However, the degree of contribution of stomatal limitation versus biochemical limitation to photosynthetic inhibition is still ambiguous (
