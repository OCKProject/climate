<p class="p">Another strategy used by potato plant to adapt salt stress is to activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging pathways. Salt stress generates ROS in the form of singlet oxygen, superoxide, peroxides, hydroxyl radical, which are detrimental to normal cell function as they cause oxidative damage to protein, nucleic acids, lipids among others. Scavenging of ROS is, therefore, critical for plants to survive salt stress. To understand the importance of ROS scavenging in potato, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aghaei et al. (2009)</xref> analyzed antioxidant enzyme activities and ion content in tolerant (cv. Kennebec) and sensitive (cv. Concord) cultivars subject to various salinity treatments. They observed a decrease in activity of antioxidant enzymes; ascorbate peroxidise, catalase and glutathione reductase in the shoot of salt sensitive cultivar, Concord, in response to NaCl treatment. In contrast, the activity of all these enzymes were upregulated in salt-tolerant cultivar, Kennebec, following NaCl treatment. This was reflected to higher plant biomass in Kennebec as compared to Concord under salinity stress, suggesting that increased antioxidant enzyme activity makes Kennebec tolerant to salt stress. In a similar experiment, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fidalgo et al. (2004)</xref> reported a significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity but decrease in catalase activity with no change in ascorbate peroxidase activity in Desiree at 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatment relative to control. 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Queirós et al. (2011)</xref> also observed a decrease in catalase activity and no differences in ascorbate peroxidise activity in salt-treated versus control potato plants. Although the total superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities decreased following salt treatment, the amount of ascorbate and reduced glutathione increased in salt treated versus control plants (
