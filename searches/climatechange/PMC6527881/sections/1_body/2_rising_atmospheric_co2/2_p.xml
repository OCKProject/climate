 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>). Most studies revealed that the growth and development of potato plants under high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enhanced tuber yield by stimulating photosynthetic light use efficiency, and improved WUE through closing stomata and preventing transpirational water loss (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In a FACE experiment elevated CO

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Magliulo et al., 2003</xref>). The open top chamber experiment revealed about 40% increase in “Bintje” tuber yield at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> of either 550 or 680 μmol CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> compared to at ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donnelly et al., 2001</xref>). This stimulation was mainly associated with increased average tuber weight with tuber number having minimal effect. Similarly, in both controlled environment and field experiment, potato plants exhibited 30% yield stimulation when grown and developed at elevated CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mackowiak and Wheeler, 1996</xref>). The increase in tuber yield was associated with either enhanced leaf area index (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schapendonk et al., 2000</xref>). A recent growth chamber study revealed an enhancement of WUE by 89 and 147% when grown at 700 and 1000 μmol CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kaminski et al., 2014</xref>). This enhancement was associated with stimulation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation by 62 and 43%, with concomitant inhibition of stomatal conductance by 21 and 43% and leaf transpiration rates by 19 and 40% at 700 and 1000 μmol CO
