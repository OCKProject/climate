 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Katny et al., 2005</xref>). This inhibition of photosynthetic capacity is accounted for by an accumulation of photoassimilates in the source leaves (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Katny et al., 2005</xref>), which may limit P
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> regeneration due to decreased recycling of phosphorylated intermediates (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sage et al., 1989</xref>). Additionally, the feedback inhibition of photosynthesis is associated with down-regulation of the key regulatory photosynthetic gene expression and corresponding enzyme activities, in particular, RuBisCO (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sicher and Bunce, 1999</xref>). The photosynthetic acclimation during growth at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has also been associated with stomatal closure, decrease in leaf chlorophyll content, and decreased RuBisCO activation state in the photosynthesizing source leaves (
