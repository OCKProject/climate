<p class="p">In the past century, intensive crop breeding has been focused on selecting drought resistant cultivars by considering yield, plant phenotype, leaf morphology, osmolyte content and leaf water content as the indicators with little efforts on the rates of either photosynthesis or respiration. Although the majority of the research suggests that enhancing photosynthetic performance under drought strongly improves plant growth, its effect on tuber yield and quality is still not well understood, Thus, future research needs to be focused on understanding the photosynthetic and respiratory regulation of tuber yield and quality during drought stress. Since potato cultivation is expanding to water limited areas and the predicted climate change may further aggravate drought severity, understanding the precise mechanism of drought tolerance at the levels of molecular, biochemical and physiological is critical to improve tuber yield.</p>
