<p class="p">Potato plants have evolved several strategies ranging from physiological and biochemical responses to change in gene expression and metabolic activity to combat drought stress (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These strategies enable plants either to maintain water potential by escaping the drought or develop the adaptation mechanisms to tolerate lower water potential. These strategies, however, depend largely on cultivar, growth stage and drought severity. One of the important strategies used by potato plants to survive drought stress is improvement of WUE through reduction in leaf number, leaf area and stomatal conductance as a means to minimize transpiration water loss and conserve leaf water status (

However, the associated cost will be reduced leaf surface area for photosynthesis, thus negatively impacting carbohydrate synthesis. The leaves become narrower and develop leaf hair to reduce the light absorbance and prevent photooxidative damage. Some studies have suggested an increase in root to plant biomass ratio during drought stress. Potato cultivars exhibiting higher root to shoot ratio owing to extensive and large root architecture have been found to be less susceptible to drought stress as they can increase nutrient and water uptake efficiency (

 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zarzynska et al. (2017)</xref> tested five potato cultivars and reported a correlation between root length and area to tuber yield under drought stress. They concluded that potato cultivars with deeper root length and larger root systems exhibit increased drought tolerance. Acclimation of potato to mild drought stress can reduce yield losses under severe drought stress. Drought acclimation cycles followed by severe drought treatment reduced leaf wilting, induced thicker cuticular layer and more open stomata compared to plants without acclimation treatment (
