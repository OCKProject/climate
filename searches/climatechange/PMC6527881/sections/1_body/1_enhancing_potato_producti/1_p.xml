<p class="p">Since the mid-1950s the increased application of pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation water as well as genetic improvement have mainly contributed to the enhanced yield of major food crops (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Murchie et al., 2009</xref>). The slower yield increase of principal food crops since the last decade suggests that the yield enhancement due to increased use of agricultural inputs and improved cultivation practices has reached a maximum theoretical limit (

 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Consequently, the additional increase in the yield of major crops can only be expected through improving genetic yield potential that is, the crop yield that a plant can achieve per unit ground area under optimum growth conditions in the absence of biotic and abiotic stresses (

 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ort et al., 2014</xref>). The genetic gain in potato, particularly yield, has been low and is in need for improvement (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hirsch et al., 2013</xref>). The maximum potential yield is determined by a number of yield components associated with photosynthesis. They are (i) amount of incident solar radiation (ii) light interception efficiency, by which photosynthetic pigments intercept photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400–700 nm) (iii) photosynthetic efficiency, through which the intercepted light energy is converted to biomass (iv) partitioning efficiency, by which the biomass energy is partitioned into seeds/tubers also known as harvest index (

 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). After 1960’s green revolution, the light interception efficiency and the energy partitioning efficiency have approached the plateau due to release of new cultivars and intensive use of agricultural inputs. Thus, further enhancement in yield potential can only be obtained by improving photosynthetic light conversion efficiency (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ort et al., 2014</xref>). This notion has been supported by recent studies, which revealed that improving photosynthetic efficiency significantly increases wheat and rye grain yield (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kromdijk et al., 2016</xref>) and tobacco seed yield (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dahal and Vanlerberghe, 2018b</xref>). Although photosynthesis is central to convert solar incident energy into biomass and crop yield, improving photosynthetic efficiency has received little research priority in enhancing crop yield (
