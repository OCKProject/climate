<p class="p">Potato tuber is chiefly composed of photoassimilates mainly starch. Hence, an enhancement in tuber yield can be obtained through stimulation of photosynthetic carbon fixation and its translocation to underground stem. 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Slattery and Ort (2015)</xref> have suggested an energy conversion efficiency between 0.028 and 0.041 for eight different C3 plants, with potato as the best with an energy conversion efficiency of 0.041. Since current energy conversion efficiency of potato is less than the maximal theoretical limit expected for C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), there is a great potential to enhance potato tuber yield through improved photosynthetic efficiency. Potato cultivars exhibit a considerable difference in rates of photosynthesis, which can be used effectively in breeding new cultivars with a higher photosynthetic yield potential (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cieply, 1976</xref>). These differences in rates of photosynthesis can be used as a physiological marker for screening potato germplasms for higher tuber yield potential. It should be, however, considered that the canopy level net CO

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frier, 1975</xref>). Several studies suggest that increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> will stimulate photosynthetic yield potential. However, one should also note that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-stimulation of rate of photosynthesis is substantially offset by higher than optimal temperature, drought and soil salinity. Thus, future breeding programs should focus on screening potato cultivars that have potential to maintain higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation rates under abiotic stress associated with global warming and climate change. Following section will discuss how elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, high temperature, drought and soil salinity impact on maximum potential yield with particular focus on potato and photosynthetic efficiency.
