<p class="p">Potato tuber mainly consists of carbohydrates assimilated through photosynthesis. Photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency of potato is only 0.0411 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, there is a great potential to enhance potato tuber yield through improved photosynthetic efficiency. Future research needs to identify and characterize potato cultivars exhibiting a higher rates of photosynthesis, which can be used effectively in breeding new cultivars with a higher yield potential. Moreover, the biotechnological approaches that could improve RuBisCO activity, lower photorespiratory loss of carbon and non-photochemical quenching of absorbed light energy may be remarkable to enhance photosynthetic yield potential (
