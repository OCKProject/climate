<p class="p">The effect of high temperature associated with climate change on potato crop yield is still a major area of research. There is still little information about the growth stage most critical to temperature stress (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Levy and Veilleux, 2007</xref>). The mechanism by which potatoes initially sense the changes in their surrounding temperature and consequently respond to this change at the physiological, biochemical and molecular levels is still not fully understood. Elucidation of such mechanism may offer new insights into the identification of specific characteristics that will be useful in breeding new cultivars aimed at sustaining or even enhancing potato crop productivity and quality in response to climate changes.
