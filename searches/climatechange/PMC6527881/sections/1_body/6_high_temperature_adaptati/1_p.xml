 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bita and Gerats, 2013</xref>). One strategy that plants employ following heat stress is a considerable increase in activity of heat stress transcription factors (

 <italic class="italic">HSFs</italic> are known to involve in governing heat stress response (HSR) and acquired thermotolerance by serving as a molecular chaperones (
