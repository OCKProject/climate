<p class="p">Salinity is a major threat to crop production worldwide affecting over 800 million hectares of land and representing more than 6% of the global land area (

Saline soils are usually developed through irrigation of water contaminated with salts, salt water inundation and lack of precipitation to flush out salts from the soil. The accumulation of Na

Salinity is measured in terms of electrical conductivity and osmotic potential. Climate change is predicted to raise the sea level, which may subsequently inundate agricultural soils with saline water in the coastal regions (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dasgupta et al., 2009</xref>). The expected increase in drought severity and frequency may also contribute to soil salinity through upward movement of the ground water contaminated with salts. Salinity adversely affects plant growth and development through osmotic stress in the plant. Soil containing higher dissolved solutes of salt lowers the soil water potential affecting water balance in the plant-soil continuum. In order for leaves to maintain downhill water gradient, they require to lower the water potential below the soil water potential resulting water deficit in plants. Thus, the effects of salinity is similar to those of drought stress in many aspects discussed in earlier chapter. In addition, the accumulation of ions of Na

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Queirós et al., 2009a</xref>). These ions when present in higher concentrations in the cytosol, hinder enzymatic reactions, protein synthesis and plasma membrane permeability. Salt-induced injury to plant has also been associated with nutrient imbalance and oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Queirós et al., 2009a</xref>). In sensitive species, salinity retards seedling emergence, root growth and leaf water potential leading to desiccation and early senescence. Salinity also inhibits rates of photosynthesis and alter the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Legay et al., 2009</xref>). Plants have evolved several strategies to adapt to salt stress. Three main salinity tolerance strategies in plants have been suggested; (i) ion exclusion from shoot and leaves, (ii) tissue tolerance, and (iii) shoot ion-independent tolerance (

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). Salinity tolerance in plants is accounted for by adjustment at the molecular, biochemical, physiological and morphological levels.
