<p class="p">The global potato production is estimated to be 382 million tons in 2014 ranking first highest produced non-cereal food crop and the fourth highest produced crop worldwide after wheat, corn and rice (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAOSTAT, 2017</xref>). Potato is cultivated in over 100 countries feeding over a billion people worldwide. It is a rich source of carbohydrates and provides other essential nutrients, such as dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, protein and antioxidants (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bach et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, enhancing potato crop productivity can contribute to fulfill the nutritional requirements of the rising population (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Birch et al., 2012</xref>). Potato is mainly grown for its tubers. Synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis in the source leaves, translocation of photosynthetic end product, sucrose, to the stolon and conversion of sucrose to starch in the stolon are key physiological process for potato tuber initiation and growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The effective coordination among these processes determines tuber productivity and quality. During photosynthesis, photosynthetic electron transport chain generates ATP and NADPH, which are then consumed by Calvin cycle to assimilate CO

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rochaix, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foyer et al., 2012</xref>). The photosynthetic end product, sucrose, is then translocated into the underground stem via phloem loading and converted into starch (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Any stresses that have negative effects on these processes may substantially inhibit tuberization and tuber growth resulting in lower tuber yield and quality. Since the potato tuber is chiefly composed of photoassimilates, mainly starch, an increase in tuber yield can be expected through stimulation of photosynthetic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation and translocation of the photosynthetic end product to the underground stem. Major abiotic stresses namely, high temperature, drought, soil salinity and nutrient stresses adversely affect these processes and substantially curtail plant growth, tuberization, tuber bulking, and hence tuber yield and quality (

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang-Pruski and Schofield, 2012</xref>). The magnitude of yield loss due to these stresses, however, depends on the duration, severity and plant growth stage (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Evers et al., 2010</xref>). Early stress is most detrimental to tuberization, bulking and tuber yield as a result of reduced rates of carbon assimilation and decreased partitioning of assimilates to tubers (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Obidiegwu et al., 2015</xref>). It has been predicted that potato yield will decline substantially by 2055 due to global warming and drought (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holden et al., 2003</xref>). In another study 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hijmans (2003)</xref> anticipates that world potato production will decline by 18–32% in the projected period of 2040–2069 as a consequence of biotic and abiotic stresses associated with climate change. Thus, in order to improve potato yield, we need to identify best production practices and develop new potato cultivars that best fit in the predicted climate change. Yet the lack of data on the precise mechanisms of plant resistance to abiotic stress and the subsequent ability to predict future outcomes constitute a major knowledge gap. This review paper first describes processes of enhancing crop yield through improved energy conversion efficiency into biomass and crop yield followed by some important abiotic stresses impacting this efficiency. The main focus will be on how these abiotic factors impact potato growth, development and yield, and possible adaptation strategies to combat these stresses.
