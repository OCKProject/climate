<p class="p">Global climate change poses a major challenge to sustainable crop production. Global climate change has affected weather patterns resulting in extremes of heat, drought, frequent frost and snow fall in high altitudes (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). The sub-optimal growth conditions associated with global warming and climate change negatively impact plant growth, survival and crop yield (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lesk et al., 2016</xref>). Such negative impact on plant performance and crop yield is likely to be aggravated in future because continued greenhouse gas emissions will intensify crop plant’s exposure to abiotic and biotic stresses (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). Climate scientists have projected that the current ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of 380 ppm will double to ca. 700 ppm by the end of the 21st century (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2007</xref>), which is likely to be coupled with a rise in the global air temperature by 0.3 to 4.8°C (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). The predicted increase in the atmospheric temperature may increase the evapo-transpiration water loss causing soil water limitation and agricultural drought (

 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vandegeer et al., 2012</xref>). Climate change is also predicted to increase soil salinity particularly in the coastal regions through sea level rise and salt water intrusion (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dasgupta et al., 2009</xref>). Recent study suggests that the geographical distributions of pest and pathogens, and their interactions with plant hosts, including changes in host susceptibility, will be affected by changing climate (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elad and Pertot, 2014</xref>). Thus, while the anticipated increase in the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> level may enhance yield potential in certain crop species (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deryng et al., 2016</xref>) the yield losses due to high temperature and water deficit may surpass the benefit achieved by any increase in CO

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lobell and Gourdji, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the sub-optimal growth conditions are occurring at a time of predicted 30% increase in the world population by 2050 (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2011</xref>). This has created a global challenge concerning food security, which urges that the yield of major food crops needs to be increased two-fold over the next 50 years to fulfill the nutritional requirements of the increasing population (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Murchie et al., 2009</xref>). The projected increase in food demand is further complicated by decrease in the total area of agricultural land due to desertification and urbanization, and increase in the food grain demand for animal nutrition and biofuel generation (
