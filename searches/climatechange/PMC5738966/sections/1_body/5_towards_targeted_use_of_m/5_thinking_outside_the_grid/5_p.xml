<p id="p0315" class="p">“Thinking outside the gridbox” is a broad term that tries to capture the need to critically assess the use of climate model output and avoid the presumption that analyses should begin and end with gridded output. This is not a matter of further processing or aggregating gridbox data, but rather of recognising the inherent limitations of it and extracting the maximum information content from the data. Approaches used include non-spatial representations of impacts, as is common in many studies (e.g. quantification of incidence of crop failure rates,

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al., 2010</xref>), as opposed to being overly explicit geographically; and use of crop-climate indices (

 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al. (2016)</xref> present an example of this approach, by using i. data on the breeding and dissemination of new crop varieties; ii. crop-climate indices, with uncertainty analysis to identify the time at which a climate change signal emerges from current observed variability (see 
 <xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 6.1</xref>); and iii. ‘traditional’ crop modelling. These methods were used to target crop breeding applications by calculating the spatial and temporal scale of robust crop-climate signals (see 
 <xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 6.1</xref> for a brief description of the results of that study).
