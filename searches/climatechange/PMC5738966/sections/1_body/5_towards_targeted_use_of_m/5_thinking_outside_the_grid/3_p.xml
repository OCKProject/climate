<p id="p0305" class="p">Downscaling is often cited as a method for making crop-climate model output more relevant to stakeholders. However, climate model outputs are not primarily maps, since they do not contain geographic features in the way in which we are accustomed to reading them. Rather, they are information with applicability at spatial scales that depend upon the climate itself, which are usually greater than the domain of that grid cell (
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hewitson and Crane, 1996</xref>). Crop modelling studies either use the grid on which the input climate simulations were generated, or they downscale those data to a more relevant spatial scale. A range of downscaling methods exist, each with its pros and cons (
