<p id="p0300" class="p">Long-standing approaches to crop-climate modelling ask “what is the change in yield due to climate change in this location and how might cropping systems adapt?” We argue here that it is important to ask different and more useful questions of our modelling studies, using a wide range of methods and information sources. This includes recognising the potential value of interpreting climate model data both with and without using a crop model.</p>
