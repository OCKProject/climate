<p id="p0330" class="p">Inter-comparability of studies needs to go beyond the choice and performance of models. Frameworks and assumptions need to be clearly stated. For example, whilst crop-climate ensembles quantify uncertainty in weather data, it is less common to consider uncertainty in soil data – yet it may be a major driver of variation in yield (Folberth et al., 2016) MIPs are well-placed to take a leading role in the development of standardised approaches to presenting limitations and assumptions (
