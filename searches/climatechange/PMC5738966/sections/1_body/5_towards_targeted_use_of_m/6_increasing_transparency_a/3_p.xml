<p id="p0325" class="p">Ruiz-Ramos et al. (this issue) use an 
 <italic class="italic">ex post</italic> plausibility check in ensemble wheat modelling, which usefully goes some way towards increasing robustness. However, comparability across risk assessment is only possible when some common methods or protocols are used (see e.g. Liu et al., 2016). Systematic assessments of the response of models to carbon dioxide, temperature, water and nitrogen have been suggested as a way to clearly understand and document model performance (
