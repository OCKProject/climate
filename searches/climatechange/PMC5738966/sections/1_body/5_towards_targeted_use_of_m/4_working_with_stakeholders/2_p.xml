 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>). This contrasts with the more traditional framing that asks “what will happen at a given time in the future?” Given the large uncertainties that exist, the result of these traditional assessments can often lack utility (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al., 2007</xref>). The more recent focus on timing of risks means that uncertainty is expressed using time intervals, rather than ranges of temperature or crop yield. As a result, these new methods can answer the question “for a given important change in climate, or subsequent impact, when are changes likely to be seen?” By comparing the pace of climate change with the pace of autonomous adaptation, these new methods are generating information on the timing of risks to food production systems (
