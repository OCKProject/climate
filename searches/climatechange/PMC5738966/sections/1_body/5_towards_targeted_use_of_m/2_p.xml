<p id="p0270" class="p">Ongoing work to improve crop models their use in ensembles is clearly important. However, we argue that innovative approaches to impact and risk assessments will also be needed to address the challenges faced by crop-climate modelling. The Paris Agreement has brought into sharp focus the need to address adaptation and mitigation jointly (see 
 <xref rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref>). It has reignited scientific interest in sub-two degree global mean temperature targets and prompted a need for risk assessments that can differentiate between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees of global warming. Detecting systematic differences in crop yields at 1.5 vs 2.0 degrees of warming is currently difficult because the range of model results stemming from methodological choices and spatial variability is large (
