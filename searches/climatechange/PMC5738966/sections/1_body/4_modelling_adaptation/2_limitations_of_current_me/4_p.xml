<p id="p0235" class="p">Even if the full range of adaptation options could be modelled, significant problems in quantifying adaptation benefits remain. It has been hypothesised that relative yield changes provide essentially unbiased estimates of future climate impacts that can then be applied to any technological pathway (

 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Springmann et al., 2016</xref>). However, any changes to agronomic management that neglect the evolution of a system under a given socio-economic pathway are unlikely to reflect the true response of the system, since they will neglect the interactions between adaptation and technological change. Similarly, crop production systems that will evolve due to technological progress and altered resource access will likely respond differently to climate change than the current systems that are typically represented in the models (Glotter and Elliott 2016). Improvement is therefore needed in the way adaptation is calculated and in the assumptions on future technologies, e.g. by employing scenarios.
