<p id="p0230" class="p">Notably, little attention has been paid to changes in farm composition, including crop diversification and intercropping, which are typical of smallholding systems across the tropics (

 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weindl et al., 2015</xref>). Modelled adaptations also ignore interactions within the system, e.g. changes in soil organic matter contents in mixed crop-livestock systems (
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thornton and Herrero, 2015</xref>). Modelling studies also fail to represent farmers as agents who are continuously making decisions about the objectives or management of the system in the context of interacting biophysical and socio-economic drivers (
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quinn et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Below et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, framing of adaptation has skewed evidence towards a few practices and systems that can be simulated with confidence, rather than covering what is relevant in specific socio-economic or environmental contexts.
