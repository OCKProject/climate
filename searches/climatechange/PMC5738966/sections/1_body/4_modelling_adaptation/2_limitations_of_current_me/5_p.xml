<p id="p0240" class="p">Modelling studies tend to compare a future with adaptation against a historical baseline, instead of comparing a climate change development pathway with its corresponding non-climate change counterfactual (

 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ewert et al., 2005</xref>), fail to account for the technological development (often agricultural intensification) that occurs regardless of adaptation (
