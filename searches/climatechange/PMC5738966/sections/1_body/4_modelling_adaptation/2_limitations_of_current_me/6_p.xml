<p id="p0245" class="p">A second point for improvement regarding how adaptation benefits are quantified relates to the comparative advantage of an adaptation option under a future climate with respect to the implementation of the same option under the current climate conditions. 
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lobell (2014)</xref> argues that by comparing a non-adapted historical period with an adapted future period (i.e. the difference between point B3 and B2 in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), studies tend to wrongly label certain options as adaptation, and to over-estimate the net benefit of adaptation. Future adaptation should be the result of computing the total advantage of adaptation after factoring its impact on the historical period, and its interactions with prescribed or expected technological change. Towards that aim, the crop modelling community should take advantage of recent efforts to develop scenarios of projected technological change (Representative Agricultural Pathways; Valdivia et al., 2015) linked to global change scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways, SSPs; Kriegler et al., 2012) under which impacts and adaptation studies can be conducted (
