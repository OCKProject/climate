<p id="p0250" class="p">Current good practice in adaptation studies involves inclusion of autonomous adaptation, since this avoids over-estimation of impacts. Less common, but equally important, is comparison of the effect of any future adaptations to their historical counterparts. As outlined above, adaptation tends to be over-estimated when comparing a non-adapted historical period with an adapted future period. Future directions for modelling adaptation include:

   <p id="p0255" class="p">New methods are needed in order to permit a broader range of adaptations options to be assessed. Model limitations currently preclude a comprehensive assessment of adaptation, skewing evidence towards a few practices that can be simulated with confidence, rather than covering what is really relevant in specific socio-economic or environmental contexts. Generally, the absence of explicitly representing management as a response to variable conditions (e.g. Hutchings et al. 2012, 
    <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Waha et al., 2012</xref>, van Bussel et al. 2015) in future projections make simulations of adaptation difficult. In addition, Beveridge et al. (submitted) present some promising ways of making crop modelling adaptation studies both more locally relevant and climate-informed.

More generally, research needs to address the lack of consensus on the nature and magnitude of essential processes to be captured in crop models and assess the variation in essential processes with environmental conditions (Fronzek et al., this issue, provide a good example).
