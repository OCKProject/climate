Where quantitative information on interactions was not available, those relationships were assessed using existing literature. Studies that focus on interactions often fill key knowledge gaps. Guzman et al. (this issue) provide an exemplar study of interactions between crop cultivation, irrigation and groundwater. Elliott et al. (this issue) provide an exemplar study of economic impacts by assessing the insured and uninsured crop losses resulting from drought.
