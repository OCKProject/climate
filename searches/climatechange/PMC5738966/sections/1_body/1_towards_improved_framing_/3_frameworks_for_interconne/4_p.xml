 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ewert et al., 2015</xref>). Further, IAMs may not be the best tool to assess the range of trade-offs and synergies that are important to food systems. The complexity of the inter-related set of climate change and food security risks and responses has led to them being labelled a “wicked problem” requiring a range of approaches (
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vermeulen et al., 2013</xref>). Food security targets are not solely a matter of increasing yield, but also of improving food access, quality and diversity. There may be direct yield trade-offs involved in actions and activities that contribute towards food security (

The integration of local knowledge and the input of social scientists within interdisciplinary modelling research can contribute to the identification and outlining of realistic scenarios of socio-technical change, crop-climate indices, or of model output priorities (i.e. not solely yield
