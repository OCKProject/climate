<p id="p0065" class="p">Risk and uncertainty are concepts that apply where the range of future possibilities is largely known (
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stirling, 2010</xref>). The difference between them lies in whether or not probabilities can be calculated (
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wynne, 1992</xref>). This distinction is often a matter of (expert) opinion rather than provable fact, so that the same crop-climate ensemble can be presented as an assessment of risk or as an assessment of impacts expressed using uncertainty ranges. True assessment of risk implies a knowledge of the consequences of an event, since risk is the product of two factors: the probability that an adverse event will occur and the consequences of that adverse event (
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones, 2001</xref>). For simplicity, however, and following the conventional use of the term “risk” in much of the crop modelling literature, we do not distinguish here between likelihood and risk. Clearly any contribution to the assessing likelihood can be a component of a risk assessment.
