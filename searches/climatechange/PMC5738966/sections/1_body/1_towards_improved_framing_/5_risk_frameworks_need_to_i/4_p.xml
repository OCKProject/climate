The “Simulated events” oval presents the model's attempt to capture exactly the underlying distribution of probabilities – i.e. the “All possible” area, usually through simulating multiple climate and socio-economic scenarios, bias correction of climate model output, crop model calibration, model ensembles and expert interpretation.</p>
