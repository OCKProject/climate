<p id="p0085" class="p">Much of the current focus on assessing the risks of climate change is focused on the stringent 1.5–2 °C limit on global warming agreed at the international climate negotiations in Paris in 2015 (COP21). In order to be consistent with a 2 °C target, emissions across all sectors need to decrease by over 80% by 2050 (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Edenhofer et al., 2012</xref>), with even greater reductions required for a 1.5 °C target. The agriculture, forestry and other land use sector is responsible for 24% of all human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Smith et al., 2014), so is a critical sector for delivering the Paris Agreement. More than even before, it is clear that agricultural systems require changes that address both adaptation and mitigation.
