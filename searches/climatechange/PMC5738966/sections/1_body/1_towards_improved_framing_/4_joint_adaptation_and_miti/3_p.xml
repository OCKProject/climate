 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lipper et al., 2014</xref>) seek to address the challenge of joint adaptation and mitigation challenge. Climate-smart agriculture targets the simultaneous achievement of increasing agricultural production, adapting to climatic change, and mitigating this change through reduced agriculture-related emissions. Understanding and addressing the trade-offs and synergies between these objectives is therefore a research priority for the climate-crop modelling community (
