<p id="p0095" class="p">How might the crop-climate modelling community develop joint adaptation and mitigation frameworks? One approach would be to calculate, or at least estimate, the emissions associated with modelled adaptation options. Tian et al. (this issue) exemplify this approach by quantifying the non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions associated with different paddy rice management strategies and examining yield-emissions trade-offs. Composite measures, such as yield emission efficiency, might also be used to assess how climate-smart specific adaptation options are. A set of recent studies exemplify different existing frameworks for the joint assessment of adaptation, productivity and mitigation outcomes for different types of agricultural interventions, technologies and practices (e.g. Shirsath et al., 2017; Shikuku et al., 2017; Notenbaert et al., 2017).
