A more complex combination of the two approaches is recommended in 
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lutz et al. (2016)</xref>: model selection follows a three step protocol: first, splitting the envelope of projections into four portions based upon a combination of temperature and rainfall and selecting one model from each portion (for example one model from the cold and dry portion); second, sampling of extremes; and finally filtering the remaining models based on skill in representing the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation.
