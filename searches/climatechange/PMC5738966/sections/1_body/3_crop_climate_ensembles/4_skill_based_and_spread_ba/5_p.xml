 <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wallach et al. (2016)</xref> provide a valuable discussion of model selection approaches and identify a broad range of lessons for crop modellers based on methods in ensemble climate modelling. Objective criteria for model selection and weighting of ensemble members are amongst the suggestions made in that paper for improving ensemble crop modelling.
