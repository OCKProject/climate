 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, purely spread-based approaches may generate unrealistic simulations, simply because of the lack of focus on underlying model skill and evaluation. Purely skill-based approaches, on the other hand, may tend to underestimate the full range of future realisations.
