<p id="p0195" class="p">Two categories of selection criteria for ensemble members can be identified: i. skill-based approaches, whereby appropriate model(s) are chosen for a targeted study, and ii: spread-based approaches, which focus on capturing the underlying distribution of possible futures using ensembles. 
 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McSweeney and Jones (2016)</xref> offer the fraction of the full range of future projections captured by a subset as a useful spread-based climate model selection metric. Ruiz- Ramos et al. (this issue), take a spread-based approach and use

In contrast, Ruane et al., (2015) took a skill-based approach by justifying the selection of climate models using four criteria: spatial resolution, degree of evaluation, length of CMIP involvement, and skill in simulating monsoons.
