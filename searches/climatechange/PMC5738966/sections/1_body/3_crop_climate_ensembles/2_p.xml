<p id="p0170" class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, crop-climate ensembles involve both a prior modelling framework (
 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2</xref>) and the running of crop models (introduced in 
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 3</xref>). We focus here on the overarching issues and approaches associated with forming a crop-climate ensemble, including choice of crop and climate models (
 <xref rid="s0055" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.1</xref>), decisions on when and how to assess skill (
 <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.2</xref>), and dealing with any scale-dependency of model choice and ensemble member selection (
 <xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.3</xref>). The supplementary information presents more detail on these issues, as well as the full list of our criteria for application of crop modelling to impacts, adaptation and risk assessment.
