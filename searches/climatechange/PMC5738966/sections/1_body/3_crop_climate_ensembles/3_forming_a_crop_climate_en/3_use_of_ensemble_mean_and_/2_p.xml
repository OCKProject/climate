<p id="p0185" class="p">Ensemble mean or medians can serve as a best-estimate for the impact of climate change. Recent MIPs in crop modelling also find that the median compares better to reference data than most or even any individual model (

This result is in line with what the climate modelling community found in their model intercomparison work, which showed that the superior performance of model ensembles is a result not only of error compensation, but also greater consistency (
