<p id="p0190" class="p">More challenging than the use of ensemble averages is the use of ensemble spread. Especially challenging, and important for risk assessments, are extreme events. Long time series of simulations are needed in order to obtain any statistical significance. Gobin et al. (this issue) address this problem by using crop models with statistical distribution fitting of extremes to assess the impact of multiple adverse weather conditions.</p>
