<p id="p0180" class="p">Justification for use of a particular crop model in an ensemble can come entirely from a-priori reasoning â€“ i.e. demonstration that the model is fit for purpose, as outlined in 
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 3</xref>. However, in the context of an ensemble a second criterion presents itself: to what extent will that model contribute to the correct capturing of the underlying distribution of probabilities (as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and outlined in 
 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2</xref>)? Whilst all ensembles are to some extent ensembles of opportunity, they should not be entirely ad hoc. Rather, ensembles should be formed from a well-justified set of models and input data (see 
 <xref rid="s0020" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref> of the supplementary information). As part of this, usually any climate model data used as input will be bias-corrected (see 
 <xref rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref> of the supplementary information).
