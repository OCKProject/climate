<p id="p0175" class="p">The first task in implementing a risk assessment framework is to choose crop and climate models to work with. Climate model ensembles are usually chosen by the impacts community based on availability and so are to a large extent ensemble of opportunity. Similarly, crop modelling groups may have in-house crop models that they favour, often for good reasons such as confidence in their sound use of the model. However, explicit justification of model choice is often missing:
