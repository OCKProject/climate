<p id="p0220" class="p">Skill-based crop model selection is likely to be particularly important and possibly much easier at smaller spatial scales, where the specifics of the agroecological system being studied become increasingly important (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al., 2014a</xref>). Models often perform better in some regions than in others. This may be simply because of variation in the strength of relationships between yield and climate (see e.g.

 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watson and Challinor, 2013</xref>). However, model structure and complexity, and data and calibration issues, are also likely to play a role. The precise cause of variation in skill is difficult, if not impossible, to determine. At larger spatial scales, it is often more difficult to assess model skill, owing to scarce and uncertain reference data and aggregation issues (
