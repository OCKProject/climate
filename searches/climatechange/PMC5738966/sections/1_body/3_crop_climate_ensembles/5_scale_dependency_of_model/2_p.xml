<p id="p0215" class="p">Choice of parameterisations (and by extension, models) that are appropriate for the spatial scale of a study is critical (see 
 <xref rid="s0015" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.1</xref> of the supplementary information), since measured and modelled responses to the atmosphere can differ across scale (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor and Wheeler, 2008</xref>). However, in more than half of studies, models are applied at scales other than those for which they were originally designed (

 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhao et al. (2015)</xref> studied the effect of using aggregated, low-resolution climate or soil input in field-scale models applied at regional scales. The extent to which model output is biased by aggregation depends upon the crop model, environmental conditions and spatial variability of weather and soil (
