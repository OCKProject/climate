<p id="p0130" class="p">Here we present an abbreviated summary of good practice in the running of individual crop models. Each of the areas is described in more detail in the supplementary information, which describes good practice in selection of input data, model calibration and documentation of models and simulations (

 <xref rid="s0050" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4</xref>). The supplementary information also presents the full list of our criteria for application of crop modelling to impacts, adaptation and risk assessment.

   <p id="p0135" class="p">The crop model used, and the processes simulated, should be of appropriate complexity given the evidence from available data and the spatial scale of the simulations (
    <xref rid="s0055" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.1</xref>). This helps to avoid overtuning during the calibration process, especially if a broad array of observed data are used (e.g. yield, LAI) across a broad range of observed values. Different models were developed to address different questions. High complexity is warranted where yield-determining processes are demonstrably complex. Field scale models are often used at spatial scales greater than those at which they were developed for, implying challenges to aggregation and parameterization (see 
    <xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.3</xref>).

   <p id="p0140" class="p">The model(s) used should be evaluated using historical observed data. A broad range of data (not just yields) over a broad range of environments should be sought and used in evaluating crop models, and error checking of the data is important. Attention to interannual variability is particularly important (see e.g. Hoffmann et al., this issue, and
