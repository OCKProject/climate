<p id="p0160" class="p">Particularly sensitive and/or high frequency processes are another area needing improvement, since they can be especially difficult to simulate. Sensitivity studies from the AgMIP-wheat and AgMIP-rice pilot showed that uncertainty in simulated yield increased with increasing temperatures (

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Asseng et al., 2014</xref>). For both crops the large spread between models could be partly attributed to how phenology was simulated, i.e. the choice of cardinal temperatures, the choice of thermal time accumulation function and, for wheat, the inclusion of accelerated leaf senescence with high temperatures (

 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bassu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the increased uncertainty between models was due to how models dealt with an increased frequency of high-temperature events around and after anthesis and its simulated impact on crop growth.
