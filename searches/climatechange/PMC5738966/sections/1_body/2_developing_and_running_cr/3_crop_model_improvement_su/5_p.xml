<p id="p0165" class="p">A third area for crop model improvement is the potential need to account for microclimate, which requires simulations of canopy temperature. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of microclimate when predicting heat sterility in rice (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Julia and Dingkuhn, 2013</xref>). For wheat, canopy microclimate studies indicate that temperatures can be several degrees warmer or cooler depending on whether evaporative cooling is present (Kumar and Tripathi, 1991; 
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Asseng et al., 2011</xref>). However, recognition of importance does not necessarily transfer into increased model skill. A study comparing nine wheat models that use three different approaches to simulate canopy temperature found only minor improvements when simulated canopy temperature was used for heat stress effects and no improvements when canopy temperature was additionally used for various other processes (
