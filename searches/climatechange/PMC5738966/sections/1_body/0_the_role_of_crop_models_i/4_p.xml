<p id="p0055" class="p">Integrated assessment of risks from climate change is a relatively recent focus for crop modelling. 
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ewert et al. (2015)</xref> have set out a valuable review and outlook for risk assessment using crop models as part of integrated assessment models. Here, we examine the use of crop models for risk assessment outside of this emerging field. We draw on author experience in both MIPs and CCRA2017. Our analysis is also based on a list of criteria for application of crop modelling to impacts, adaptation and risk assessment; and on a list of identified research priorities for the crop-climate modelling research community. These lists, which can be found in 
 <xref rid="s0005" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 1</xref> of the supplementary information, were developed first amongst the authors and then distributed more widely amongst all authors of this special issue, to ensure feedback and consensus. The manuscript reviews were also used to refine the lists.
