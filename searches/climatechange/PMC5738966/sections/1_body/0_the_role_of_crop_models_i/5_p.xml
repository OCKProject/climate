 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2</xref>); the development and running of crop models (
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 3</xref>); the methods used to form crop-climate ensembles (
 <xref rid="s0050" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4</xref>); and the methods used to assess adaptation (
 <xref rid="s0080" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 5</xref>). Good practice in all of these areas underpins accurate risk assessment. We conclude with a forward-looking assessment of how crop models might be better used to improve risk assessments (
