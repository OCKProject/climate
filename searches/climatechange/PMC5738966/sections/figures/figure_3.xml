  <p class="p">Schematic representation of risk assessment. The large circle (a + b + c + d) shows all the possible realisations of a variable of interest (e.g. crop yield, food prices, mycotoxin contamination). Of this full set a smaller circle (b + c) shows those realisations that are judged to present a risk. Of these adverse events, only area (c) is captured by the simulations. Of the remainder of the possibilities, only area (d) is captured by the simulations. Additionally, area (e) shows the set of unrealistic simulations.</p>
