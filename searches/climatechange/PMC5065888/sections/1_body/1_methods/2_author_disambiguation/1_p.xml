<p class="p">The method of author disambiguation can have a big influence on network analysis results (Klosik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>). Here, an un-restrictive method of disambiguation was used; authors whose surname and first name or surname and all initials were the same were assumed to be the same person and their records merged. This level of author disambiguation has been suggested to result in around 5Â % error rate (Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2001</xref>). The database was further simplified by removing authors who only appear in the whole database once, as these are likely to be transitory in the particular research field.
