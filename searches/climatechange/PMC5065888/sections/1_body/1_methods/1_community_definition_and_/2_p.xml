<p class="p">Specific search terms were selected, to cover each theme in the knowledge hub (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The term “model” was not included, as this search proved too restrictive and missed many publications by MACSUR members. Only articles for which at least one author had a European affiliation address were selected for inclusion in the analysis. Results from the three searches were combined in a single database, and duplicate papers removed before further analysis. The analyses described below were carried out for two groups; (1) using all identified papers (‘whole community’ analyses) and, (2) using only those papers including authorship by members of MACSUR (see details below).
