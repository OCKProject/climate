<p class="p">In order to identify the community of researchers collaborating in subject areas related to MACSUR, data on co-authorship was extracted from research articles published in journals indexed by the Web of Science (WoS) database, limited to papers published in the period 2008–2012 (before the establishment of MACSUR) and 2012–2014 (during the active period of MACSUR). Although Web of Science is a comprehensive database, and the search generated a very large sample, there are some limitations to relying on this resource alone. Web of Science has a clear bias towards English language journals, with local or domestic journals and journals in other languages under-represented (Hoekman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, the MACSUR project operates at the level of international collaboration across Europe, the outputs from which are more likely to appear in international than local journals, and as a result the searches conducted are considered sufficient. Web of Science is also biased towards natural science journals, which may have meant that our search missed some potentially relevant economics journals. However, journals relating to agricultural economics, which are most likely to be relevant for this community, are well represented within this database.
