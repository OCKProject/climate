 <italic class="italic">Author centrality</italic> includes measures of how well connected an author is within the network. The number of co-authors an individual has during the period under analysis is recorded as 
 <italic class="italic">degree centrality</italic>; a count of the number of direct links from a given node (Freeman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1979</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Betweenness centrality</italic> is a measure of how frequently a given node appears along the shortest paths between all other pairs of nodes in the network. A high betweenness centrality indicates an author with the potential to broker and control the flow of information between other nodes in the network (Freeman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1979</xref>).
