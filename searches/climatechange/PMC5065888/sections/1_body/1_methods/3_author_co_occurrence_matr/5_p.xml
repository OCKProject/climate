<p class="p">
 <italic class="italic">Network clustering coefficient</italic> measures the proportion of possible links which are actually realised in the network and so is a measure of the extent to which authors in the network tend to group together (Albert and Barabási 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2002</xref>; Cainelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014</xref>). The value ranges from 0 (i.e. neighbours of any author are not connected to another neighbour of the same author) to 1 (i.e. an author’s neighbours are also neighbours of each other).
