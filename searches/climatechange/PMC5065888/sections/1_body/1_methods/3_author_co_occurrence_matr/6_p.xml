 <italic class="italic">Network modularity</italic> is a measure of community divisions within the network. Here, a random walk optimization method was used to detect communities within the network. Modularity is then defined as the fraction of co-authorship links within communities minus the expected value of that fraction if the edges are randomized. A high modularity score suggests clear community divisions within the network, with the majority of co-authorships within communities and few co-authorships between communities within the network (Newman
