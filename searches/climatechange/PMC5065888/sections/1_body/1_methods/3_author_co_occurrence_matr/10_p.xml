<p class="p">All analyses were conducted in 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> version 2.14.1. Network parameters were calculated using package 
 <italic class="italic">iGraph</italic> (Csardi and Nepusz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2006</xref>). Modularity and largest components were identified using a random-walk based algorithm (“walktrap community”). Network parameters were compared with a random network with the same number of authors and co-authorship links using the Erdös-Renyi model algorithm in 
 <italic class="italic">iGraph</italic>. Bootstrapped (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 1000) 95 % confidence intervals for the random model estimates were created, and observed network parameters considered significant if outside this interval. Degree and betweenness centralities of authors were analysed with a two-way ANOVA with MACSUR membership and time as independent variables.
