 <italic class="italic">Network diameter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">mean distance</italic>, are measured as the longest possible path and mean shortest path length between two authors (Albert and Barab√°si 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2002</xref>). Mean distance is expected to decrease as the network grows, with a lower network diameter being indicative of a more tight knit community with a greater number of co-authors within the same number of edges (Bettencourt et al.
