<p class="p">Despite the described advantages of international and interdisciplinary collaboration, building such groups is not a trivial matter. Although it is well established that there is a significant correlation between productivity and collaboration (Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2005</xref>), scientists have been shown to preferentially continue existing collaborations rather than forming new links (Abbasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2012</xref>). A range of barriers to inter-disciplinary collaboration have been identified, including reward systems aligned to work within disciplines, perceived trade-offs between inter-disciplinary collaboration and career advancement through specialisation, academic prejudice against inter-disciplinary research and differences between disciplinary norms, practices and language (Siedlok and Hibbert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>). A lack of high quality inter-disciplinary publication platforms may also hinder inter-disciplinary progress in some fields (Brandt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>), although several well respected interdisciplinary journals are now established in the areas of climate change, environment and agriculture. These factors may help to explain why external incentives for collaboration are only weakly correlated with collaboration frequency (Hara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>).
