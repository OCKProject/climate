<p class="p">The European Union has played an important role in promoting international scientific collaboration and integration in science and technology through its funding frameworks (Glänzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1999</xref>). Within some research fields, a high level of international collaboration has been established among EU states for more than 20 years (Glänzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1999</xref>) and continues to grow (Hoekman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>). Europe is a heterogeneous region in terms of infrastructure, scientific expertise and historical trajectories, creating potential for co-learning across a number of dimensions. At the same time, geographical and language barriers and an unequal distribution of funding and resources have been factors in determining patterns of collaboration across the region. These challenges remain, although a gradual convergence toward a more integrated European science community appears to be reducing difficulties relating to co-publication across national borders (Hoekman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>).
