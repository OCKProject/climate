<p class="p">Informal communication appears to be an important aspect in building partnerships; the desire for more social interactions and intellectual stimulation have been identified as motivations for collaboration (van Rijnsoever and Hessels 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2011</xref>) with Siedlok and Hibbert (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>) highlighting both the pull of interdisciplinary novelty and the push of disciplinary limitations as drivers to work across disciplines. Consistent with these ideas of socially-motivated interaction, collaboration appears to be more likely when potential collaborators are closer either geographically (Hoekman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>; Katz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1994</xref>; Luukkonen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">1992</xref>) or socially (Katz and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1997</xref>). Ensuring a good match of interests and complementarity in skills and personal traits between potential co-workers, are reported as the most important factors determining the level of collaboration between scientists (Hara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>). The challenge is becoming aware of, and getting to know, potential collaborators. In some research areas, bringing together scientists in a networking activity such as a large conference, has been shown to increase the cohesion and connectedness of the research community (Tomassini and Luthi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2007</xref>). Knowledge hubs and other networking instruments may serve a similar function, with the engagement of partners in networking activities facilitating and driving wider and deeper collaborations between community members.
