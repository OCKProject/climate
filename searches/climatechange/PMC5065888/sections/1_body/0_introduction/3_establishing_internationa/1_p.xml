<p class="p">The scientific community has seen a steady increase in international collaboration over the past century (Adams

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sonnenwald 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2007</xref>). International collaboration has been shown to enhance the impact of research by increasing the likelihood of publication and increasing the visibility of published work (Katz and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1997</xref>; Uddin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2013</xref>) with internationally co-authored papers having a higher citation rate (Adams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gl√§nzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1999</xref>) or higher quality than those produced by colleagues within nations (Barjak and Robinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2007</xref>). In addition, collaborations between researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise can be particularly beneficial for the generation of novel insights and discoveries (Katz and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1997</xref>; Siedlok and Hibbert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is of particular importance, given the recognition that novel, innovative solutions are required in addition to incremental changes in order to tackle current challenges facing agricultural systems (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>).
