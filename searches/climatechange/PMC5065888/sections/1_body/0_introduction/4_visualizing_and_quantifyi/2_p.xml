<p class="p">Previous analyses of co-authorship networks have found big differences between research fields in terms of their network structure and connectedness, suggesting differences in sociological or organizational collaboration patterns (Belter and Seidel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>; Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2004</xref>), though it is unclear what those differences are or why they occur (Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2004</xref>). Communities of collaborators can be understood as cohesive and well-connected when the majority of authors are connected to each other either directly or indirectly, and the average distance between authors is short (Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2004</xref>). Such communities can be seen as “small world” networks, centralized around a few well-connected authors (Abbasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>) who have the potential to act as brokers of information between collaborators. Most paths through the network connecting one author to another go through these well-connected authors (Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2004</xref>). In contrast, a community with little evidence of interdisciplinary collaboration produces a highly modular or disconnected network separated into small cliques, with little sharing of information between them.
