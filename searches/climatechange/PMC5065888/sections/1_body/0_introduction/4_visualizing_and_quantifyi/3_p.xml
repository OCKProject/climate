<p class="p">Much previous work has focused on describing community networks within well-defined disciplinary fields (e.g. mathematics: Brunson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2013</xref>; Industrial Ecology: Kim and Perez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>). Describing co-authorship networks for interdisciplinary fields is more challenging than applying the approach within disciplines, as the boundaries of the focus community are not so clear. This paper attempts to describe the community of scientists represented by the inter-disciplinary knowledge hub MACSUR. The aim of the analysis was to investigate how well integrated the MACSUR community was before the establishment of the knowledge hub, and whether any improvement in community cohesion or levels of collaboration could be detected during its active period. In addition to overall community network dynamics, the position of MACSUR members within the community of Climate Change and Agriculture researchers, and whether that position changed as a consequence of participation in the Knowledge Hub, was also investigated.
