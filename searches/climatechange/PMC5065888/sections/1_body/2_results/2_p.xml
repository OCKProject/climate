<p class="p">The whole community network structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) was large and diverse, showing a small increase in cohesiveness by the end of the study period. This appearance was reflected in a small decrease in clustering coefficient and modularity, a small decrease in mean distance, and a small increase in the largest component as a proportion of the whole network (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The network also showed a growing densification over the study period (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 1.58). However, the growth of the largest component was highly correlated with the growth in the total number of authors in the network (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.99, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) suggesting that these changes in network structure were not indicative of a significant change in community dynamics but rather a consequence of increasing community size.
