<p class="p"> The network made up only of MACSUR members, unlike the whole network, showed a clear increase in cohesion during the period studied (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The largest component made up an ever increasing proportion of the network (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), growing more rapidly than the number of authors in the network, with the two only weakly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.68, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05). Modularity also decreased considerably during the study period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) and network densification was far greater than that for the whole network (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 3.42), further suggesting a considerable increase in community cohesion. Mean distance remained relatively low and unchanged during the study period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) suggesting that, from the start, the community was already more closely knit than expected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
