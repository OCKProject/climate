<p class="p">MACSUR members appeared to be better connected than other authors in the whole community network, with a significantly higher degree centrality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and higher betweenness centrality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) throughout the study period. Degree centrality of non-members remained stable, but for MACSUR members it increased rapidly during the active phase of the knowledge hub (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Betweenness centrality increased more gradually throughout the period of study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
