<p class="p">The number of papers and authors identified as part of this interdisciplinary research field continued to grow throughout the study period.

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Centrality of the network remained low throughout the study period, though significantly higher than would be expected in a random network (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
