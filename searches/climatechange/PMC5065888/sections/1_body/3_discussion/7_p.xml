<p class="p">Fostering interdisciplinary collaborations is clearly challenging, considering the diverse commitments of the potential participants. Communication within such collaborations require a degree of translation (Sundberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2007</xref>) as all actors in the partnership do not necessarily share the same vocabulary. This becomes an increasingly important aspect when collaboration not only crosses disciplinary but also cultural and national boundaries. The strength of collaborations tend to decrease with distance, with progress hindered by language, cultural or institutional barriers (Pan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>). As has been documented in other inter-disciplinary networks (Janssen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2006</xref>), the development of an integrated inter-disciplinary community can be a slow and gradual process and (particularly in relation to collaborative publications) can be hindered by a lack of high quality inter-disciplinary journals (Janssen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2006</xref>). Network analysis seems to show that the formation of the MACSUR knowledge hub enabled members to overcome such barriers to some extent, with good integration between themes evident in the final network (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Personal compatibility can be more important than external incentives for fostering collaboration (Hara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>; Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2005</xref>) and it may be that the already-well connected partners of MACSUR were able to make best use of the opportunities offered by the project as a result of a pre-existing tendency to, and experience of, collaboration. Becoming aware of and getting to know potential collaborators can be a significant limiting factor in forming new working relationships (Cainelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014</xref>; Hara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>; Tomassini and Luthi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2007</xref>) and this might also be true for identifying networking structures and opportunities that could ease the process. Once MACSUR was formed, regular meetings and focus on communication and translation within the community were used to help members overcome some of the barriers to collaboration. As communication between partners continues, the resultant building of trust and understanding across disciplinary and cultural boundaries might be expected to facilitate further growth of community cohesiveness.
