<p class="p">Among the early outcomes of collaboration within MACSUR were several multi-author review papers, bringing together authors from many disciplines (e.g. Ewert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>; Rötter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2013</xref>; Trnka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2011</xref>). The publication of these ‘position’ papers can to some extent explain the observed changes in the network, and can be seen as evidence of synergy developing between disciplines as the result of short-term project-based collaboration (Siedlok and Hibbert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>). It remains to be seen whether continued work within MACSUR can foster longer term re-configuration of disciplines and the formation of a stable community of researchers repeatedly engaging in interdisciplinary work (Siedlok and Hibbert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, considering that the members of MACSUR are drawn from very diverse disciplines such as crop science, economics and livestock science, the observed changes are a positive sign of growing interdisciplinary collaboration within the knowledge hub.
