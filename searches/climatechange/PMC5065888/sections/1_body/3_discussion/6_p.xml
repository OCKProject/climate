<p class="p">The search for papers in the field of Climate Change and agriculture beyond the MACSUR members’ network revealed a very large and active research community with a steady increase in publications apparent between 2008 and 2014. The density and connectedness of the resulting co-authorship network was very low, suggesting that this is not as yet a cohesive community. The network of all authors could be broken down into a large number of components, with a high degree of connectedness within the components and low connectedness between them. This is consistent with the experiences from other interdisciplinary fields (Fields

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). The fast growth of the core component of the MACSUR members’ network was not visible in the network formed by the wider field of Climate Change and agricultural research. Instead, a continued and gradual increase both in the overall network diameter and in the size of the largest component was observed. Although this is suggestive of an increase in interdisciplinary links throughout the study period, this growth could largely be accounted for by the overall increase in author numbers.
