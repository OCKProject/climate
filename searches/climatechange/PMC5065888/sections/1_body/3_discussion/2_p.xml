<p class="p">Initially, analysis showed the MACSUR community to be highly fragmented, but the connectedness and size of the largest network component grew throughout the study period, with a considerable shift in network structure between the third and fourth time-windows as this large component united the network. This mirrors earlier observations of network development (Liu and Xia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>; Tomassini and Luthi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2007</xref>). The catalyst for the quick growth of such core clusters can be unclear (Liu and Xia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>), although for the “Genetic Programming” community studied by Tomassini and Luthi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2007</xref>) the appearance of the dominant component coincided with the first general conference in the field. Newman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2001</xref>) found that authors who have neighbours in common (i.e., authors who have collaborated with the same co-authors) have a higher probability of themselves becoming collaborators, so that fast growth in network connectivity arises through a process of preferential attachment between members. Liu and Xia (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>) identified three stages in this pattern of growth in co-authorship networks: “segregation”, “chained communities” and “small world”. An initial merging of small collaborative clusters is seen within disciplinary boundaries, which then form the nuclei for linking to other relatively close disciplines. Finally, the emergence of a large single component occurs as a result of linking multiple disciplinary communities. This final stage represents much greater interdisciplinary collaboration, and convergence of research themes into a new paradigm (Liu and Xia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). It can be expected to lead to a densification of the network (Bettencourt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2009</xref>). For the network of MACSUR members, the high degree of densification and the shift towards a single large component coinciding with the establishment of the knowledge hub, suggests that the research structure of the project may have played an instrumental part in initiating the change.
