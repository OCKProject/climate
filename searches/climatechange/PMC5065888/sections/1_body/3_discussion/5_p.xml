<p class="p">Although the degree centrality of MACSUR partners was observed to rise during the active period of the project, this group of researchers also began with a significantly higher degree centrality and betweenness centrality than other authors in the Climate Change and agriculture community (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Authors with more experience of networking and an open attitude to collaborative working may have been more motivated to join MACSUR, or their connections might have meant that they were better informed about the opportunity to take part. The high betweenness centrality of MACSUR members suggests that these authors may have a sizeable influence over the information flow in the research community (Newman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2004</xref>) and may therefore attract more new co-authors, further cementing their control over information flow through the network (Abbasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2012</xref>). In some cases these kinds of pattern may lead to the emergence of exclusive groupings of researchers centred on a few key knowledge brokers (Abbasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2012</xref>) and present barriers to entry for others; research from other domains also suggests that over-stability within collaborations can have a negative effect on performance (Turrini et al. 2010). In this context, identifying ways to widen participation in knowledge hubs and similar networking and research structures will be important to making full use of the diversity of research expertise available in the EU and beyond.
