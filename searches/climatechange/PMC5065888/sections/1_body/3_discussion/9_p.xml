<p class="p">This paper sought to describe the potential of network analysis to characterise the success of a major inter-disciplinary initiative in growing collaborative links between researchers. Previously several such analyses have been carried out within disciplinary fields (e.g. mathematics: Brunson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2013</xref>; Industrial Ecology: Kim and Perez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>); moving beyond this to the inter-disciplinary level posed methodological challenges, particularly around the definition of the boundaries of the research network. A more focused database search might have yielded a narrower range of papers, and perhaps identified a more close-knit network of Climate Change and agricultural researchers. However, it would have missed a large number of MACSUR members and would not have fully represented the interdisciplinary and broad nature of the MACSUR knowledge hub or the network from which it is drawn.
