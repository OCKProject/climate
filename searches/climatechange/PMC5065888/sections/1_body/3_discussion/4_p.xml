<p class="p">The MACSUR knowledge hub has only been in existence for 3 years, and previous experience shows that a much longer period (up to 10 years) may be needed for the impact of enhanced collaborative opportunities to translate into dramatic increases in numbers of co-authored papers (Tomassini and Luthi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2007</xref>). Among the challenges to developing long-term stable communities of inter-disciplinary researchers are the lack of shared framing of topics and a lack of interaction between scientists (Brandt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>). EU funding policies have facilitated the development of research networks which are much more diverse and spread over a greater geographical distance than many other collaborative efforts (Gusmao 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2001</xref>). Although it has often been hard to say whether this approach has promoted the formation of a genuinely cohesive European scientific community (Gusmao 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2001</xref>) specific networks have shown some evidence of integration, even when participants have been drawn from a wide range of backgrounds (Janssen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2006</xref>). The network studied here shows the establishment of interdisciplinary collaborations, through co-authorship links between authors from different disciplines within the MACSUR community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For MACSUR, success in sustaining the observed improvements will be a further important milestone for the knowledge hub.
