<p class="p">In order to evaluate the impact of the MACSUR knowledge hub as a tool for fostering cohesion and capacity building across scientific disciplines, the development of collaboration was studied by applying network analysis to a database of co-authored peer reviewed journal papers. Evidence was found for an effect of the knowledge hub, with the degree centrality of MACSUR members showing a significant increase during the active period of the project. Network centrality of an author has been positively correlated with measures of performance (Abbasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2011</xref>; Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2005</xref>; Uddin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2013</xref>) with authors having a larger numbers of collaborators also more likely to engage in new collaborations. The observed increase in degree centrality within the MACSUR membersâ€™ network is therefore a positive sign in terms of the impact of the knowledge hub on scientific capacity.
