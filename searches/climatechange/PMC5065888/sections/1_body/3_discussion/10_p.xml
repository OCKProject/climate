<p class="p">Throughout the study period, the majority of papers identified across the Climate Change and Agricultural field were co-authored by more than two authors, and by authors from different institutions. Generally, science has seen an increase in between-institute collaboration, with multi-institute partnerships the fastest growing form of authorship (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2008</xref>; Leydesdorff and Wagner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2008</xref>; The Royal Society 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2011</xref>). Over time, geographic distance is becoming less important as a determinant of collaboration (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2008</xref>), though language and culture still present significant barriers to collaboration (Hoekman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>; Katz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1994</xref>; Katz and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1997</xref>; Luukkonen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">1992</xref>). Therefore, assessments of success for projects aimed at capacity building through collaboration need to compare performance against changes in the wider background community, in order to ascertain their real added value. In this study, changes in the structure of the MACSUR partnersâ€™ network were distinct from those observed at the level of the broader Climate Change and agriculture network, indicating a positive impact of MACSUR even a relatively short time after its initiation.
