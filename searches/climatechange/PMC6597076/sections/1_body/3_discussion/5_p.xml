<p class="p">The Forecasting model used in this study is based on the AFLA-maize model [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], which is a weather-driven model. This model potentially can be improved and expanded with latest study results on A. flavus growth and AfB1 production [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. These studies provide latest interactions between 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> growth and different factors, such as pH, water activities and temperatures. In addition to the weather factors, various other factors can also affect the AfB1 level in maize, such as the resistance level of maize hybrids, fertilizer use, fungicide application, pest pressure and crop management. A forecasting model considering both weather and agronomic factors would be interesting to develop in future research. Studies on other AfB1 producing 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., such as 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">parasiticus</italic>, can be added in the future studies. Although there are several options to further improve and expand the AFLA-maize model, we chose to simplify it. The reason is that we wanted an approach that can be applied at the European level using (open) available data. Variables such as pH, water activity and local agronomic information are not available with European coverage at this moment.
