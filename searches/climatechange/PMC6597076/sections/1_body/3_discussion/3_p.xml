<p class="p">In the current study, it was not taken into account where (which grid) in Ukraine maize was grown; instead, the predicted aflatoxin levels in maize were averaged over all grid cells in the country (and all years). The reason is that information on the exact origin of maize imported from Ukraine to the Netherlands was not available. However, the current study is a first demonstration of the modelling framework. Since the aflatoxin forecasting model predicts on a 25x25 degree grid, it is possible to select more detailed regions of origin and more specific forecasts can be obtained, likely leading to model outcomes that cover a wider range of values. We focused in this study on AfB1 formation during maize cultivation, up to harvest. AfB1 can also be formed during consecutive transport and storage of the maize, under favourable conditions for
