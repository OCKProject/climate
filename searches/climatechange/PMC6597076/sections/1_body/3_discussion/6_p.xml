<p class="p">With increasing globalisation and trade, traceability of food is of continuously growing concern. Food products and ingredients are shipped from one part of the globe to another. Therefore, it has become important for all stakeholders of the food supply chain, from producers, traders and processors up to consumers, to build systems that collect real-time information to trace products from “farm-to-fork”. A traceability system based on blockchains combined with the current modelling framework would enable identification of risky routes in a food production chain. But also as stand-alone modelling framework, scenario analyses can be done, e.g. with climate change scenarios or feeding regimes of cows. Results of such scenario analyses could assist risk managers of private industry and governments in decision making processes.</p>
