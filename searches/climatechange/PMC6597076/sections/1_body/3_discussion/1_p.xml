<p class="p">This study aimed to link all available models and data for the case of aflatoxins in the dairy production chain, from the cows’ feed until the food product (milk). Results of this study showed that, given projected climate change, aflatoxin contamination in milk is expected to be comparable to or to increase, relative to the baseline situation. Whether or not an increase is to be expected strongly depends on the climate model and carryover equation used. We used Monte Carlo simulation and the resulting range in outcomes reflect both variability and uncertainty, in both climate modelling and carryover modelling. Uncertainty can be reduced by collecting additional data. E.g., for the carryover model, additional carryover experiments with AfB1 from dairy cows’ feed to AfM1 in milk could be done to reduce the uncertainty related to using the current carryover equations. In the current study, three climate models were used, to represent the range of uncertainty and variability, but only one climate change scenario was considered. Since we focused on the near future, the various climate scenarios do not differ so much, and more difference is expected from the various climate models. In addition, as pragmatic reason, data were available for the current climate scenario data. For looking into the farther future, including multiple climate scenarios as well as multiple climate models would be advisable.</p>
