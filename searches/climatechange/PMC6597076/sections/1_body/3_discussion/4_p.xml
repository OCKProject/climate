<p class="p">This case study focused on a specific safety hazard (AfB1), feed ingredient (maize) and animal (cow) for this workflow. With the chain modelling approach, the transition of this specific toxin throughout the dairy production chain, from “farm-to-fork”, is simulated. The developed framework is flexible so that models for other mycotoxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol) and grain types (e.g. wheat, oats), such as the forecasting model for deoxynivalenol in winter wheat grown in the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], can easily be implemented within this framework. This study used Ukrainian maize as an example for the demonstration purpose. The method presented can be applied for any European country using country specific climate data at JRC agri4cast data portal. More generally, the framework can be extended to available models for other food safety hazards, and crops and/or animal production chains.
