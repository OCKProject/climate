<p class="p">AfB1 contamination of maize grown in Ukraine is generally expected to increase under climate change, particularly with the ETHZ and METO models, but variability increased as well. Mean contamination over all grids in Ukraine and model iterations was higher than in the baseline situation, except for the DMI model, but the standard deviation was higher as well. The DMI model predicts Ukraine to be colder and receive more precipitation than do the ETHZ and METO models (
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), so it appears from the models that warmer conditions with less precipitation lead to increased aflatoxin contamination of maize. This is consistent with literature that states the increase in aflatoxins could be due to the expected increase in temperature and relative humidity and/or drought by reduced rainfall since these three factors increase the presence of

They also observed a general increase in aflatoxin contamination of maize, particularly in Southern Europe, though variation between grids and climate change scenarios was also large.
