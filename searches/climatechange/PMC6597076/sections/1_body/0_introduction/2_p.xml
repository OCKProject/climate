<p class="p">So far, parts of the dairy supply chain have been modelled: the effect of climate change on AfB1 contamination of maize; prediction of AfB1 contamination of maize (ingredient of compound feed to dairy cows), and; carryover from AfB1 intake by dairy cows into AfM1 in milk produced by these cows [

 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. To date, the various datasets and models related to AfB1 in the maize and AfM1 in the dairy production chain have not yet been linked with each other. If such an integrated approach would be taken, the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the final product, the cowâ€™s milk, could be estimated. Such scenario analyses could be done with the aim of facilitating decision making by policy makers and other risk managers.
