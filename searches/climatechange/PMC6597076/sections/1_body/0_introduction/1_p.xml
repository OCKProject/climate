<p class="p">Aflatoxins are a group of related mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced as secondary metabolites by several toxigenic fungi upon and after infection of crops. Given their occurrence and toxicity, the European Commission (EC) has set limits for the combined presence of the four aflatoxins B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, B
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, G
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, and G
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, as well as for the presence of aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (AfB1) in feed and aflatoxin M
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (AfM1) in food [

 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, G
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and G

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> appear to be conversion products of AfB1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Aflatoxins were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as class 1, implying “there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of aflatoxins” [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. AfB1 is mainly produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">parasiticus</italic> in feed and food crops, such as maize [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. When AfB1 occurs in feed and is consumed by dairy cattle, a variety of symptoms can occur, which includes un-thriftiness, anorexia and decreased milk production [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The digestion system of the lactating animals (e.g. dairy cows, goats and sheep) converts some of the ingested AfB1 into AfM1 which is excreted in milk [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. As a result, AfM1 can be present in dairy products, such as milk, leading to exposure of humans to this toxic component. Since milk is an important foodstuff for adults and children, the presence of AfM1 can pose a risk to human health [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In Europe, a tolerable daily intake of AfM1 has been set at 0.2 ng/kg b.w. and limits have been set for its maximum presence in food products, i.e., 0.05μg/kg for raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk for the manufacture of milk-based products [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In 2013, a large shipment of maize from East Europe, which was distributed to feed producers in Germany and the Netherlands, was found to be contaminated with AfB1. AfB1 concentrations, as reported by Germany to the Rapid Alert System Food and Feed (RASFF) system, ranged from 21–204 μg/kg, which were far above the EC legal limit for AfB1 in maize for feed (20 μg/kg). Dairy farms in Germany and the Netherlands were affected as well, since AfM1 was found in the milk at farms that used compound feed produced from the AfB1 contaminated maize, and a major recall started. As a result of this incident, the Dutch feed industry has largely intensified their regular monitoring of AfB1 in maize intended for feed production [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Additionally, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority also monitors the presence of AfB1 in maize used for feed production, as part of the National Plan Animal Feed. Infection of the host crop (in this case maize) by the responsible fungus 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">flavus</italic> is to a large extent influenced by local weather and by agronomical practices, such as the cultivar, tillage method, and crop rotation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Weather conditions facilitating infection of the host crop with 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">flavus</italic> are warm and humid conditions as well as droughts. Temperature, precipitation patterns and other climate factors are expected to change due to greenhouse gas emissions. Climate modelling studies project that temperature will continue to increase gradually over time, resulting in a 2 °C to 5 °C increase of 1-in-20 year extreme daily maximum temperature by the late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The distribution of precipitation is expected to change, resulting in an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In many mid-latitude dry regions (i.e. maize growing area), mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These changes will likely affect infection of maize with 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">flavus</italic> and resulting AfB1 contamination. A previous study has estimated that within the next 100 years, a 2 °C or 5 °C increase in temperature is expected to increase AfB1 contamination of maize in parts of Europe, especially with the +2 °C scenario, relative to their baseline of 1975–2005 [

 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It should be noted that scenario analysis is a tool to explore different plausible futures, but does not give information about the probability of occurrence of a given outcome [
