<p class="p">The aim of the current study was to investigate the impacts of climate change on aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> production in maize and its consequences on aflatoxin M
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> contamination in dairy cowâ€™s milk, using a full chain modelling approach. Based on the 2013 incident described above, we focused on milk production on a typical Dutch dairy farm that uses compound feed for the dairy cows with imported maize from Eastern Europe (Ukraine) as an ingredient, as a case study to demonstrate the potential of chain modelling and scenario analysis for food safety.
