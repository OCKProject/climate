<p class="p">According to our model, maize grown in Ukraine is expected to have a mean AfB1 concentration of 0.8 Î¼g/kg, under baseline weather conditions (
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This mean represents the mean of all simulation runs for all grids. In future, mean AfB1 concentrations of maize grown in Ukraine are expected to decrease (-25% DMI) or increase (+52% ETHZ, +93% METO) for the year 2030. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> visualizes the predicted mean AfB1 concentrations in maize for the baseline and the different climate models. Local variation in AfB1 concentrations can be observed; highest concentrations are expected in south-east Ukraine (
