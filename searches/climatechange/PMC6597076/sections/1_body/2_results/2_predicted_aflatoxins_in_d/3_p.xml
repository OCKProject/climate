<p class="p">The DMI model predicts threshold exceedances to be similar to the baseline. The ETHZ model predicts threshold exceedances slightly higher than the baseline. The strongest increase in the number of times the limit is reached is expected for the METO model. Again the outcome depends strongly on the transfer equation used.</p>
