<p class="p">The framework infrastructure is flexible so that models for other mycotoxins or food safety hazards and production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. Forecasting models for mycotoxins in other compound feed crops, i.e. wheat, barley, can be added in parallel with the maize forecasting model to study the impact of climate change on mycotoxins in more compound feed ingredients. This study used Eastern European maize as an example for the demonstration purpose. The method presented can be applied for any European country using available country specific climate data. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models reported in literature related to AfB1 in maize and related AfM1 in the dairy production chain together to obtain a unique predictive method based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product and to adopt appropriate prevention measures.</p>
