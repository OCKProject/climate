<p class="p">This study aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change on AfB1 production in maize and its consequences on AfM1 contamination in dairy cow’s milk, using a full chain modelling approach. Results showed that, given the case study, the scenarios and models used, AfB1 contamination in milk was expected to be comparable or to increase in future climate. For this case study of Ukrainian maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean AfM1 in milk by 2030, except for DMI model suggesting a decrease. All calculations suggest a stable—with a slightly increase (up to 0.6%)- probability of finding AfM1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 μg/kg by 2030. Results mainly depended on the climate model and carryover model used.</p>
