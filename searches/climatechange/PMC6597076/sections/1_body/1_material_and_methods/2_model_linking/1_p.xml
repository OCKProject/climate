 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and a Carryover Model [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] were used in our setup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The general setup is a sequence of data and models that are chained together, and in which output from one model forms the basis for input to another model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Maize flowering and harvest dates (D, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) were estimated using temperature sum (TSUM) data (B, Fig1) from the Joint Research Centre (JRC) crop database and weather data from the JRC weather database (C, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The Forecasting model (1, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) predicts AfB1 concentrations in maize based on simulating fungal dispersal, growth and AfB1 production, using the estimated flowering and harvest dates (D, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) and data on the model weather variables (A, C, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) as input. Weather data and TSUM data from Ukraine were used as a case study to run the Forecasting model. Input data covered all European countries’ baseline weather data and 90 years of simulated future weather representing the year 2030 produced by three climate models (European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/), see section Data Used for details on input data. Then, for data of the baseline and the three climate models, we determined the mean and standard deviation of the predicted AfB1 contamination levels in maize grown (F, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) in Ukraine now and in the future. These were used as input for contamination of maize used as compound feed in the Carryover model (2, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), that predicts consequent AfM1 concentrations in milk (I, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218956.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) produced in the Netherlands. Calculations of AfM1 concentrations in milk were performed for the case of the bulk milk production of a typical Dutch dairy farm with 69 cows. The Carryover model used all transfer equations that are currently available (published in scientific literature) to account for uncertainty and variability in the transfer of AfB1 in dairy cows’ feed to AfM1 in dairy cows’ milk. The Carryover model was run 10000 times using Monte Carlo sampling. Section Models Used provides more details on the models.
