<p class="p">The carryover model uses AfB1 intake of the cows as input. AfB1 intake was considered a distribution, resulting from the amount of compound feed intake per cow (fixed value), the compound feed composition (range for inclusion rate per ingredient) and the presence of AfB1 in the compound feed (distribution of AfB1 per ingredient). For the latter, data on AfB1 concentrations in the feed ingredients were obtained from a database with 10 years of national monitoring results. However, data on the AfB1 concentration in maize used for compound feed production for dairy cows were replaced by the estimated AfB1 concentrations in maize, resulting from the aflatoxin Forecasting model, either in the baseline or given climate change data as inputs. To do so, mean and standard deviation (SD) of the estimated AfB1 concentrations over all Ukrainian grids and years were calculated and used for the distribution of AfB1 in maize. Model output is weekly resolved and aggregated for the whole farm. Aflatoxin binders are not commonly used in compound feed production in the Netherlands and their effect was therefore not included.</p>
