<p class="p">The aflatoxin Carryover simulation model [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] aims to estimate the concentrations of AfM1 in milk produced at the dairy farm from AfB1 intake of the dairy cows at the farm. The model simulates bulk milk production at a typical dairy farm in the Netherlands with an assumed average herd size of 69 dairy cows[
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The most common breed in the Netherlands for milk production is the Holstein-Friesian bred. The influence of individual differences between cows (size and breed) were not considered in the original study because milk batch contamination is only relevant at the farm level. The individual difference between cows would smooth out in the results. This model therefore assumed an average total daily feed intake (and standard deviation) of 18.7 (1.3) kg DM (Dry Matter)/cow, of which 4.3 (0.2) kg DM/cow is compound feed [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The Carryover model can be run with six different scenarios for compound feed composition and milk production (relative to feed intake) of the cows. These six scenarios are the results of: 1) three compound feed composition scenarios, namely High-Protein, Low-Protein and Feed Ingredient with Minimal and Maximal ranges (i.e. 0%-35% maize in compound feed), and 2) two different milk yield scenarios, namely normal and extreme lactation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. For the current case, we used the compound feed composition scenario with Minimal and Maximal ranges and the normal milk yield scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] to limit the number of scenarios for the demonstration purpose. With the Minimal and Maximal ranges, AfB1 concentrations in other feedstuffs than maize it taken from the ranges found in the national monitoring program in the Netherlands. The method presents in this study can be used to predict aflatoxin contamination under all six scenarios. Intake of roughage by dairy cows was not considered since roughage fed to dairy cows in the Netherlands (grass and silage) has a low probability to be contaminated with AfB1. The model is based on Monte Carlo simulation (10000 iterations), to account for variation and uncertainty related to the input variables of the model, mainly AfB1 concentrations in the feed ingredients and the carryover of AfB1 in maize to AfM1 in milk. The carryover of AfB1 from the feed–into the cow’s body–to AfM1 in the milk was simulated by using published carryover equations. The transfer rate used to set the EC legislative limit in feed for dairy cows was 1%-2% [
