<p class="p">Data on emergence date, temperature sum (TSUM) per grid cell (25km × 25km) from the crop phenology model WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) developed under EU Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) project were used to estimate flowering dates and harvest dates of maize [
 <xref rid="pone.0218956.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. TSUM is a fixed value, per grid, of temperature sum to estimate flowering date and harvest date relative to emergence date. TSUM1 is the accumulated daily average temperature from emergence date until flowering date. TSUM2 is the accumulated daily average temperature from flowering date to harvest date. Gridded TSUM1 and TSUM2 values, as available in the JRC database, were used to estimate flowering date (TSUM1) and harvest date (TSUM1 + TSUM2) of the maize crop for each grid cell. For maize, TSUM starts to accumulate when daily average temperature is between 6°C and 30°C. The temperature out of this range is considered not suitable for maize to grow [
