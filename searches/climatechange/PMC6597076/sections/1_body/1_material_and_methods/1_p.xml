<p class="p">A modelling approach was used in which data and available models at various stages of the dairy production chain, from maize cultivation to cowâ€™s milk production, were linked with each other. For our case study, we constrained our models based on a specific grain (Maize), animal (Cow), toxin (Aflatoxin), and country (Netherlands). We focused the modelling of the dairy production chain in the Netherlands, which currently imports most of its maize from Eastern Europe, in particular from Ukraine [

The general setup of the model chain, input data, and details of the various models are explained in the following sections. All data and models are available (
