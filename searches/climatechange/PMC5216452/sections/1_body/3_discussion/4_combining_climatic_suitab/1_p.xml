<p class="p">Urban and suburban areas usually function as centres of introduction and cultivation for ornamentals, and the proportion of introduced species usually decreases dramatically along an urban–rural gradient (Kowarik,

Combining projections of climatic suitability with the proportional area of the respective land‐use types hence pinpoints some densely populated and economically prosperous regions in Europe as potential naturalization hotspots despite a sub‐optimal climate, e.g. Great Britain under current climatic conditions. By contrast, relatively large areas appear less threatened although they would be climatically suited to many garden plants, at least under a warmer climate, like most of the coastal Balkan Peninsula, Ireland or some southern parts of coastal Scandinavia.
