<p class="p">The risk maps presented here assume, however, that current land‐cover patterns in Europe remain unchanged. Whether and how these patterns will change depends on future European socio‐economic policies (Spangenberg

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study projecting invasion levels in Europe as dependent on land‐use change scenarios for the 21st century revealed patterns that partly resemble those found in our study, particularly with respect to rising naturalization risk in north‐western and northern Europe (Chytrý 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Taken together, these parts of Europe will hence offer both climatically more suitable conditions and land‐use patterns more susceptible to alien plant establishment in the future. By contrast, in the easternmost parts of the continent rising climatic suitability to potential invaders might be attenuated by abandonment and loss of former agricultural land in these economically marginal areas (Chytrý
