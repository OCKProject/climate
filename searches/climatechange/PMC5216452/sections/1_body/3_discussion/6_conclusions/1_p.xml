<p class="p">One of the greatest uncertainties in assessing the invasion risk of ornamental plants comes from the difficulty of estimating the potential impacts of climate change (Dehnen‐Schmutz, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Despite pronounced species‐specific differences, our results suggest that climate warming leads to an increase in currently cultivated garden plants able to naturalize in Europe as well as the area across which they may spread. Which species will eventually become invasive or have a negative environmental and/or economic impact cannot be inferred from our models. However, a larger number of naturalized species probably also implies a greater risk of impact if the ratio of naturalized and harmful species remains about constant (Jeschke &amp; Strayer, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In addition, the growing importance of trade in ornamental plants via the internet (Humair 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) increasingly removes any limitations on the availability of particular plants for the individual customer and hence largely eliminates the dispersal barriers that control range responses of non‐cultivated species to climate warming (Svenning &amp; Sandel, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). As a corollary, raising awareness of the invasion problem among individuals and institutions involved in gardening, urban landscaping and the horticultural trade appears even more important in the face of a warming climate.
