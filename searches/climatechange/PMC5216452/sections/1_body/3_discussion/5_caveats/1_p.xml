<p class="p">The use of species distribution models to predict range shifts under changing climatic conditions has important limitations, mainly related to the disregard of biotic interactions (e.g. Wisz 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), intraspecific variation in niche breadth (Valladares 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), dispersal limitations (Svenning &amp; Skov, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and, particularly in an invasion context, possible niche shifts (Early &amp; Sax, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the case of our study, biotic interactions may be of limited relevance because the spatial resolution of our predictions is far beyond the scale at which plants usually interact (Pearson &amp; Dawson, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Likewise, dispersal limitation is probably less relevant as we model potential ranges of species that are actively distributed by humans, and for which the frequency of long‐distance dispersal events can be expected to rise sharply in the future with the growing importance of e‐commerce in the ornamental plant trade (Lenda 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Humair 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, not all the plants modelled here will be traded and cultivated with equal intensity, and even of those planted frequently, only a subset will escape into the wild (Dehnen‐Schmutz 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). We hence stress that the numbers of species predicted in our study should not be taken at face value but represent a measure of spatial and temporal variation of naturalization risk. On the other hand, we note that the pool of potential invaders among European garden plants might be even larger than assumed here because species could become established or even invasive in Europe although they have not yet done so in other regions of the world. Finally, with respect to niche shifts, we took care to parameterize our models not only with data from the native ranges of the species but also from all those areas where they have already naturalized. While this strategy should characterize the climatic potential of species as accurately as possible, further changes to realized niches during their possible future establishment and invasion in Europe can of course not be completely excluded.
