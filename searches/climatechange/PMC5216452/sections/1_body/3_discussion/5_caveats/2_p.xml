<p class="p">The reliability of species distribution models depends on the quality of the data used to fit them. GBIF combines the advantage of global coverage, and hence the possibility to fit niches of species comprehensively, with the disadvantage of the errors and biases implicit in such large databases (Meyer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, we do not think that these errors and biases affect our results qualitatively. First, we took care to handle taxonomic problems and spatial errors when extracting occurrence data. Second, the poor coverage of northern Asia, and Russia in particular, which is probably the most important geographical bias of GBIF in our context, has little impact on our results as the number of species native to Russia in our pool is low (38 species). In addition, the detected increase of the invasion level is especially pronounced for species from nemoral and laurophyllous zonobiomes, which are mostly situated in regions with especially high record densities. Third, although predictions for individual species might suffer from inaccuracies, the multispecies patterns predicted here are consistently interpretable in terms of geographical gradients of climatic harshness in Europe, and hence appear highly plausible.
