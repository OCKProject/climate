<p class="p">Our results demonstrate that there is a sizeable pool of species which: (1) are planted in European gardens, at least locally, and hence already exert a certain amount of propagule pressure, (2) have proven their naturalization capacity in other parts of the world, and (3) find abundant suitable climatic space in Europe. The risk that at least some of these species will become naturalized in Europe in the future appears substantial, and it is likely that this risk will increase as climate change intensifies.</p>
