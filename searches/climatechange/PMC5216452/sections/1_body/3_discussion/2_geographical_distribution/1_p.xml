<p class="p">Climatically suitable areas for potential naturalization of garden plants are unequally distributed across Europe. Most parts of northern and eastern Europe are unsuitable for the vast majority of the analysed species under current climatic conditions, whereas hotspots are concentrated along the southern and western Atlantic shorelines and the eastern Adriatic coast. This geographical contrast suggests that not only temperature but a combination of temperature and precipitation regimes controls current patterns of climatic suitability for garden plants in Europe. The peculiarity of the Atlantic coastal areas, in particular, is a combination of relatively mild winters and humid summers keeping both frost and aridity stress low. These areas are hence likely to be within physiological tolerance limits of species from a wide array of different origins. By contrast, the Mediterranean region is warm enough in winter for nearly all selected species to be cultivated (Cullen

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), but arid summers represent a climatic filter to naturalization. In line with this interpretation, the Balkan coastal area, which receives more precipitation than all other parts of the Mediterranean coast in Europe, is the only Mediterranean region that ranks among potential naturalization hotspots. In the eastern and northern parts of Europe, the climate is generally colder and/or more continental, with low winter temperatures, dry summers or a combination of both. These conditions are obviously hostile to the naturalization of most species from the current pool of European garden plants.
