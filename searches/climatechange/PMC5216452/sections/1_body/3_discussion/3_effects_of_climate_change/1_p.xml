<p class="p">Release from climatic restrictions has been identified as a major potential driver of rising invasion risk under climate warming (e.g. Walther

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Our results generally support this notion. The prevailing pattern detected is an increasing number of potential invaders, in particular of laurophyllous and nemoral origin, in more northern and eastern parts of Europe and a concurrent shift of potential naturalization hotspots. This predicted expansion of climatically suitable ranges is particularly worrisome in the case of ornamental plants because many of them are already cultivated far beyond conditions that would currently allow population establishment in the wild (Van der Veken 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The presence of species propagules in regions that become newly climatically suitable to them effectively lifts dispersal limitations, and may therefore allow the naturalization of garden plants to keep track with climate change more closely than is commonly assumed for native plants (e.g. Corlett &amp; Westcott,
