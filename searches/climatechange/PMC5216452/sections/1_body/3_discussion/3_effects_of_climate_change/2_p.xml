<p class="p">The mean increase of climatically suitable area, however, masks pronounced variation among species. For a sizeable minority of the study species, the potential range is predicted to shrink under climate change, and under the most pronounced scenario the number of species finding suitable climate in &lt; 1% of the European area (320 cells) is approximately the same as under current conditions (442 vs. 441 species). The reasons for climatic range loss are likely to differ among individual species, but the fact that ‘losers’ are particularly widespread among species of boreal and Mediterranean origin suggests that two factors may be of particular importance. First, species adapted to cool conditions might lose potential area because temperatures become too warm in most parts of Europe. Second, species that would currently find climatically suitable area in Mediterranean Europe may not be able to deal with the more arid conditions that are predicted for these regions (Mariotti

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) while, simultaneously, winter temperature does not become warm enough to compensate for such loss by expansion to the more northern, temperate parts of Europe. In accordance with the latter assumption, the regions that are currently both warm and relatively moist but will become drier in the future, like the southern Atlantic coast and the Balkan coastal area, are (1) predicted to lose the highest numbers of potential invaders and (2) are geographically separated from the more northern areas that show highest increases in the number of potential invaders.
