 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The four modelling algorithms used were: generalized linear model (GLM), general additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF). Since those algorithms require presence and absence data, but GBIF provides just ‘presence‐only’ information, we generated ‘pseudo‐absences’ following the recommendations of Barbet‐Massin

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>): for the regression technique models (GLM and GAM), we used 10,000 randomly distributed absences, and for machine‐learning technique models (BRT and RF), we used a number of pseudo‐absences equal to the number of occurrences found in GBIF and selected outside a radius of 200 km around these occurrences. For the latter approach, pseudo‐absence generation, and hence model calibration, was repeated ten times per species to ensure that selected pseudo‐absences did not bias the final predictions. For all models, the weighted sum of presences equalled the weighted sum of pseudo‐absences. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated by means of the true skill statistic (TSS; Allouche

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) based on a repeated (three times) split‐sampling approach in which models were calibrated with 80% of the data and evaluated over the remaining 20%.
