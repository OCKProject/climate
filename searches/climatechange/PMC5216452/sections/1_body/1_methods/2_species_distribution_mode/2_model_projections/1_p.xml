<p class="p">Calibrated models were used to project the climatically suitable area for each species in Europe under current and possible future climatic conditions by means of an ensemble forecast approach (Araújo &amp; New, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). As pseudo‐absence generation differed between the two groups of models, we generated two separate ensemble predictions for each species, one from a combination of GLM and GAM, and one from a combination of BRT and RF models. In other words, the model projections from the repeated split‐sampling approach (and from the repeated pseudo‐absence selection in the case of BRT and RF) were aggregated to a weighted mean of projections. The contribution of each model to the ensemble forecast was weighted according to its TSS score. Models with a TSS score &lt; 0.5 were excluded from building projections (see Appendix S4 for full information on model performance). The two probabilistic ensemble forecasts were translated into two binary maps using the value that maximizes the TSS score as the threshold for distinguishing presence and absence predictions. The two binary maps were then combined to a final consensus map where a 10′ cell was defined to be suitable for a species (under a particular climate scenario) only if both binary ensemble layers predicted its presence. The latter decision rule makes the projections conservative, i.e. the extent of climatically suitable habitat is likely to be under‐ rather than overestimated.
