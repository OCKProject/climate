<p class="p">To analyse whether possible increases or decreases of alien ranges under climate change might depend on a species’ biogeographical origin, we assigned the native regions of our study species to the nine climatically defined zonobiomes distinguished by Walter &amp; Breckle (
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). Native regions were available for 704 of the 783 species in the GRIN database (

Where native regions were assigned to more than one zonobiome, species were assigned to all of these zonobiomes. Finally, we re‐did the same permutation tests as described above for the subset of species of each zonobiome separately.
