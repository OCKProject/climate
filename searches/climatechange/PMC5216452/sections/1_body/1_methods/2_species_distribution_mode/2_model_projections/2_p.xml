<p class="p">To assess whether potential alien ranges of the 783 species will, on average, increase, decrease or remain constant in Europe under future climates, we compared SDM projections under current and future climates in terms of the number of cells predicted to be suitable for these species. As the distribution of these numbers was highly skewed, with an excess of zeros, we used a permutation test to evaluate the significance of differences: for each species, we randomly reshuffled the number of cells predicted to occur under current conditions and the future scenario, respectively, and calculated the difference (cells in the future scenario minus cells under current conditions). This calculation was done 1000 times, resulting in a vector of 1000 mean differences among the 783 species, which is normally distributed and centred around zero. Finally, we assessed if the actually observed difference was within or outside the central 95 or 99.9% of the simulated differences.</p>
