 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) all vascular plant species not native to Europe. (The EGF is the most comprehensive encyclopaedia of ornamental plants in Europe.) From this pool of species, we selected those which have successfully naturalized somewhere outside Europe but not yet anywhere in Europe, based on the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF; van Kleunen 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), a newly established global alien plant species distribution database which contains lists of naturalized alien plants in more than 850 regions covering 83% of the world's terrestrial area. Cultivated taxa flagged as varieties or subspecies in the EGF were excluded to avoid overestimation when modelling the niches of the respective species. Moreover, we did not consider any taxa marked in the EGF as hybrids.
