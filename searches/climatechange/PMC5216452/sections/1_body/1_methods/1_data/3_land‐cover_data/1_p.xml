<p class="p">For the calculation of land‐cover weighted risk maps, we used CORINE land‐cover (CLC) data at a resolution of 100 m (EEA,

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>, for a similar approach). To safeguard against rating errors, we used three different weighting schemes, i.e. three different estimates of this proportional area per land‐cover class (see Appendix S3 for details). In all three schemes, the highest weights were given to classes including private and public garden spaces (e.g. green urban areas). Within each scheme, we subsequently calculated the area‐weighted means of these proportions for each 10′ × 10′ raster cell.
