<p class="p">For each climatic scenario, final binary consensus maps of all 783 species were stacked. From this overlay, we calculated for each 10′ grid cell (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 220 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at latitude 50° N) the number of species that would find suitable climatic conditions there. We defined potential naturalization hotspots as the 10% of cells that provide a suitable climate to the highest numbers of species. To depict potential contraction or expansion of hotspots, we mapped the relative change in the areal extent of hotspots in comparison with the current climatic situation by applying the top 10% cut‐off value (i.e. the number of species that separates the top 10% of the grid cells from the rest) determined under current conditions to the future climatic scenarios, too.
