<p class="p">The hotspot maps represent the number of species that are predicted to be able to naturalize in particular regions (10′ grid cells) based on their climatic requirements alone. Actual naturalization risk, however, also depends on the spatially variable amount of potential ornamental planting area. To create risk maps, we hence combined the stacked binary projections of the 783 species with each of the three weighted CORINE land‐cover maps by multiplying the number of potential invaders by the area available for ornamental plant cultivation. We again defined hotspots of naturalization risk as the 10% of cells with the highest such multiplied values. The three resulting risk maps, one per weighting scheme of land‐cover classes, were similar, but differed in some details (cf. Appendix S5). We hence created a final consensus map where hotspots of naturalization risk were defined as those cells flagged as such by at least two of the three alternative risk maps.</p>
