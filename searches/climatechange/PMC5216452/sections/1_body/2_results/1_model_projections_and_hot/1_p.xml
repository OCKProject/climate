<p class="p">For 455 (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 58%) of the 783 species included in our analysis, there is already a certain amount of suitable habitat (&gt; 100 cells) in Europe under current climatic conditions. The number of suitable grid cells varies considerably among species (minimum 0, maximum 18,059, i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 58% of Europe), but is already &gt; 1600 cells (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 5% of Europe) for 21% of the species (165 species). Per raster cell, the number of species predicted to encounter suitable climatic conditions ranges between 0 and 305 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). Northern and eastern Europe currently appear least suitable and western and southern Europe most suitable for our study species.
