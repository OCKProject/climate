<p class="p">Although part of the southern Atlantic and the Balkan coasts will lose potential invaders under climate warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), they nevertheless remain among those areas climatically suitable to a particularly high proportion of the analysed ornamental plants. The increasing extent of climatic hotspot area is mainly driven by a gradual expansion to the north including most of the British Isles, parts of north‐western continental Europe, southern Norway and the western Pannonian region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b–d). However, most of northern and eastern Europe still does not qualify as a climatic hotspot, even under the most severe climatic scenario, although the number of potential invaders increases considerably there (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b–d).
