<p class="p">Separating species according to their biogeographical origin demonstrates that those native to nemoral and laurophyllous zonobiomes profit most, especially under the most severe scenario, while those native to boreal and Mediterranean zonobiomes benefit least or even decrease in mean range size under the most severe climate scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, at least some species from any zonobiome show particularly strong reduction or enlargement of potential range size under each climate scenario, with pronounced losers being particularly frequent among boreal, nemoral and Mediterranean species (Fig.
