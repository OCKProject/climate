<p class="p">Under a warmer climate, both the mean potential range size per study species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a–c) and the number of species finding particularly large climatically suitable ranges in Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d) increase. Enlargement of mean potential range sizes is greater the more pronounced the climate‐change scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, not all the analysed species are predicted to profit from warmer climates. The modelled species pool is separated into those likely to gain and those which will lose climatically suitable area in a warmer Europe. The gap between these two groups becomes, again, the more pronounced the more severe the climatic scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a–c).
