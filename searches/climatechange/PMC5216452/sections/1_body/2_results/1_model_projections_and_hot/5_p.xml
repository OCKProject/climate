<p class="p">Under current climatic conditions 10% of Europe is climatically suitable for at least 70 from our pool of 783 species. These climatic hotspots are clustered along the Atlantic coast of Portugal, Spain, France and the southern British Isles as well as along the Mediterranean coast of the Balkan Peninsula and in southern central Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Under future climates, the hotspot area is predicted to grow, i.e. the area that provides climatically suitable habitat to ≥ 70 species will become larger by 62% under RCP2.6, by 75% under RCP4.5 and by 102% under RCP8.5 (i.e. more than doubling) (Fig.
