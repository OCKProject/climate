<p class="p">Similar to the extent of climatic hotspots, the area of high naturalization risk is predicted to grow under climate warming by 28% under RCP2.6, by 30% under RCP4.5 and by 68% under RCP8.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f–h). Weighting by land‐cover, however, results in some important changes to the purely climatic hotspot patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="geb12512-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e–h). High‐risk areas tend to extend further eastwards into densely populated areas of central and eastern Europe under all climate scenarios. By contrast, most of the Balkan coastal regions as well as parts of the Spanish coast are climatic hotspots under all scenarios but do not qualify as high‐risk areas. Finally, parts of north‐western Europe (e.g. Ireland, Scotland) and the southern Scandinavian coast become climatic hotspots when climate warms, but still do not appear to be areas with high naturalization risk.
