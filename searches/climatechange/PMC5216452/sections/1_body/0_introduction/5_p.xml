<p class="p">Here, we follow this rationale and explore whether the naturalization risk from currently cultivated garden plants will increase under a warmer climate in Europe. In essence, we first define the pool of non‐native garden plants that have already naturalized as aliens somewhere outside of the continent, but not in Europe itself. Second, we parameterize species distribution models and use them to assess to what extent these species would already find suitable conditions for naturalization under the current climate and whether potential alien ranges would increase, on average, under three scenarios of climate warming. Third, we combine predictions for individual species into a ‘hotspot analysis’ (O'Donnell

Finally, we overlay these climatic hotspot maps with a weighted land‐cover map accounting for the amount of potential ornamental planting area of each land‐cover class (EEA,
