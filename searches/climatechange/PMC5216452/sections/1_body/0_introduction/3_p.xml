 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). For vascular plants, intentional introduction for ornamental use has been identified as the major pathway world‐wide (Hulme 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In Europe, for example, more than 16,000 species from more than 200 families are currently in cultivation for ornamental purposes (Cullen 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Public and domestic gardens thus contain the greatest pool of non‐native plants on the continent (Niinemets &amp; Peñuelas, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The chance that in a warming Europe future invaders will primarily emerge from this pool is further increased by the fact that garden plants are often cultivated beyond the climatic limits of their natural populations and hence may get ‘a head start on climate change’ (Van der Veken 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In addition, horticulture often selects for traits that also promote naturalization and spread, such as rapid growth, early and prolific reproduction and disease resistance (Mack,
