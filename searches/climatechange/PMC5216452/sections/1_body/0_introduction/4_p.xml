<p class="p">It remains hard to predict which particular species from the pool of introduced garden plants will actually manage to naturalize or even become invasive. What we do know, however, is: (1) species that have already managed to become naturalized somewhere in the world are more likely to escape from cultivation in other regions too (Williamson, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>); and (2) that climate matching between native and introduced range is one of the few factors that consistently predicts invasion success across taxonomic groups and regions (Thuiller 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Hayes &amp; Barry, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Using these two ‘filters’ should hence help to at least select a subset of species with a higher risk of future naturalization and spread.
