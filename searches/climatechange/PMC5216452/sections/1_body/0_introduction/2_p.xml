<p class="p">As climatic suitability of the new territory is particularly crucial for naturalization and spread (Catford 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), expected climate change may importantly modify the number and identity of already introduced species able to pass to these subsequent invasion stages. Indeed, many examples have already been documented of alien species that have naturalized and/or started to spread in a region because recent warming trends have lifted former climatic limitations (Walther 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Predicting which species from a given pool of non‐natives might actually benefit from upcoming climate warming, and where these species might become naturalized or invasive in the future, would provide a valuable basis for proactive management (Bradley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). So far, however, research efforts have concentrated on potential range expansions of species that have already become harmful (e.g. O'Donnell 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Bellard 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or at least naturalized (Duursma 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) in the recipient area. These pre‐selections exclude potentially large numbers of species introduced but not yet naturalized or invasive, which make up the pending invasion debt of a region (Essl
