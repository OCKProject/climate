<p class="p">Biological invasions can be conceptualized as a series of consecutive stages – from transport out of the native range to introduction into a new territory, naturalization or establishment of self‐sustaining populations, and spread across the introduced range (e.g. Blackburn

 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The term ‘invasive’ or ‘invader’ is thereby commonly reserved for species that have rapidly spread into multiple sites across a large area. To pass on to the next stage a species has to overcome specific barriers to its survival, establishment and spread. Whether and how fast a species manages to pass these barriers depends on a number of interacting factors that can be grouped into those relating to anthropogenic propagule pressure, physical conditions of the recipient area and biotic traits of the invader itself as well as of the invaded communites (Catford 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). As a result of these consecutive filters, the number of species at each stage diminishes (Williamson &amp; Fitter, 
 <xref rid="geb12512-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), and, even for eventually succesful invaders, extensive time lags may separate first introduction, naturalization and subsequent spread (Essl
