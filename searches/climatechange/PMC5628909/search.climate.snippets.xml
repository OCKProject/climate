  <result pre="the maximum score, lacked concreteness and neglected the issue of" exact="climate" post="change adaptation. Our results underpin those of Kreft et"/>
  <result pre="those of Kreft et al. [ 33]. According to their" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability index applied to German protected areas, most"/>
  <result pre="areas in Germany can be categorised as highly vulnerable against" exact="climate" post="change; none of the sites showed low vulnerability ["/>
  <result pre="it is not individual site characteristics per se that affect" exact="climate" post="change-robustness, but primarily the protected area category. BR and"/>
  <result pre="while NP and Natura 2000 sites are particularly deficient concerning" exact="climate" post="change. Reasons could include the differences in guidelines, requirements"/>
  <result pre="since their definition and legislation inherently provide much better for" exact="climate" post="change-robustness than do NP and Natura 2000 sites. The"/>
  <result pre="large landscape-scale protected areas–also have an appropriate fundament theoretically favouring" exact="climate" post="change-robust management, but many of them exhibit weaker enforcement,"/>
  <result pre="results underline the deficiencies of the Natura 2000 complex regarding" exact="climate" post="change (adaptation) that have been previously identified and discussed"/>
  <result pre="Natura 2000 management planning generally do not develop instructions for" exact="climate" post="change robustness, which is another factor. For instance, the"/>
  <result pre="the German federal state of Brandenburg does not refer to" exact="climate" post="change at all [ 81]. The previous version covered"/>

  <result pre="management planning of the smaller areas tends to be less" exact="climate" post="change-robust than that of larger Natura 2000 sites. This"/>
  <result pre="quite maladaptive as smaller areas are inherently more vulnerable to" exact="climate" post="change and other threats, and thus are areas that"/>
  <result pre="might in fact play an important role with regard to" exact="climate" post="change adaptation efforts [ 29, 74]. For instance, the"/>
  <result pre="document. Since 2007 the BR has engaged very actively in" exact="climate" post="change mitigation and adaptation with several projects, cooperative partnerships"/>
  <result pre="of actual management performance and effectiveness might produce even lower" exact="climate" post="change-robustness scores. In many cases, in Germany, Natura 2000"/>

  <result pre="If management plans constitute a key element of adaptation to" exact="climate" post="change, their quality, functional role, preparation and implementation need"/>
