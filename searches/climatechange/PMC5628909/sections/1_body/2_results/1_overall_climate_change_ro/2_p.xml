<p class="p">We found a strong relationship between the four protected area categories and climate change-robustness, where BR and NLP composed the most robust group with mean climate change-robustness values of 40 and 34 and median values of 41 and 35, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185972.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Nature parks (mean = 18) and Natura 2000 sites (mean = 10) were significantly less robust. Natura 2000 sites were also the smallest protected areas where climate change robustness of their management planning significantly increased with area size (
