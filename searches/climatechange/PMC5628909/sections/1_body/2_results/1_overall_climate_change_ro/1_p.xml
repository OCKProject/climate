<p class="p">The climate change-robustness values of the 60 sites ranged from 2 (2.3% of the maximum score; four sites) to 46 (52.3%; one site), with a median value of 14 and a mean value of 18 (20%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185972.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Two-thirds of the protected areas studied (n = 60) achieved a climate change-robustness index value equal to or lower than 20% of the maximum score. These 40 sites included one NLP, nine NP and 30 Natura 2000 sites; 30 of these management plans had been recently completed (2010â€“2013). 45 plans (75%) reached 50% and less of the score of the best-performing plan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185972.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Less than a third of the plans (16) achieved an index score of more than 25%, of which only two sites scored slightly more than 50% of climate change-robustness.
