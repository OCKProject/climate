<p class="p">Three principles had been strongly reflected by the analysed management plans: 
 <italic class="italic">holistic knowledge management (principle no. 5 as listed in 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0185972.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> â€“P5)
 </italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">public accountability and acceptance (P10)</italic> as well as 
 <italic class="italic">systemic and strategic coherence (P6)</italic>. With more than 80% coverage, their rate of accordance and hence acknowledgement was very high. However, their degree of accordance was rather low, with depth scores between 0.34 and 0.39, and very high scores were only reached in a few management plans. 
 <italic class="italic">Holistic knowledge management (P5)</italic> attained the highest breadth score of all principles (90%). All of its four criteria scored relatively equally; the 
 <italic class="italic">integration of diverse knowledge forms (5</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">2)</italic> prevailed in terms of coverage (breadth 70%) and the consideration of 
 <italic class="italic">different sectors and disciplines (5</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">3)</italic> was most intensely reflected (depth 0.66). The majority of management plans were developed with a more or less intense 
 <italic class="italic">participation of the public (P10)</italic>, or at least an acknowledgement of that principle (73%). In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">informing the public</italic> on climate change 
 <italic class="italic">(10</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">4)</italic> and associated topics were almost hardly addressed (10% coverage). A similar minor heterogeneity between criteria showed the principle of 
 <italic class="italic">systemic and strategic coherence (P6)</italic> where 
 <italic class="italic">inter-protected area management (6</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">4)</italic> was only weakly demonstrated (breadth 20%, depth 0.5) compared to the other three criteria.
