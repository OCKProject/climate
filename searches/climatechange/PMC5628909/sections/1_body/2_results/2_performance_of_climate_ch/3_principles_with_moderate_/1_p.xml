 <italic class="italic">adequate spatial dimension (P3)</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">matrix and stakeholder management (P11)</italic> as well as for managing for 
 <italic class="italic">ecosystem functionality and resilience (P2)</italic>. The principle related to the 
 <italic class="italic">spatial dimension (P3)</italic> of planning and management attained the highest degree of accordance (0.41) of all the principles. Two thirds of the plans approached a

 <italic class="italic">Matrix and stakeholder management (P11)</italic> showed the second strongest heterogeneity between criteria after 
 <italic class="italic">institutional capacity building (P9)</italic>. A high proportion of management plans considered the

 <italic class="italic">stakeholder cooperation</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">11</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">2</italic>; 68%) with comparably high intensity (depth 0.66 and 0.67). However, the

 <italic class="italic">cooperative ecosystem-based climate management (11</italic>.

 <italic class="italic">Ecosystem functionality and resilience (P2)</italic> was represented most by the management for
