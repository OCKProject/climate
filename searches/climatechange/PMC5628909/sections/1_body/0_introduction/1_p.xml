<p class="p">Conservation has long been confronted with the increasing impacts of climate change and the need to adapt to it. Protected areas are considered the cornerstones of conservation strategies and must also adapt to climate change while continuing to conserve biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. On one hand, protected areas are vulnerable to climate change because they are often conceptualised statically, despite the spatially and temporally dynamic nature of their conservation objects (e.g. individual species, communities or ecosystems) [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, they provide an insurance policy for biodiversity as refuges for ecosystem recovery and for preserving systems that are sensitive to disturbance [

Protected areas can also promote the adaptive capacity of ecosystems by providing a buffer against the rate and intensity of environmental change, or providing habitat corridors to facilitate species range- or ecosystem regime- shifts [
