<p class="p">Because of these findings, and to fill the knowledge gap regarding suitable evaluation criteria for climate change adaptation in protected areas, we present principles of climate change-robust management. Our objectives are to guide conservation planning and to provide a framework for assessing the quality and effectiveness of those plans. We define climate change-robustness in protected area management as conservation management that is effective in sustaining the functionality of a protected area despite the myriad of potential impacts associated with climate change. Climate change-robustness heavily builds upon a sturdy fundament of effective management combined with add-ons specifically tailored to tackling climate change. The presented principles hence elaborate on, rather than contradict, existing criteria for evaluating management effectiveness in addressing issues related to climate change. We use our proposed set of principles for climate change-robust conservation management in building an evaluation framework for assessing climate change-robustness of protected area management plans, focussing on a case study in Germany. Further, we analyse the accordance of protected areas and the respective management plans with individual robustness principles. Specifically, we address the following research questions:</p>
