<p class="p">There are different lines of action for conservation, and for protected areas in particular, to face climate change and reduce vulnerability. One is to tackle the vulnerability of conservation targets or biodiversity objects, i.e. reduce the biotic vulnerability [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]). The majority of conservation action associated with this approach depends on the regional or local specifics of the conservation system and its influencing factors. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract generally valid principles. These include reducing threats not related to climate change, ecological restoration, assisted migration or enhancing connectivity, e.g. by the expansion of the reserve network [
