<p class="p">Thus, most recommendations found in the existing literature focus more or less on direct interventions with biodiversity. However, one part of the vulnerability of protected areas is also caused by human interactions within and with the protected area and its human non-human parts [

Nevertheless, options to reduce the vulnerability of conservation management on the levels of planning and implementation procedures are less often considered. A more holistic approach will therefore include all decisions and actions that directly or indirectly influence goal achievement of a conservation site [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Many of those planning and procedural options can be considered climate change-robust (or no-regret) adaptation options [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This means they will strengthen conservation with regard to climate change irrespectively of the exact manifestation of change, or with regard to other environmental or political changes. These robust strategies may also improve the performance and effectiveness of conservation management even if no changes occur [
