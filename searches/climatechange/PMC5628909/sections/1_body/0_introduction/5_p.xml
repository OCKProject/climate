<p class="p">A considerable number of evaluations of protected area management effectiveness in general have been conducted applying various methods, most of which are based on the IUCN Management Effectiveness Framework (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]) but also other approaches [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The contemporary evaluation criteria for protected area management effectiveness [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] consider climate change merely as one out of many factors that need to be considered, for instance as a threat to biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, unlike many other conventional threats, climate change is an overarching multifaceted element affecting all parts of any conservation system unprecedentedly, including other threats and their underlying drivers, [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] as well as the management itself. Therefore, all components of a management system contribute to conservation effectiveness under climate change and need to be tailored specifically to this effect. This has been rarely reflected by research on protected area management. Evaluations of local climate change adaptation plans have been conducted without a specific focus on conservation, for example in the USA [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], in Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], Canada [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and India [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. One recent study in Germany assessed to what degree conservation plans at the county level addressed potential impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In a study on the vulnerability of German protected areas to climate change, Kreft et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] also included, among others, some aspects of conservation management itself. They found that management-related issues were the most significant contributing factor influencing the vulnerability of protected areas to climate change in Germany.
