<p class="p">We developed a protocol for the evaluation of the selected management plans in accordance with sustainability certification where principles and subordinated criteria are used to define sustainable practice (e.g., FSC [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] or RSPO [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]). The evaluation framework for our analysis was based on three types of sources regarding climate change adaptation strategies: 1) fixed standards for holistic, sustainable, and equitable natural resource and conservation management (such as the Ecosystem Approach), 2) scientific publications on options and recommendations for adapting conservation to climate change and 3) experience from project activities on management planning integrating climate change. From these, the most common and most conclusive recommendations were extracted (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0185972.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Finally, we defined eleven principles of climate change-robust conservation management, and identified 44 guiding criteria (four for each principle) to enable assessment (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185972.s002" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). The majority of principles and criteria resemble those of best practice conservation management, with a new and/or stronger significance with regard to climate change. A more detailed description of the principles and their contribution to climate change-robustness of conservation management can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185972.s002" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>. We applied an equal weighting approach to the criteria, which is the standard approach among the plan quality evaluation literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. While this approach neglects potential differences among variables regarding their effects on index results [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], we chose it for its favourable transparency and interpretability in comparison to a weighted-factor approach.
