<p class="p">We selected plans created between 2003 and 2013 that were available online in pdf format. In cases where only short versions were available, we requested full versions from the responsible administration unit. Pre-versions or partially accomplished versions were excluded from the analysis. For BR and NLP we contacted the administrations separately if management plan status could not be determined. To acquire the management plans of the NP and Natura 2000 sites, we contacted several responsible institutions. However, the number of replies was very low, particularly for the latter sites. This resulted in unequal representation among federal states. We tried to choose plans of varying ages for each federal state. In the case of NP we pursued the guideline of one park per federal state as far as the availability and rate of reply allowed.</p>
