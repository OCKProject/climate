<p class="p">The analysis of management plans involved a team of four coders (the leading author and three research assistants), in order to reduce personal bias. The three research assistants were thoroughly introduced to the protocol and instructed in the manner of scoring. In order to ensure scoring consistency, the coders test-coded several trial-plans prior to the evaluation. Based on the tests the protocol was revised and adapted to make it more robust to scoring by different coders. The final protocol was then used to conduct the evaluation of the 60 management plans. Each coder coded a different set of plans individually first, followed by a process of review by the lead author and open discussion among evaluators until a consensus on the scores was reached.</p>
