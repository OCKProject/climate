<p class="p">The degree of accordance of the eleven principles in the management plans was evaluated by scoring the plans against each of the respective four criteria of each principle on a 0â€“2 scale similar to the analytical approaches of previous studies on plan quality (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]). In the present study a score of 0 was given if the criterion was not at all met by the plan or 1 if the criterion was only implicitly acknowledged or partly reflected in the plan without thorough explanation. The highest possible score of 2 was given if the criterion had been fully and comprehensively addressed by the plan. For example, considering criterion 1.1 
 <italic class="italic">Climate change in situation analysis</italic>, a management plan would get a score of 0 if climate change was not mentioned at all in the situation analysis. The plan would receive a score of 1 if it mentioned climate change as a factor influencing conservation objects without further explanation, or if it elaborated on climate change for only a small fraction of the situation analysis while neglecting most parts of it. A score of 2 could be reached if climate change was comprehensively included, elaborating on the impact on biodiversity as well as other factors, such as land use or infrastructure development. The individual scores for each management plan are summarized in
