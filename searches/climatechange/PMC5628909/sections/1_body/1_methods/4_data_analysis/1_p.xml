<p class="p">We analysed the data in three stages. First, we calculated the general climate change-robustness index for each management plan by summing the actual scores of each of the 44 criteria (max. score 88). This index represents the overall performance of the 60 plans against the criteria of the evaluation framework. For an easier assessment, we additionally standardised and normalized the original plan score in percent, and used descriptive statistics to assess overall performance. In the second stage, we tested for statistical significance for the contribution of individual site characteristics of the protected areas to climate change-robustness in “R” [

In the third stage we conducted an item performance analysis on the basis of techniques frequently used in plan quality evaluation studies [

We assessed and compared the performance of the eleven principles and the 44 criteria across all management plans of the sample from three perspectives: their rate of accordance (item breadth score), the quality or degree of their accordance (item depth score) and their total performance (total item score). The three item scores were calculated as follows:
