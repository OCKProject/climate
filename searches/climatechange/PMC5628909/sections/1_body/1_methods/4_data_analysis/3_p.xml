<p class="p">We used the breadth analysis to measure the extent to which each of the principles and criteria was addressed across all management plans, i.e. the proportion of plans that addressed the individual principle or criterion. The score was given on a 0–1 scale for all items. The depth score measures to what extent each individual principle and criterion was addressed by the plans, meaning the level or intensity of accordance for each principle. The depth score for principles reaches a value between 0 and 8 and was standardised to a 0–1 scale (where 0.125 is the lowest achievable value if at least one plan adopted the principle; the value 0 is assigned to principles that were not reflected at all in the plans). With regard to the criteria, the depth score results in a 0–2 scale that was standardised to a 0–1 scale (where the lowest achievable value is 0.5 if at least one plan adopted the criterion, and the value of 0 is reached if none of the plans adopted the criterion). The total item score combines the breadth score and depth score to describe the overall performance of the individual principles and criteria. Finally, we classified principles according to their rate and degree of adoption (i.e. their breadth and depth rates) as indicated in
