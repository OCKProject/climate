<p class="p">The strongest accordance with the principles of climate change-robust conservation management was achieved in terms of

 <italic class="italic">public accountability &amp; acceptance (P10)</italic> as well as 
 <italic class="italic">systemic &amp; strategic coherence (P6)</italic>. We presume that the strength of principles with higher performance partially arises from other discourses and discussions in connection with conservation than that of climate change adaptation. Public participation and acceptance as well as the connectivity of ecosystems are topics that find attention in many other contexts. Nonetheless, they support climate change-robustness of protected areas and should even be more promoted in the light of adapting to climatic or any kind of change. The high performance of the principle of 
 <italic class="italic">holistic knowledge management (P5)</italic> is possibly grounded on the high motivation of administrations in Germany to compile and document knowledge about protected areas, which for many of them–in our experience–is appreciated as the most important planning outcome. Gathering, analysing and discussing knowledge indeed generates new understanding and awareness. However, translation into practical management, i.e. implementation, might turn out to be deficient, making knowledge accumulation of little use. This knowing-doing gap is a common problem in conservation [
