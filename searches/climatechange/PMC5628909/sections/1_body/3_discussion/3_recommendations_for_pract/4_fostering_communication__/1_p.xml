It has been suggested that the establishment of open-access databases of management plans might facilitate collaborative learning, knowledge exchange and communication between conservation actors [

It might benefit evaluation and revision of management plans, for example with regard to the principles of climate change-robustness. Different protected areas might have different competences regarding those principles. Thus, an exchange of knowledge and experiences might be useful to increase the intensity of their adoption. This holds especially for those principles that are already widely acknowledged and mostly lack adequate depth for satisfactory performance. Such cooperation might also make the identification of common barriers easier and facilitate the joint development of overarching solutions.
