<p class="p">In addition, or as an alternative to new climate change-specific guidelines, existing guidelines for protected area management should be revised with regard to climate change adaption. Specific checklists for climate change-robust management need to be compiled, using, for example, the principles presented in this study or similar guidelines elaborated for conservation in Brandenburg, Germany [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Sites protected within the Natura 2000 complex in particular would benefit greatly from such guidelines. This would not only increase climate change-robustness, but also improve management planning in general, which in many cases is currently suffering from substantial deficiencies. Surely, the process of climate change adaptation needs to be tailored to the site and to local needs [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Nevertheless, general guidelines on climate change adaptation and specific principles for climate change-robust management can provide a framework into which protected area managers can fit their site-specific planning and actions.
