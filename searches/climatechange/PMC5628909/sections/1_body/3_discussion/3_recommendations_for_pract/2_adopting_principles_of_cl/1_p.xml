<p class="p">If protected areas shall maintain their functions such as conserving biodiversity in times of (climate) change, their management will have to become more robust against such change. Our evaluation framework provides eleven principles and 44 criteria for climate change-robust conservation management. These principles and criteria are designed to serve as guidance on different planning and management levels. Protected area managers may use these principles in their planning activities, their daily work, for identifying area-specific shortcomings and strengths and thus enhance robustness of the site they are responsible for. Conservation policy might equally be guided by these principles. Drawing on principles and criteria identified as most deficient we consider it acutely necessary</p>
