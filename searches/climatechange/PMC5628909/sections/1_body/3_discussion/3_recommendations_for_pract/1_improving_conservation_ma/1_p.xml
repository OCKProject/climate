<p class="p">Undoubtedly, there is the need for better management plans in conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Besides the quality of plans and their applicability, the process of planning also needs to be improved. It is inevitable to make conservation planning more systematic, strategic, adaptive, iterative and target-oriented. The 
 <italic class="italic">Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</italic> are in use at many conservation sites all over the world and have proven a valuable methodology for strategic adaptive conservation planning. This methodology makes management leaner, easier, more transparent and participatory in terms of both design and implementation [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. MARISCO, an approach derived from the 
 <italic class="italic">Open Standards</italic>, facilitates ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change and embraces risk management. It has been tested in numerous conservation projects all over the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Such management planning instruments address many shortcomings of current conservation management and take up on the presented principles of climate change-robustness. They are applicable on all planning levels regardless their size and organisational structure and represent a promising tool to bridge current planning and communication gaps in conservation planning [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Their standard terminologies typically ensure high comparability between planning levels and different sites and can thus facilitate better coherence in target setting as well as in aligning strategies across different institutional levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Experience has also shown that those approaches are very useful to foster mutual learning. Further, guidelines on management planning, the participation in quality programmes (such as the German nature park quality campaign [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]) and international networks (like the Natura 2000 network or the UNESCO MAB Programme) as well as effectiveness evaluation programmes exert an additional influence on the quality of protected area management and its climate change-robustness. Protected areas would be well advised to comply with such guidelines and programmes and recognise them as chances to make management more (climate change-) robust.
