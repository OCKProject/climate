<p class="p">Future research might apply different weights on individual principles and criteria according to their perceived influence and importance. Our study might provide some indication which principles could get assigned more weight in correspondence to their primary and immediate importance (e.g. addressing climate change, risk management, adaptive management, time dimension, managing for ecosystem functionality and resilience) and which ones might have less direct importance for climate change-robustness (e.g. individual criteria in terms of participation and acceptance, matrix management). In this case the overall climate change-robustness scores would probably even be much lower. Disadvantages of weighting are at least twofold. First, direct comparison of the performance of principles becomes more difficult. Second, unequal weighting means a loss in transparency of the principles and criteria framework.</p>
