<p class="p">One purpose of our study was to assess climate change-robustness of protected area management plans in Germany. Our findings suggest the climate change-robustness of management plans of German protected areas is rather low. The majority of plans scored below 25% of the maximum score, lacked concreteness and neglected the issue of climate change adaptation. Our results underpin those of Kreft et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. According to their climate change vulnerability index applied to German protected areas, most of the 121 assessed protected areas in Germany can be categorised as highly vulnerable against climate change; none of the sites showed low vulnerability [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The only two sites we found scoring above 50% of the possible score showed great differences in their individual site characteristics. One area was a NLP in Bavaria with a prevalence of forests and mountainous terrain; the plan was accomplished by the park administration in 2010. The other area was a BR in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania with an open landscape in the northern plains and a management plan prepared by an external contractor in 2003. Our results indicate that it is not individual site characteristics per se that affect climate change-robustness, but primarily the protected area category. BR and NLP seem to be most robust, while NP and Natura 2000 sites are particularly deficient concerning climate change. Reasons could include the differences in guidelines, requirements and the administration of different protected area categories, but also differently structured competences and resources available.
