<p class="p">The higher robustness performance of BR and NLP is not surprising, since their definition and legislation inherently provide much better for climate change-robustness than do NP and Natura 2000 sites. The underlying concepts of BR and NLP foster greater motivation to meet principles of the Ecosystem Approach. However, the relatively high robustness scores among BR and NLP were still rather low in absolute terms. This should give cause for concern since a large part of the principles and their criteria can be considered best practice conservation, as they have already been adopted in other concepts such as the Ecosystem Approach. Even after one and a half decades, the Ecosystem Approach still appears to remain ‘stuck in the clouds’ [

Similarly, NP per definition–as large landscape-scale protected areas–also have an appropriate fundament theoretically favouring climate change-robust management, but many of them exhibit weaker enforcement, administration and implementation of that definition.
