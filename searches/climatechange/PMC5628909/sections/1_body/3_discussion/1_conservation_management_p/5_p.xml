<p class="p">We found the principles of climate change-robustness were reflected very differently in the plans. This confirms the notion that standards in conservation planning are lacking–which was also concluded from a study on German county-level conservation plans (

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Therefore, existing adaptation guidance is used inconsistently. This does not preclude quality plans, but it certainly increases the risk of failure [
