<p class="p">Our results underline the deficiencies of the Natura 2000 complex regarding climate change (adaptation) that have been previously identified and discussed elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. One important problem is the static conceptualisation of Natura 2000 protection goals, which require a fixed list of annex species and habitats to be conserved on-site [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. In addition, Natura 2000 implementation follows country-specific idiosyncrasies. In the case of Germany, the sheer number of over 5,000 Natura 2000 sites makes it a tantalising effort for the conservation administrations to provide every site with a management plan, even if it was a simple one. The quality of the plans thus has become second priority. The guidelines for Natura 2000 management planning generally do not develop instructions for climate change robustness, which is another factor. For instance, the newest version of the handbook for management planning of sites protected under the Habitats Directive of the EU in the German federal state of Brandenburg does not refer to climate change at all [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The previous version covered this topic in several contexts, although only superficially. It must be concluded that innovations towards climate change-robustness have not only been lacking but even regressing. This is also reflected by our results: most of the younger plans in our sample belong to Natura 2000 sites, which attained lower robustness scores relative to large, national protected areas. This stands in contrast to the intuitive assumption that knowledge increases over time and is in turn incorporated into management guidelines [

 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the most vulnerable conservation sites in Germany (i.e. the Natura 2000 sites as also identified by Kreft et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]) have the least climate change-robust conservation management planning. Moreover, as we have indicated, among the Natura 2000 sites management planning of the smaller areas tends to be less climate change-robust than that of larger Natura 2000 sites. This seems quite maladaptive as smaller areas are inherently more vulnerable to climate change and other threats, and thus are areas that would require a more robust management planning.
