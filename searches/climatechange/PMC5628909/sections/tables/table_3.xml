Further, climate change increases the complexity of conservation and other systems and of their interaction; it generates higher rates of uncertainty. For addressing complexity and uncertainty, a holistic management of knowledge and non-knowledge is necessary. In order to manage a system effectively it is important to know as much about the system as well as about climate change impacts as possible and to use different sources of knowledge. In order to deal with uncertainty it is equally important to keep track of non-knowledge.</td>

Climate change does not only affect conservation target per se but also other systems such as land use systems, which might increase the risk for conservation systems. Proactive risk management acknowledges that anticipatory rather than reactive approaches to conservation are essential when dealing with climate change. It facilitates the preparation for potential changes through anticipation and risk analysis. This enables adapting strategies before changes really affect a system, not only afterwards, and can save costs and ensure effectiveness.</td>

     <td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1" class="td">Climate change poses a particular challenge to conservation managing systems such as protected areas that in many cases tend to have low management effectiveness even without climate change. In order to successfully deal with aspects of climate change in management it is necessary to guarantee a basic functioning of the conservation management system. The acceptance and the support of the public represent preconditions for effectiveness. Resistance, conflicts and counteraction minimizing opportunities to deal with climate change will hamper management. Further, any effort towards climate change adaptation will be ineffective without public support. Protected areas do not function in isolation but within a local and/or regional system. Therefore, conservation under climate change requires an integrative approach that includes all people in and around protected areas, especially land users. They need to be considered an essential part of (conservation) systems.</td>

     <td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1" class="td">Conservation systems are connected with and embedded in other systems such as human (land use or political) systems. Climate change is a global issue and therefore affects all those systems equally. Since most threats and influencing factors on conservation targets occur in the surroundings of conservation sites, those surroundings are important for the connection of individual sites. Therefore, it is essential to pursue an integrative ecosystem management approach to account for (climate) changes in all relevant systems and to support conservation effectiveness. In times of climate change, conservation management is facing the need to consequently and effectively implement strategies that exceed current dimensions and to engage in cooperation with land users and stakeholders much more. It is important to not only acknowledge but also communicate the higher relevance of conservation and climate change to society than traditionally considered.</td>
