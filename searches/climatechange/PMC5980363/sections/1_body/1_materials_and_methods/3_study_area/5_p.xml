<p class="p">The only other wild ungulate species in the study area is the Siberian ibex (
 <italic class="italic">Capra sibirica</italic>). Wild predators include wolf (
 <italic class="italic">Canis lupus</italic>), red fox (
 <italic class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</italic>), brown bear (
 <italic class="italic">Ursus arctos isabellinus</italic>), and snow leopard (
 <italic class="italic">Panthera uncia</italic>). There is limited mining activity at the southern edges of the park, and only one paved road with little traffic, and some unpaved roads in the study area. A barbed wire fence forms a barrier to argali movements with few gaps along the Tajik–Chinese border. Most of the area becomes inaccessible in the winter because of heavy snow accumulation. The majority of the study area outside of the park is assigned to private businesses as hunting concessions. Some of the hunting concession areas are patrolled to minimize illegal hunting, while other areas are unprotected (Valdez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Domestic ungulates include sheep (
 <italic class="italic">Ovis aries</italic>), goat (
 <italic class="italic">Capra hircus</italic>), yak (
 <italic class="italic">Bos grunniens</italic>), and cattle (
 <italic class="italic">Bos Taurus</italic>); domestic sheep are the most numerous followed by yak and few cattle and goats. Domestic animals, except for yak and few herds of sheep and goats, are moved to lower pastures during the fall, winter, and early spring (October–May) because of the harsh winter conditions at higher elevations.
