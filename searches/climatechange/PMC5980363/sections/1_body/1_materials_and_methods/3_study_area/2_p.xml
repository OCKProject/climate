 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) is located in the eastern region of Tajikistan between latitudes 37°N to 40°N and longitudes 72°E to 76°E in the province of Gorno‐Badakhshan, and comprises approximately 41,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. About 93% of Tajikistan is mountainous, and over half of the country is situated above 3,000 m. The terrains in the east of the country form the highest mountain systems in Central Asia, the Pamirs. The Pamir region is known as the “roof of the world” with wide and grassy valley floors, and meandering rivers and streams (Breu &amp; Hurni, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In the study area, elevations in the northern region range from 4,500 to 7,300 m, while those in the southern region range from 3,300 to 5,200 m above mean sea level (Salas, Valdez, &amp; Boykin,
