<p class="p">The methodology was composed of three major steps: (i) processing of argali occurrence dataset and environmental variables, (ii) modeling of current environmental conditions that includes selection of ENMs and evaluation of current conditions, and (iii) modeling of future environmental conditions that includes selection of GCMs, representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and projection of current conditions to future conditions. We modeled argali habitat with two approaches, first using a model consisting of climatic and nonclimatic variables (all environmental variables), and a second model with only climatic variables.</p>
