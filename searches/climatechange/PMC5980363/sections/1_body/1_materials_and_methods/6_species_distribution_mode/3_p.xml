<p class="p">We removed one of each pair of highly correlated (

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) environmental variables to avoid collinearity among predictors (Gama, Crespo, Dolbeth, &amp; Anastácio, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We made the choices between variables based on the results of a species‐specific literature search. In particular, we selected variables that were identified in one or more studies regarding the argali as having an effect on the argali's range or population dynamics. In cases where the results of the literature search could not differentiate between two highly correlated climatic variables, we used a qualitative assessment of the distribution of values of the variable at all presence points and of the relationship between the variable and species presence or pseudo‐absence (Talbert, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We provided an asterisk in Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> to denote the final variables that were selected by our algorithms when modeling the argali habitat.
