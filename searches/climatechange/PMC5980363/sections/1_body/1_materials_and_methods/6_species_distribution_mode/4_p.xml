<p class="p">We produced ensemble maps for the current distributions. The ensemble map is a summation of binary maps generated from probability surfaces from each statistical modeling algorithm (Liu, Berry, Dawson, &amp; Pearson,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We optimized the threshold using specificity = sensitivity in discretizing the probability maps (Manel, Williams, &amp; Ormerod, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The final maps consisted of pixel values that represented the number of models in agreement to indicate that a particular pixel is suitable for argali. A pixel with a value of zero meant that none of the models identified bioclimatic suitability for the species at that location, while a value of 5 meant there was agreement across all five models. We used the current distributions estimated by the ensemble ENMs and projected each to the future.
