<p class="p">Argali occurrences were based on observations from field surveys over multiple years. Using the GPS location of the observers, the distance (measured by range finder or roughly guessed) and azimuth (measured with electromagnetic compass) between observers and observed animals, sightings of argali herds were georeferenced (Michel &amp; Muratov,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Field surveys were conducted in March 2015, July 2015, August 2010, 2011, 2016, September 2013, and December 2009, 2013, 2014. Because clustered point occurrences could introduce potential spatial bias, our algorithm removed multiple presence localities in a grid and analyzed a single occurrence per pixel (Salas, Seamster, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). A total 917 of 976 locations were used in the model. Further, we divided all occurrences into 70%–30% training–testing subsets when running our models.
