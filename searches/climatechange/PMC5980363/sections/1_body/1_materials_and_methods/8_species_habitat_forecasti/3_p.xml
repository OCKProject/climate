<p class="p">Finally, after considering the agreement (overlap) of at least three species distribution models and two GCMs, we compared the current and future ensemble maps to determine areas of stability, gains, and losses in suitable habitat conditions between present day and the two projected years. Suitable habitat is considered stable when present and future ensemble maps agree that the area is suitable for Marco Polo argali. There is gain in suitable habitat when future ensemble projects newly suitable areas beyond the extent of the present suitable map. There is loss of suitable habitat when present ensemble is converted to unsuitable condition in the future.</p>
