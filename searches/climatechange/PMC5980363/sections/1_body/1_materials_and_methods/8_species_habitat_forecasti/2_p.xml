<p class="p">From WorldClim, we derived the eight sets of downscaled future climate projections produced by four GCMs highlighted in the National Climate Change Action (NCCA 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) plan for Tajikistan. The selected GCMs include the following: Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4; Gent et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2‐Earth System (HadGEM2‐ES; Collins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 5 (MIROC5; Watanabe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model (GFDL‐CM3; Donner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). We downloaded raster data for two RCPs (4.5 and 8.5) available for all selected GCMs and for two time periods (year 2050—average for 2041 to 2060 and year 2070—average for 2061 to 2080). RCP 4.5 was selected as it is more or less stable throughout the century among all RCPs in terms of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (Arora et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). For RCP 8.5, it is the most extreme scenario in that it entails the highest projected increase in the concentration of multiple greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (Vuuren, Edmonds, &amp; Kainuma, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and associated increases in global surface temperatures (Knutti &amp; Sedláček, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Results of the current argali distributions were projected to the future using the data from the four GCMs and according to the two RCPs. To avoid generating hundreds of map results, again we used ensembles to produce combination maps for the future distribution of the species. Each RCP result from the four GCMs was combined. In the end, a set of projection maps for the year 2050 and another set for the year 2070 according to each RCP were generated.
