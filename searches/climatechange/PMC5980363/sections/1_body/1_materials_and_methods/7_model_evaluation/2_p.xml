<p class="p">We evaluated confidence in individual model results in terms of concordance among the different distribution models. We had higher confidence that environmental conditions were suitable for a species when three or more (at least 60% of) algorithms were in agreement (e.g., Rehfeldt, Crookston, Sáenz‐Romero, &amp; Campbell, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We compiled information on various measures of model performance, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the test data, correct classification rate (Co%) (Fielding &amp; Bell,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and the true skill statistic (TSS) (Allouche, Tsoar, &amp; Kadmon, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) for each algorithm. The AUC value is the probability that the model would rank a randomly chosen presence observation higher than the randomly chosen absence observation. Swets (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) classified values of AUC as follows: those &gt;0.9 indicated high accuracy (excellent), from 0.7 to 0.9 indicated good accuracy, and those &lt;0.7 indicated low accuracy. The TSS, a threshold‐dependent statistics, is presented as an improved measure of model accuracy that, unlike the common kappa statistics (Allouche et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Cohen, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1960</xref>), is not dependent on species prevalence (i.e., proportion of occurrence points for which the species is present). Acceptable models are those with at least a TSS of 0.5, and excellent those with TSS around 0.7. We checked other qualitative assessments of model performance, which included the inspection of calibration and deviance of residual plots. Calibration plots indicate whether models tend to over or underpredict habitat suitability. Deviance of residual plots is used to identify individual data points that may require further inspection or whether there may be an important environmental layer missing from the model inputs (Morisette et al.,
