<p class="p">To build the models, we used 26 environmental variables (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), of which 19 were bioclimatic variables from WorldClim datasets (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and the rest were habitat and topographic variables that were previously identified as preferable for argali habitat (Salas, Valdez, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). WorldClim provides climate projections statistically downscaled using a “delta method” approach to a spatial resolution of 30 arc‐sec, roughly 900 m at the equator. All raster images were resampled to the spatial resolution of the WorldClim data. We derived the green vegetation cover and sparse vegetation cover from the Global Land Cover 2000 project (Tateishi, Zhu, &amp; Sato, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) and used them to represent forage abundance. Previous studies considered vegetation distribution as an important predictor in modeling the argali habitat (Salas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). For escape terrain, we created a continuous distance around polygon patches with slopes ≥ 30° (Smith, Flinders, &amp; Winn, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Turner, Douglas, Hallum, Krausman, &amp; Ramey, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). The processed DEM with a 1 arc‐second, or about 30 m (98 feet) resolution was sourced from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation dataset that is available for download online (USGS 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We computed the slope and the aspect from the DEM. To further capture the relief characteristics of the landscape terrain, the terrain ruggedness index (TRI) was calculated from the DEM based on Sappington, Longshore, and Thomson (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Turner et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) showed that TRI could be a better predictor than proximity to escape terrain when both are used in the same modeling set. The TRI shows the average change in elevation between a center pixel and its eight neighboring pixels in a 3‐by‐3 window. All candidate variables were clipped to the extent of the study area.
