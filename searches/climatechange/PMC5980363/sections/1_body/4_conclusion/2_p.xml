<p class="p">The main contribution of this study is the quantification of the possible impact of climate change regimes on the availability of future suitable habitats for Marco Polo argali. Results in all our models showed major losses of suitable habitat for the populations of argali in eastern Tajikistan. While our results are potential projections of future Marco Polo argali suitable habitat, this is the first quantitative assessment of habitat shifts of argali under future climate change in eastern Tajikistan, which could provide information for conservation planning for this near threatened species in the region. There is a need to conduct a similar study to include habitats in adjacent populations in Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan and to determine the extent of changes in critical habitats in climate scenarios.</p>
