<p class="p">Using all variables, the five ENMs showed similar patterns of potential suitable conditions for argali in the northern and southeastern regions of the study area (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Visual assessment of the maps revealed some differences, however. The five statistical models projected differing size of suitable areas even though they were using the same dataset of occurrence points. Among the five models, only RF and BRT (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a and e) identified potential suitable conditions in locations where presence points were mostly concentrated. These two suitability maps are associated with fairly high AUC values in Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> for RF (0.89) and BRT (0.94). GLM, MARS, and Maxent (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b, c, and d) highlighted suitable conditions in the western part of the study area, although MARS accentuated the suitable environmental conditions in the extreme eastern portion. The area of the current potential distribution of the argali, considering climatic and nonclimatic variables and based on the agreement of at least three ENMs, is 11,432 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Using climatic variables only, more locations were identified as potential suitable conditions for argali in all five models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) compared to models that included the nonclimatic variables. The area of the current potential distribution of the argali, considering climatic variables only and based on the agreement of at least three ENMs, encompasses 13,242 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Similar to the results in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, only RF and BRT (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a and e) identified potential suitable conditions in locations where presence points were mostly concentrated.
