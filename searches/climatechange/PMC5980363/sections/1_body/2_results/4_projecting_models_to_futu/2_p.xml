<p class="p">Effects of climate change for present suitable areas for argali are shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. These are maps of projected scenarios generated through comparison of ensembles of suitable conditions between present and projected future climatic conditions. These maps show areas where ensembles agree between present and future (stable), future ensemble projections of new suitable conditions (gain), and where present suitable ensemble projections may be converted to unsuitable conditions in the future (loss), and areas where conditions are unsuitable now and in the future (non). According to our projections for models using all environmental predictors, gains were observed even for the worst climate scenario—RCP 8.5 projected to year 2070 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d). The average gains for 2050 and 2070 projections (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) were more than doubled the present suitable habitat (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Gains were also observed for models with climatic variables only (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The total area containing suitable conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a–d) increased from present to projected future, with an average gain of 46.3% by 2050 and 46.0% average gain by 2070 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>).
