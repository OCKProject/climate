<p class="p">While gains were observed in new locations, the current areas of suitable habitat for the argali were projected to decline in 2050 and 2070 under all RCP scenarios (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34103-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Majority of the losses were observed in the lower elevation (3,300 to 4,300 m) in the southeastern region of the study area where occurrence points were mostly concentrated. Models with climate variables predicted that 63.0% (8,347 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and 65.6% (8,683 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of present suitable argali habitat would be lost by 2050 and 2070, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Models that considered all environmental variables also predicted losses of 60.6% (6,928 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and 63.2% (7,219 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) by 2050 and 2070, respectively. Fortunately, we observed current suitable areas located in higher elevations in the northern region (4,500–6,900 m) would continue to persist with future climate change. Also, we observed more habitat gains at much higher elevation in the study area, showing that elevational shift of habitat use could occur in the future. Total gains observed for models with all environmental variables were 118% (13,485 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for 2050 scenario and 116.8% (13,356 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for 2070 scenario.
