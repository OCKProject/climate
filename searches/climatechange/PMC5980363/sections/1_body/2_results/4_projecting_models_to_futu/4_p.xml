<p class="p">In terms of habitat stability, the percentages of areas that would remain suitable for argali in 2050 and 2070 were a little higher for scenarios using climatic variables only than with scenarios using all environmental variables. For instance, 37.0% (4,895 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of current suitable areas would remain suitable in 2050 for models with climatic variables only, while those models that considered all predictors showed 39.4% (4,504 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The same could be deduced for projection results for 2070: 34.4% (4,559 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) (climatic variables) and 36.9% (4,212 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) (all variables).
