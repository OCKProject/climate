<p class="p">The AUC values for all models were above 0.80 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34103-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Statistics for models with climate variables only are enclosed in parenthesis. BRT was the strongest with AUC = 0.94 (AUC = 0.93) followed by RF with 0.89 (0.86), Maxent with 0.86 (0.84), GLM with 0.84 (0.81), and MARS with 0.82 (0.81). BRT also had the highest values for TSS (0.73 and 0.70) and %Co (86.4 and 84.4). Results on the variable importance for models with both climatic and nonclimatic variables showed that the annual mean temperature (bioclim 1), precipitation of warmest quarter (bioclim 18), and temperature seasonality (bioclim 4) were identified as the three most relevant climatic variables for predicting habitat suitability and distribution of argali in all five models. The terrain ruggedness was also considered an important predictor, placing it in the top five among variable inputs. The TRI was the highest‐ranked nonclimatic variable. Other nonclimatic variables of importance included the vegetation cover, proximity to riparian areas, and aspect.
