<p class="p">Argalis (
 <italic class="italic">Ovis ammon</italic>) are wild sheep restricted to Asia in Afghanistan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (Valdez &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Marco Polo argali (
 <italic class="italic">O. a. polii</italic>) occurs in eastern Tajikistan and adjacent areas of surrounding countries: China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan. They are highly desired big‐game trophies because of their long horns of up to 191 cm (75 in). Argalis are listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service throughout their range, except in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Mongolia where they are designated as threatened. They are listed in CITES Appendix II and as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. Argali have declined in numbers and distribution during the last century (Harris &amp; Reading, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Valdez &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Eastern Tajikistan has greater numbers of argali than any other country with a minimum of 24,000 in the Pamir region (Michel &amp; Muratov, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Valdez, Michel, Subbotin, &amp; Klich, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Due to the high elevation of the Pamirs, the region is extremely susceptible to climate‐driven threats, such as glacier recession (Khromova, Osipova, Tsvetkov, Dyurgerov, &amp; Barry, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and decrease in water storage and supply (Finaev, Liu, Bao, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) that could harmfully impact wildlife habitats (BIOFOR 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Glaciers play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle of high‐altitude regions (Nogués‐Bravo, Araujo, Errea, &amp; Martinez‐Rica, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) as they, together with snow packs, provide freshwater and soil moisture necessary for the survival of vegetation communities. Because argali sheep sightings occur nearest to water sources where available forage is abundant (Salas, Boykin, &amp; Valdez, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and riparian habitats have been shown to be the strongest predictors for argali occurrence in Tibet (Singh, Yoccoz, Bhatnagar, &amp; Fox, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and in the Pamirs of Tajikistan (Salas, Valdez, &amp; Michel, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), increased temperatures in mountainous regions could decrease forage availability in proximity to riparian areas and hence the amount of suitable habitat for argali. IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) reported that retreat of various large glaciers could accelerate through the 21st century, which would initially increase summer flow but, in the long term, could reduce water availability in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges in Central Asia. This increased water scarcity could cause extensive habitat loss and degradation of mountain ecosystems (Breu &amp; Hurni, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>).
