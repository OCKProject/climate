<p class="p">This is the first modeling study in Tajikistan to assess the impacts of climate change on argali habitat and the first quantitative study of factors driving climatic distribution patterns of argali. This study is directed toward filling this knowledge gap by combining statistical models with field sightings of argali collected in eastern Tajikistan. Our objective is threefold: to develop models of present‚Äêday and potential future distributions of suitable environmental conditions for argali in mountainous regions in eastern Tajikistan, to compare how climate change impacts the future availability of habitat for argali, and to provide information of the diverse climatic and nonclimatic variables that could potentially affect argali habitat. Lastly, we hypothesized that there would be elevational habitat shifting of argali under future climate conditions when projected to years 2050 and 2070.</p>
