<p class="p">The effects of climate change are already being detected in the shifting and contraction of species’ ranges (Raxworthy,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), and suboptimal movement behavior patterns (van Beest &amp; Milner, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This change could be deleterious (Lannoo, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), leading to reduction in species abundance as habitats deteriorate (Halpin, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). When global temperatures exceed 2.5°C, there could be negative consequences for biodiversity especially in montane habitats, where extensive species losses (up to 60% under high emission scenario by 2080) could occur (IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Further, the reduction in glacier thickness would have detrimental effects on many organisms, specifically on mammals and large predators (Haynes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In Tajikistan, the fauna of high mountain regions are the most sensitive to climate change (NCCA 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), and could result in declines of rare and at‐risk species, such as argali. Our models indicated that climate change would have significant negative impacts on argali habitat in eastern Tajikistan.
