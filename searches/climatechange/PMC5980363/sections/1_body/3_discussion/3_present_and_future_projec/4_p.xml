<p class="p">Although our future models detected retention of suitable habitat in parts of the northern region, we still observed a shift of the species distribution northward (latitudinal) and possibly to higher elevations propelled by climate change, as the southern region experienced a major decline of suitable habitat. Previous research showed the spatial response to climate change for a variety of species—shifting distributions northward and upward (Alvarez, Salas, Harings, &amp; Boykin,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) that detected no elevational shift of Tibetan ungulates, our model projected a future altitudinal change of suitable areas from lower to higher elevations in the northern region of the study area where the highest elevations occur. An elevational shift of forage productivity to higher latitudes (Singh, Grachev, Bekenov, &amp; Milner‐Gulland, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) could result in altitudinal shifting of argali in response to climate change.
