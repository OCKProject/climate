<p class="p">This is the first study to model climate change and map the current and future habitat suitability of argali in Tajikistan (and in Asia). This is also the first study to use an ensemble of modeling algorithms and climate models for a large mammal species endemic to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. We modeled the argali suitable habitats under current and future climates using two datasets, one with only climatic variables and another set that included other environmental variables. Models of present conditions were controlled by annual mean temperature, suggesting that this important climatic variable was a major limiting factor for argali. The association of argali to low temperatures was also reported in Khan et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), where it was labeled a major factor influencing species distribution and habitat suitability for ungulates in the Karakoram‐Pamir Landscape between China and Pakistan
 <bold class="bold">.</bold> Other studies also acknowledged the importance of temperature in modeling ungulates habitat suitability (Aryal, Raubenheimer, &amp; Brunton, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Forrest et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), although some used elevation as a substitute for temperature (Aryal, Brunton, Ji, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Apart from the annual mean temperature, we expected the precipitation data in the warmest quarter to rank high in the models, which our results confirmed. Other modeling studies for argali such Khan et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) did not include precipitation in the warmest quarter as a predictor. Abundant precipitation in dry months is key to moist meadows and forage development. St‐Louis and Côté (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that forage quality can be a key factor determining habitat selection patterns for large herbivores. Likewise, the vegetation cover was found by our models to be an important contributor to the predicted habitat of Marco Polo argali. Salas et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that the availability of forage and the distribution of argali are strongly correlated. Previous studies also reported cases where the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Guyot &amp; Gu, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), used as an index of forage abundance (NDVI &gt; 0.4) (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), was linked to the distribution of large herbivores (Pettorelli, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The slope and elevation did not rank high on importance unlike previous studies showing them as major limiting factors for ungulates (Aryal, Brunton, Ji, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Forrest et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, terrain roughness was a significant predictor of habitat probably because the variable is, in part, defined by slope. Suitable areas for argali were found primarily on gentler slopes (0° to 15°), as also observed by Singh et al. (
