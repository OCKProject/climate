<p class="p">While there were differences in results among models, all future projections showed similar spatial patterns of habitat losses in 2050 and 2070, driven by climatic factors. The significant reduction in the present‐day distribution of suitable conditions for the argali would potentially occur at lower elevations in the southeastern Pamirs. The massive habitat loss could be attributed to the decrease in precipitation projected specifically for the lower elevation areas of southeastern Tajikistan (SHCOEP

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) has documented the effects of climate change in the Tajikistan Pamirs with continuing glaciers degradation. In contrast, in the northern part of the study area where relatively high elevations occur, suitable habitats are projected to remain stable. On average, Marco Polo argali could lose more than two‐thirds of their present suitable habitat by 2070. Our results predicted higher estimates of loss than those ungulate studies conducted in other mountainous regions. For example, Luo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) predicted more than half of the current suitable areas for the Tibetan ungulates would be lost by 2080 due to climate change. This difference in estimates could be because the Tibetan Plateau, compared to other mountain systems, is retreating at an accelerating rate due to global warming (IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change),
