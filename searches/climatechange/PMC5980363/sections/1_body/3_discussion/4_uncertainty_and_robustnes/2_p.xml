<p class="p">Three have been objections by a handful of studies about the use of climatic variables alone to model the climate envelope of species (Geyer, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sax, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) because there are a wide range of climate change‐related stresses that are at play that could affect population ecology and physiology. Climatic variables alone may not always correctly ascertain current or future species distribution over space (Salas, Seamster, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Despite the limitations of models using climatic variables solely, several proponents have praised their crucial role to provide broad insights on the future effects of climate change on species distribution (Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Soberón, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Although complete assessment of the effects of climate change on argali includes other indirect variables such herders’ presence and general human presence (Panthi, Khanal, Acharya, Aryal, &amp; Srivathsa, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Shrestha et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) (including poaching pressure) or predicted paved roads and villages, they are not often utilized when projecting to future distributions. Also, a study by Bucklin et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) using 14 vertebrate species found that climate variables were more critical in ENMs than other environmental predictors. Our models used nonclimatic dataset that were found to optimize model performance and ecological applicability. However, variables that would have added value to the current study, such as species life history, dispersal capacity, and the complex ecological interrelationships among species (Soberón, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), were not integrated into the modeling process due to data unavailability. Furthermore, when we projected present conditions to future years, we assumed that the land cover and other topographic factors in the region would remain stable in the future. These shortcomings of our models could result to spatial mismatch between the projected future and real distributions of argali habitats. Results of our study may not deliver the most accurate predicted distributions; however, they could still facilitate in Marco Polo argali conservation planning in the region and provide approximation of changes of species distribution in the context of climate change.
