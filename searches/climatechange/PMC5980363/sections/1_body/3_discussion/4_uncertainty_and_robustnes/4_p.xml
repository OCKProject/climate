<p class="p">Variability of results makes assessment of projections of future conditions a complex effort. First, it is not possible to determine which single ENM could provide the most accurate information for a species, although one could argue that the climate model with the highest accuracy in capturing the present‚Äêday suitable habitat conditions may produce more accurate future projections. However, Thuiller (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) reasoned that even when a model has the highest AUC and K statistics, the model may not provide the best estimate of the future distribution of suitable conditions, especially as every model is based on different assumptions. It is most fitting to use an ensemble model of future projections, as this ensemble represents the areas of agreement among individual model projections. The reliability of future conditions produced by ensembles may be questioned, but ensemble results do incorporate the positive aspects of multiple models and provide a more conservative assessment of these conditions.
