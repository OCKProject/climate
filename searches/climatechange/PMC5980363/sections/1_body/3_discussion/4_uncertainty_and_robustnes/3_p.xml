<p class="p">In terms of our modeling techniques, multiple limitations associated with the projection of species distributions into the future under different climate scenarios have been documented. Three broad categories of uncertainties affecting the climate variables used to drive the ENMs include (a) uncertainties in future greenhouse gas concentrations (Meinshausen, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), (b) limitations in the accuracy of GCM‐simulated, large‐scale physical climate responses to changing greenhouse gas levels (Knutti &amp; Sedláček, 
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and (c) shortcomings and assumptions inherent to statistical downscaling methods used to refine GCM results to a finer level of spatial detail (Barsugli,

 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). By utilizing data products derived from four GCMs and two RCPs, this study partially explores two of these three sources of climate variable uncertainty. Stoklosa, Daly, Foster, Ashcroft, and Warton (
 <xref rid="ece34103-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) specifically discuss approaches to account for some uncertainties in the climate variables used to drive ENMs. Furthermore, several authors have shown variability among future projections of suitable climatic conditions when using different climate models applied to the same species occurrence dataset (Bakkenes, Alkemade, &amp; Ihle,
