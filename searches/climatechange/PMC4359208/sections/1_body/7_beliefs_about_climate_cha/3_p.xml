<p class="p">Findings on the relationships between these varied dimensions of belief and support for action have been mixed. 
 <xref rid="bibr17-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietz et al. (2007)</xref> found no relationship between exposure to sources of information or self-rated knowledge about climate change and support for climate change policy. 
 <xref rid="bibr57-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Connor et al. (1999)</xref> found belief that global average temperature would rise over the next 50 years and knowledge of the causes of “global warming” to be positive predictors of policy support. On the other hand, 
 <xref rid="bibr58-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Connor et al. (2002)</xref> found no associations between belief in temperature rise and policy support or expressed likelihood of engaging in voluntary GHG-reducing behaviors, but did find positive relationships between understanding of causes and both of those variables. 
 <xref rid="bibr78-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zahran et al. (2006)</xref> found a correlation between climate change policy support and knowledge about GHGs. 
 <xref rid="bibr12-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brody et al. (2012)</xref>, on the other hand, detected no relationship between their larger set of climate knowledge/causes scale and willingness to adopt climate change mitigation behavior. Such studies have provided valuable insight into the role that different dimensions of climate change beliefs may play in shaping responses to climate change. However, variability in the measures used has made synthetic interpretation of results difficult.
