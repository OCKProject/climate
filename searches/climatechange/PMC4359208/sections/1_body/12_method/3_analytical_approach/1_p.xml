<p class="p">We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the studyâ€™s hypotheses. Structural equation models are a versatile class of models for characterizing multivariate relationships. The general SEM combines factor analysis and regression models to allow structural relationships among latent variables (
 <xref rid="bibr10-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bollen, 1989</xref>). We construct two multivariate models that draw on SEM techniques. Specifically, these models contain relationships among latent variables that represent trust in agricultural and environmental interests, belief in and attribution of climate change, perceived climate risks, and support for action. Model 1 investigates support for adaptive action, and Model 2 investigates support for mitigative action.
