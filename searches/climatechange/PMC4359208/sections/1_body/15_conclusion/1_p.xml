<p class="p">The consensus view among scientists is that to maintain long-term societal food security, we urgently need to reduce agricultureâ€™s vulnerability to predicted changes in climate and reduce GHG emissions (e.g.,

The results of this study show that Iowa farmers, in general, seem to be willing to adapt to changing climate conditions and view their responses as risk management strategies to maintain crop productivity. However, perceptions of mitigation activities by government are less straightforward. Farmers who believe that climate change is happening and primarily anthropogenic are more likely to favor government action on GHGs, yet they represent a small fraction of the farmers in our sample. Moreover, more than half did not believe that climate change is occurring, were uncertain about its existence, or believed that it is primarily due to natural causes.
