<p class="p">Literature on adaptation and mitigation of natural hazards finds that behavioral responses to hazards depend in large part on risk perception, or “beliefs about the existence and characteristics of a natural hazard” (

In other words, behavior change is influenced by perceptions of the risks associated with a given natural hazard, which are mediated by beliefs about (1) the existence of the hazard and (2) its characteristics. Perceived risk among individuals or collectivities, while a critical determinant of willingness to prepare for or mitigate natural hazards, is often at odds with objective assessments of risk (

Because perceptions of risk are socially constructed and transmitted, differences in worldviews, personal experiences, expectations about technology, trust in institutions, and other factors can influence awareness and understanding of hazards and decisions and actions (or inaction) in response (
