<p class="p">Other recent maps that focus specifically on areas in Africa suitable for epidemic (episodic) malaria (Grover-Kopec et al.

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) as a step in a larger modeling process indicates that all of Africa could potentially be suitable for the malaria parasite (see Fig. 6.6 in Guerra 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), in line with our “marginally suitable” or largest range limit. Our model also broadly corroborates predictions of current and future

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Because each malaria or vector mapping project discussed used slightly different criteria, we cannot expect these maps to correspond exactly. Other approaches, such as those that rely on empirical transmission data, could inadequately capture conditions that influence transmission in areas with human populations that are too small to sustain malaria or where data collection effort is too low to capture intermittent transmission. The challenges in understanding why each approach results in different predicted patterns highlight the need to make the mapping process more transparent across studies so they can be compared more directly (Johnson et al. 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
