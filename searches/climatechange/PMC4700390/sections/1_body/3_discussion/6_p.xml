<p class="p">Our maps suggest that projected climate change could lead to a large decrease in the population at highest risk for malaria transmission. Future shifts in population density will affect the distribution of people living where temperatures are suitable for malaria transmission, and this distribution might also respond directly to changes in climate or malaria transmission. However, we emphasize that the Mordecai et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) model predicts that optimum transmission temperatures are cooler than in previous models. Given the predicted geographic shifts of these moderate temperatures, it is likely that the optimal transmission temperature and high population density will continue to coincide. Finally, our predicted transmission suitability under climate change is limited to the predictive quality of the climate model we use; understanding the importance of assumptions underlying climate change scenarios would require repeating the analyses described here under different climate regimes.
