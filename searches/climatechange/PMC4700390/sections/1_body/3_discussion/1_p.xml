<p class="p">Maps based on a model with realistic assumptions about thermal physiology of anopheline mosquitoes made novel predictions about the relationship between climate change and malaria transmission suitability. Specifically, temperatures across a large area of Africa are currently more suitable for malaria transmission than previously estimated. Because this revised optimal temperature (25Â°C) is much closer to current temperature conditions across much of Africa, future warming may reduce transmission suitability in regions where transmission is currently high. Still, temperatures across large parts of the continent will become more suitable for transmission overall under future climate scenarios, and the areas where low temperature completely prevents malaria transmission will contract. These contrasting patterns arise from the unimodal relationship between malaria transmission and temperature.</p>
