<p class="p">We still need a better understanding of the behavior and physiology of local mosquito and parasite populations and their climate space. One thermal performance curve cannot capture the full breadth of thermal response behavior of all mosquito and parasite populations across Africa. Ectothermic populations differ in their responses to temperature within species, due to adaptation of local populations to prevailing local conditions (Angilletta et al. 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), which may affect their capability to cope with climatic change (Sternberg and Thomas 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, the actual temperatures that vectors and parasites experience can differ considerably from standard weather station data (Cator et al. 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), in part because mosquitoes can thermoregulate behaviorally (Blanford et al. 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) and avoid extreme temperatures (Kirby and Lindsay 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Temperature variation (
 <italic class="italic">e.g</italic>., daily temperature variation) may also be important for making more accurate local predictions, but we do not expect it to affect our general predictions for relative suitability. While daily fluctuations have been shown to affect mosquito and parasite development (Paaijmans et al. 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), this occurs mostly at the tails (upper and lower boundaries) of the range. Blanford et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found that these temperature variations averaged over a month performed just as well as daily fluctuations for estimating biological rates. Nonetheless, local studies on mosquito physiology and behavior, combined with microclimatic measurements, will allow us to determine how climate, climate variability, and climate extremes eventually affect disease transmission at a finer scale (Altizer et al. 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
