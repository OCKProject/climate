<p class="p">Our seasonal duration model of the most suitable transmission quantile was visually similar to the MARA map (MARA/ARMA, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). In contrast, our 100% range map of suitability predicts a much larger area of 12-month suitability, because it captures all areas where malaria transmission is not excluded for a full 12 months. Our map predictions differ from the MARA map in several regions, specifically in the Horn of Africa and in southern Africa; we find suitability where it is not predicted by MARA. These differences almost certainly reflect factors other than temperature, including different assumptions about humidity. In the MARA model specifications, full suitability in southern Africa (
