<p class="p">We note that the timescale at which climate change may affect the distribution of suitability does not necessarily match that of health intervention planning. However, this suitability map can inform current allocation of intervention under current climate conditions by highlighting areas that perhaps were not previously identified as seasonally suitable or by distinguishing endemic suitability and epidemic suitability. Given that the types of intervention and control differ in these contrasting scenarios, and that resistance can emerge in more episodic areas, we think this map is of value to planning. Most importantly, with accurate suitability predictions and appropriate planning for potential geographic shifts in risk, an increase in transmission suitability does not have to increase malaria cases.</p>
