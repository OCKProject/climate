<p class="p">On the basis of the Mordecai et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) model, we mapped malaria temperature suitability, seasonality, and transmission duration under current and predicted future climate scenarios, incorporating restrictions on moisture availability. We then combined these with human population density estimates to emphasize changes in the relative risk of changing temperatures to human populations living in areas suitable for malaria transmission. We did not measure absolute transmission risk because other factors, including socioeconomic conditions, urbanization, and control measures, affect the realized transmission rate (Gething et al. 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). We mapped the relative intensity of conditions for transmission, because when conditions are highly suitable for transmission, transmission rate may not strongly correlate with prevalence (Beier et al. 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) but will likely be mediated by human exposure behavior.
