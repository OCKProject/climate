<p class="p">These differences in temperature limits should alter predicted spatial patterns of malaria transmissibility as the climate changes. More specifically, this model alters predictions of where climate both promotes and prevents transmission (Lafferty

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Process-based models generate suitability predictions that are independent of observed prevalence data (rather than fitted to it) and not confounded by control efforts or socioeconomic factors. Thus, this model provides a baseline prediction for the impacts of temperature in determining large-scale patterns of malaria transmissibility, to which more local effects (
