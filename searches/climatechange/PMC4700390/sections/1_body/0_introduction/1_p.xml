 <sc class="sc">alaria causes an estimated</sc> 584,000 deaths a year, mostly due to

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>, Parham et al. 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref> and references therein). Many factors impact malaria burden, including climate, land use, socioeconomic conditions, and intervention efforts (Johnson et al. 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In particular, the temperature sensitivity of mosquitoes and parasites limits the transmission potential in a given location, and temperature has been shown to be an important predictor of malaria incidence in many areas (Pascual et al. 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Because insect and parasite physiology constrain malaria transmission to temperatures between 17°C and 34°C (Mordecai et al. 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), temperature places limits on the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria transmission. Climate-induced shifts in distribution will impact the efficacy of intervention and vector control efforts (Siraj et al. 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). As a result, accurately modeling how temperature limits transmission is essential to our understanding of the current and future distribution of malaria on the landscape (Snow et al. 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>).
