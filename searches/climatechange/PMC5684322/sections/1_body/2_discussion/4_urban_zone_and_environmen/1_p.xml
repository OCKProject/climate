<p id="Par15" class="p">As reported above, environmental changes since the 1960s resulted in consistent growth acceleration of urban and rural trees throughout the investigated climate zones. This occurrence in three of the four climate zones does not change the previous ranking of the urban zones (urban vs. rural) in terms of growth velocity. The results were only different for the subtropical zone, where rural trees showed enormous growth acceleration in contrast to urban trees, where only a minor increase was observed. Overall, the combine trend was a non-relevant difference in urban vs. rural growth rates since the 1960.</p>
