<p id="Par16" class="p">If the urban environment can be considered a preview of future climate conditions for nearby rural areas (e.g. warmer and drier), our results suggest that rural trees in subtropical regions will be the first of the non-urban areas to encounter conditions were tree growth rates will decline due to climate change. While such a pattern was not detected for the other investigated climate zones, urban tree growth may very well develop in different directions depending on the various combination of the key causal effects (temperature, water supply, growing season length, CO
