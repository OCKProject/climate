However, in the temperate and in the subtropical zone, urban compared to rural tree growth has profited less from the changes in recent decades. This might be seen as a sign that the formerly beneficial urban climate may turn into disadvantageous dry conditions that reduce growth, especially in water-limited climate zones such as subtropics.</p>
