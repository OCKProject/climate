<p id="Par20" class="p">The shown acceleration of tree size growth means increased C sequestration, accelerated spatial above- and below-ground expansion, and earlier provision of many ecosystem services. However, it also means more rapid tree aging, possibly indicating a need for earlier replacement and replanting. In order to sustain the green urban infrastructure, planning and management should adapt to this changing tree growth rate. Whether the accelerated tree growth lowers the mechanical stability, biotic resistance, or safety hazard of urban trees is a topic of ongoing research based on the worldwide network of urban trees established within this study.</p>
