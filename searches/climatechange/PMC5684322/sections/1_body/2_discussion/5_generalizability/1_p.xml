<p id="Par18" class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first study providing an international synopsis about the effects of global climate change and the urban zone on tree growth in cities. As it was obviously impossible to sample the same tree species in all metropolises, one might argue that cross-city analyses were not meaningful due to a lack of comparability. However, given the goals of our study, having a distinct species at each location that is, as indicated by its frequent occurrence, well adapted to past long-term local conditions is both the most realistic and the most preferable option. In this way, the relevance of our results for management is secure and we can safely use past growth of well-adapted trees as a reference. Against this backdrop, it was important to prevent species-specific scaling characteristics from introducing bias into the results reported above. This was achieved by including city-/species-specific random effects on both generic parameters of the relationship between tree age and basal area in all regression models which formed the statistical backbone of our analysis (see EquationsÂ
