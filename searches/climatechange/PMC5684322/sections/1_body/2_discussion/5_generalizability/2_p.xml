<p id="Par19" class="p">As this study focuses on the growth of trees, visibly damaged or diseased individuals were excluded from sampling. Thus, our results do not allow statements e.g. about the potentially differing risks of diseases or premature death faced by urban and rural trees. With this work we emphasize the potential of urban trees for bio-monitoring, especially in retrospect. Using tree ring patterns as a source of information about environmental changes we can show the vast footprint of humans on urban tree growth. Both global climate change and the urban heat island effect are reflected in the tree ring patterns. Together these effects accelerate tree growth by an average of 35%, consisting of a global climate change effect of 21% and an urban heat island effect of 14%. We sampled tree species which are i) growing in their optimum in the respective climate zones ii) commonly established in urban areas, and iii) well adapted to the respective (past) climate. Other species which are less adapted may benefit less from the changing climate or suffer more from future developments in the global and urban climates. But interestingly, although the sampled tree species differ in their general traits (e.g. shade or drought tolerance, hydric behavior) an overarching trend in growth shift was observed.</p>
