<p id="Par14" class="p">However, we did not only observe such superior growth of urban zone trees. Under a Mediterranean climate we found no significant difference between urban and rural tree growth, neither before, nor after 1960. And in contrast to other regions, temperate zone, urban zone trees grew significantly less than rural ones, both before and after 1960. While adverse and beneficial effects of rural and urban zones seem to cancel out under Mediterranean conditions, the adverse urban zone effects seem to constrain tree growth in temperate climate cities. Urban trees can suffer from substantial water stress due to high temperatures, modified precipitation patterns, and unfavorable soil conditions due to impervious surfaces and compacted soils in urban areas

 </sup>, these effects may reduce root growth and in turn hamper a treeâ€™s water uptake. We assume that the trend towards a declining difference in growth rates between urban and rural trees with increasing age is closely linked to limited water supply of bigger trees. The higher potential water consumption of old (big) trees compared to young (small) ones cannot be fulfilled under urban conditions and this results in reduced tree growth.
