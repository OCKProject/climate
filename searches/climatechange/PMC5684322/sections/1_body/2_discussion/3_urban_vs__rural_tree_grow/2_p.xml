<p id="Par13" class="p">The higher growth rates of urban trees (as compared to rural trees) seem to be closely related to the urban climate which is characterized by the urban heat island effect, leading to an increase of the daytime surface and air temperature of sealed city centers by up to 3 and 10 °C, respectively

Because of the high precipitation in these climates and thus non-limited water supply for the trees, the above-mentioned influences of increased temperature and longer growing seasons, higher CO
