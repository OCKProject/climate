<p id="Par3" class="p">This study analyzes urban tree growth under climate change based on a worldwide increment core sampling and dendrometric tree ring analysis, dating back 150 years. In ten metropolises in boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) we sampled a total of 1383 mostly mature trees (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> for sub-sample sizes) using dendrometric measurements and by taking increment cores for dendrochronological analyses. In each city we selected one common species which occurred from the urban centre to the rural outskirts (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The rationale behind this selection was to obtain an overarching collection of species which typically thrive under the respective site and climate conditions, and to obtain sufficient samples of trees both suffering and not suffering from the urban heat island effect. Only trees showing no visible signs of damage or disease were taken into account for sampling (see Methods section for a detailed description of the sampling procedure).
