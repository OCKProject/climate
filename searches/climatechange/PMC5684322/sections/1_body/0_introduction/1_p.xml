 </sup>. The combination of increasing temperatures, extended growing seasons and reduced or intra-annually redistributed precipitation can increase tree growth in boreal and temperate climate zones, often in higher altitudes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. The same factors, however, reduce growth in warmer and drier zones where plant growth becomes water limited due to these changes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. The latter may apply particularly to plants in city centres where the urban heat island effect can aggravate this limitation

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. These warmer temperatures may substantially affect the living conditions of plants, particularly if precipitation patterns change simultaneously

 </sup>. Therefore, many studies address how climate change, on top of the heat island effect, modifies the manifold functions and services provided by urban plants – especially urban trees – as the most prominent and long-lived elements of urban ecosystems. These previous studies are mainly focused on how climate change alters urban species composition
