<p id="Par5" class="p">We used these data to scrutinize whether tree growth, as expressed by the relationship between tree age and size, differs between urban and rural trees and between recent and past climate conditions in general, and whether such effects differ across climate zones. We chose to evaluate basal area (cross-sectional stem area at a height of 1.3 m) as the tree size variable of interest on the basis that its growth can be straightforwardly reconstructed from increment cores and in light of the fact that it is closely linked to a treeâ€™s biological production
