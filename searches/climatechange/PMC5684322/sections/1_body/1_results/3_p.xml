<p id="Par8" class="p">More detailed analyses, differentiating between the four climate zones, confirm these general results but also reveal interesting peculiarities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>, Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>). In the boreal zone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4A</xref>), both before and after 1960, urban trees showed a very strong superiority in growth compared to their rural counterparts. In both, urban and rural zones, trees have grown significantly faster since 1960 than before. Before 1960, subtropical urban trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3D</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4D</xref>) grew significantly faster than rural trees; after 1960, the rural trees reached about the same level of the age-size relationship as urban trees had before. Although the growth curve of urban trees also changed significantly after 1960, this change is not relevant due to its minor magnitude. For the Mediterranean climate zone, no significant growth differences between urban and rural trees could be detected, either before or after 1960 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4C</xref>), while for both urban zones there is a clear growth acceleration from before 1960 to the subsequent period. The temperate climate zone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">B</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4B</xref>) was the only case we found where urban trees grew significantly slower than rural trees. This holds true for both periods, before and since 1960.
