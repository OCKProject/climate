<p id="Par7" class="p">First, without differentiating between urban and rural trees and between regions, we checked for an overarching difference in tree growth in the periods before and after 1960. This difference proved to be significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>). On average, tree growth since 1960 has occurred more rapidly than before. However, while the relative difference in tree size is negligible up to an age of about 50 years (+2%), it increases with age (+11% and +17% at ages 100 and 150 years, respectively). A second global test without any period and region distinction showed that, on average, urban trees can be expected to reach a greater size than rural trees of the same age (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>). In a closer view, the relative size difference of urban compared to rural trees at the same age declines with increasing age. While it amounts to about 25% at an age of 50 years, it reduces to 18% at 100 years and to 14% at 150 years.
