<p id="Par32" class="p">Following the procedure shown above, we tested within each of the four climate zones whether slopes and intercepts differed i) between urban and rural trees before 1960, ii) between urban trees before and since 1960, iii) between rural trees before and since 1960, and iv) between urban and rural trees since 1960. If such a pair-wise comparison yielded at least one significant
