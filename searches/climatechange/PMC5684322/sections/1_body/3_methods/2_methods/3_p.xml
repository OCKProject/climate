<p id="Par26" class="p">From the increment cores we could trace the stem diameter growth of each tree over at least several decades on an annual basis, resulting in a total of 73,685 observations. These diameter growth series could easily be transformed into the growth of basal area which was the goal variable of our subsequent analyses. We preferred basal area instead of diameter because, in contrast to the latter, it is more directly related to a treeâ€™s biological production. Individual tree ages could be reliably estimated by combining city administration records with increment core series.</p>
