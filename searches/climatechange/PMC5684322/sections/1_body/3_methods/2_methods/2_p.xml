<p id="Par25" class="p">Moreover, two increment cores were taken from each tree using an increment borer with an inner diameter of 5 mm. Coring was done in North and East direction whenever possible; the minimum requirement was an angle of 90Â° between both coring directions in order to minimize the error rate associated with a possible non-concentric growth. Afterwards, the cores were polished on a sanding machine with sandpaper of a coarseness ranging from 120 to 1200 grit, depending on the tree species, in order to achieve optimum visibility of the growth rings. This preparation allowed tree-ring width measurements with a precision of 0.01 mm using a Digital Positiometer after Johann
