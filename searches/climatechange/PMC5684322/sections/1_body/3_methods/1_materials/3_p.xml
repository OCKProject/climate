<p id="Par23" class="p">In each city we started the sampling in the urban centre, and proceeded to the suburban and rural zones. We divided the distance from the centre to the urban, suburban, and rural zones for further sampling and tried to get a third of the total sample in each zone. Because of the varying extension of the selected cities, the sample size varies between 252 trees in Berlin and 66 trees in Brisbane. For our purpose we defined the urban zone of a city as the areas which have been under roof for the longest time. Typically, in this zone the soil is totally sealed and the buildings serve mainly business purposes. As suburban zones we selected areas surrounding the urban zone which are continuously covered by buildings but which are mainly places of residence. Typically, soil sealing is slightly lower in these areas than in the actual urban zone. The rural zone was defined as a habitat surrounding the suburban zone with only sparse, at most village-like structures where trees could grow virtually without the direct influence of buildings and soil sealing. Following this procedure, we sampled a total of 1383 trees comprising 348 (25%) urban, 619 (45%) suburban, and 416 (30%) rural trees. As preliminary analyses showed no significant differences between the growth of urban and suburban trees, we did not distinguish between these groups in the further analysis. These analyses were performed with linear mixed models in a very similar way as described below. Thus, in the following text the term “urban” refers to trees from both the original urban and suburban zones and these together are then contrasted with rural trees in the analyses below.</p>
