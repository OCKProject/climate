<p id="Par21" class="p">For this study we selected ten cities worldwide distributed over four different climate zones, namely boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). A decisive selection criterion was the permission from the municipal authorities to measure and core trees. Based on the tree registers of the municipal administrations and our own local inventories we selected the most frequent tree species of each city that occurred from the city centre to the suburban and the rural area surrounding the city (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Our ideal sampling design was to measure and take increment cores of trees along transects from the centre to the rural area of the cities in all four main directions: north, east, south, and west. Along those four transects, the trees of a given species and size should ideally have been selected at distances of 500–1000 m. In many cases, however, we had to deviate from this idealistic design as trees were missing because of building density, lakes and rivers, or specific features like the Table Mountain without oak trees in Cape Town.
