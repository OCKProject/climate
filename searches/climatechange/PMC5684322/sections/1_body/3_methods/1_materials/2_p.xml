<p id="Par22" class="p">We only sampled trees without visible biotic or abiotic damage in order to differentiate general growth trends from individual disease or damage. All trees were dominant and growing more or less solitarily without direct competition from neighbours. The target size range was 30–70 cm diameter at breast height. However, in order to avoid larger gaps along the transects we also included smaller and larger trees. Despite these exceptions, the mean diameter over all sampled trees was 54 cm and about 73% of the trees lay within the target size range mentioned above.</p>
