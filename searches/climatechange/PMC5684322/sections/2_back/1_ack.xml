 <p class="p">The authors would like to thank the AUDI environmental foundation for funding the project “Response of urban trees on climate change” and the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection for funding the project TUF01UF-64971 “Urban trees under climate change: growth, functions &amp; services, and perspectives”. We are also grateful to the Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry for permanent support of the project W 07 “Long-term experimental plots for forest growth and yield research” (7831-25723-2016). Whereas the first two projects provided records for urban trees, the latter contributed information on trees in forests. We also would like to express our gratitude to the responsible municipal authorities who supported the study and permitted tree sampling.</p>
