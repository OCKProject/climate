<p class="p">The mass of Se lost from the top 30 cm of soil was calculated for the pixels that overlapped in the 1980–1999 and 2080–2099 predictions. Based on these pixels, which represent 48% of the global surface, soil Se concentrations are predicted to drop from 0.331 ± 0.003 mg Se/kg in 1980–1999 to 0.316 ± 0.002 mg Se/kg in 2080–2099 as a result of changes in climate and SOC. Based on the difference, ∼0.0144 mg Se/kg is predicted to be lost, on average, in soils at a depth of 0–30 cm over much of the 21st century. Using the following simple mass balance, we can estimate the total change in soil Se from the top 30 cm of soil:

 <sup class="sup">−11</sup> metric tons of Se). Therefore, the total estimated mass of Se lost from the top 30 cm of soil over a 100-y period is 403,763 tons of Se, which equates to 4,037.6 tons of Se lost per year. This estimate reflects only 48% of the global surface. Based on this estimate, the annual estimated mass of Se lost from soils of 0–30 cm depth is roughly 20–30% of the total estimated mass of Se cycled annually in the atmosphere (13,000–19,000 t); however, it is unknown if this value is expressed in US or metric tons (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), 0.322 mg Se/kg], 13.1 million metric tons of Se are contained within the top 30 cm of soil.
