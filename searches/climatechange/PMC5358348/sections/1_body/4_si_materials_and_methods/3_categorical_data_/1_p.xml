<p class="p">In our modeling, categorical variables (e.g., soil type, land use, lithology) were usually poor predictors of Se and actually led to misleading results. For each category, a separate model is made that restricts the total number of soil Se samples available per model. Machine-learning models are often criticized for overfitting data. We found this overfitting to occur when the sample size was too small and especially when several categories were present with only a few cases per category. This condition resulted in curve fitting and artificially elevated the

This random variable was included in the model for testing purposes and, as a result, the perceived performance of the model increased. The artificial increase in model performance resulting from the use of categorical variables could explain why lithology was of moderate relative importance (
