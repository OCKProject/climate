<p class="p">To predict global soil Se concentrations, a wide variety of soil Se datasets were considered, and not all datasets or samples were included within the analysis. For example, several datasets that targeted or included stream sediments were not included in our analysis. Furthermore, we recognize that Se speciation is an important factor controlling bioavailability; however, broad-scale Se data have been reported exclusively as total Se, and Se speciation datasets with similar sample size and geographic breadth do not exist. Therefore predictive models could be made only for total Se concentrations.</p>
