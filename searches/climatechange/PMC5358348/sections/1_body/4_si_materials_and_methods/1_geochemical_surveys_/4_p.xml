<p class="p">Data from South Africa was provided directly from the Agricultural Research Council Institute for Soil, Climate and Water in a raster format without spatial details of the point locations (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). The raster was based on 3,500 data points collected throughout South Africa. The original raster resolution was ∼0.044° but was aggregated on a 1° cell. After aggregation, the total number of points was 148.
