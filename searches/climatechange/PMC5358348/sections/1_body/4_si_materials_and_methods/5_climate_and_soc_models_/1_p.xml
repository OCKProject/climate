The following CMIP5 models were used: ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, bcc-csm1-1-m, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CESM, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-aMk3-6-0, FGOALS-s2, GFDL-ESM2M, GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R, GISS-E2-H, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, NorESM1-ME, inmcm4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESMMIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M. For each model, only the first ensemble member (r1i1p1) was used. The multimode mean was used in the analysis. The RCP6.0 scenario was used for consistency with the SOC projections. SOC data were derived from runs of the RothC model, driven by mean climate variables from the ECHAM5-A1B model runs, because these give climate forcing similar to the other climate-driver datasets used and because the projected SOC values were not very sensitive to the climate model used to drive RothC (
