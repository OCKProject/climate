<p class="p">Three machine-learning techniques (two ANN models and one RF model) and SEM were used to investigate independently the mechanisms governing soil Se distributions and to predict soil Se concentrations on a global scale (only ANN and RF models were used for predictions). Following variable selection, seven variables [AI, clay content, ET, lithology, pH, precipitation, and SOC (0â€“30 cm depth)] were retained for predictive modeling. These variables also were used for the SEM, but because the SEM was not used for predictive modeling, additional variables (i.e., PET, evaporative index, latitude) were used to quantify direct and indirect interactions between all variables and to evaluate independently the probable mechanisms governing broad-scale soil Se concentrations.</p>
