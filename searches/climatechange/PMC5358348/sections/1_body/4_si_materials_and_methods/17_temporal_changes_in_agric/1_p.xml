<p class="p">Forty-nine soil samples (depth = 0–23 cm) collected in the period 1856–2010 were obtained from the Rothamsted Sample Archive. Soil samples were taken from a control plot (unfertilized since 1843) and two wilderness plots (a maintained grassland and woodland), which were converted from the control plot in 1882 (

Before samples were taken from these jars, each jar was thoroughly mixed. Under a clean air hood, soil was removed from each sample container and weighed (∼5 g). Between each sample, the spatula was wiped clean and rinsed with ethanol.
