<p class="p">The solutions were diluted further by a factor of 10 to reduce the concentration of major elements (e.g., iron) before measurement with inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS. The digested samples were allowed to sit in 50-mL tubes for 24 h. Then 1 mL of the supernatant was diluted with deionized water to 10 mL in a plastic tube. The digested reference material CRM044 was diluted by both a factor of 100 and a factor of 1,000 to match the concentrations of major (first dilution, Fe, Mn) and minor (second dilution, e.g., Se) elements, respectively, to the calibration curves.</p>
