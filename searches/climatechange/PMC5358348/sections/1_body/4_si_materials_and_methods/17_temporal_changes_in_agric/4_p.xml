<p class="p">Total concentrations of Se, As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, P, and Pb were analyzed on an ICP-MS instrument (Agilent 7500cx). Calibration curves were checked by measuring three different liquid reference materials: TMDA 51.2 from the Canadian National Water Research Institute, 1643e from the NIST, and ARS-29, an additional internal reference material from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology. The average Se concentration in the procedural blanks was 12.4 ng/L. Recovery rates for Se in the solid reference materials (25â€“200 mg digested) were 78% for CRM044, 95% for NIST 2704, 101% for GBW07306, and 117% for GBW07408.</p>
