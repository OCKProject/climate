<p class="p">OC was measured in a two-step process. Total carbon (TC) was measured by combustion of the samples in a EuroVector EA 3000 Element Analyzer. Inorganic carbon (IC) was measured with a UIC CM5015 CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> coulometer. The final OC value was obtained by the difference between TC and IC (TC âˆ’ IC = OC).
