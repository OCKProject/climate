<p class="p">The samples were microwave-digested based on method 3051A (
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>). Aliquots of 100–200 mg samples and a ratio of 4 mL HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to 1 mL H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 1 mL H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were added to15-mL polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) containers and were digested at high pressure (180 bar) and high temperature (250 °C) in an UltraCLAVE 4 microwave (Milestone Inc.). After digestion, solutions were transferred quantitatively and diluted to 25 mL (or 50 mL) with deionized water. Four solid reference materials were digested to check the digestion quality and element recovery: soil (silty loam soil reference material: CRM044), river sediments [Buffalo river sediment: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2704], a stream sediment (Chinese stream sediment: GBW07306), and a loess sediment (Chinese loess sediment: GBW07408).
