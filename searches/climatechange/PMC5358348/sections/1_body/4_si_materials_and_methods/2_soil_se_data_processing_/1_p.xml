<p class="p">All Se data were continuous and georeferenced, with the exception of the Chinese data, which was printed in an atlas. The corresponding Se map of China was georeferenced and digitized in ArcGIS 10.2. In addition, each Se data point was binned into 10 classes within the atlas ranging from 0â€“3 mg Se/kg. To have a continuous output, each point was randomly assigned an Se concentration that fell within the range of its particular bin. Furthermore, for data points that were below the limit of detection, each value was assigned a concentration of half the limit of detection instead of the data being deleted.</p>
