<p class="p">The Alaska data consisted of several smaller datasets of varying quality. For example, the lower limit of detection for some datasets was 10.0 mg Se/kg, whereas for other datasets the concentrations were rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg Se/kg. To match the precision of other datasets, only datasets with a lower limit of detection of 0.2 mg Se/kg were retained. Where the value was below this limit, each value was assigned a concentration of 0.1 mg Se/kg, which is half the reported limit of detection (i.e., 0.2 mg Se/kg).</p>
