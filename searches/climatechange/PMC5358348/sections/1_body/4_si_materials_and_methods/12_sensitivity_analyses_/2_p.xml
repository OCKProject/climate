<p class="p">Each of the three zones represents a different suite of environmental conditions. To isolate the individual effects of each predictor variable within each zone, each variable was allowed to vary between the observed minimum and maximum for each zone. The observed range of each variable (i.e., the maximum–minimum) was divided into nine equal intervals. For each variable, the sensitivity analysis was based on 10 points that consisted of the following values: minimum, minimum + 1*(range/9), … , minimum +9*(range/9). All other variables were held constant at the mean value for each particular zone. These suites of values then were entered into the predictive models to obtain 10 soil Se predictions. Because lithology is a categorical variable and has no “average” value, the range of values used for the continuous variables was used for each of the lithological classes, and the final results were averaged together to account for any lithological influences. For lithology sensitivity analyses, each continuous variable was held constant at the zonal values, and only the lithological class was allowed to vary. The predicted soil Se then was plotted against each variable (
