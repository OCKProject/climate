<p class="p">In addition to univariate analyses, we also performed bivariate analyses to evaluate how interactions between two variables affected soil Se concentrations. In bivariate analyses, zones were not used. Instead, each variable was allowed to vary between the minimum and maximum observed value of the 1,642 data points. As with the univariate analysis, 10 points were generated for both variables in the bivariate analysis. To determine how soil Se fluctuated in response to changes in both variables, soil Se was predicted for all possible pairwise combinations (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 100 for all combinations). All other variables were held constant at the average value of the 1,642 data points. The predictive models then were used to predict the results of these inputs. All pairwise comparisons were examined, but only the most influential were included (
