<p class="p">To determine how each variable independently affected soil Se, we performed uni- and bivariate sensitivity analyses for each predictive model. For univariate sensitivity analyses, we specifically wanted to describe how different environmental conditions affected soil Se concentrations. To obtain these environmental conditions, we first performed a two-step cluster analysis in SPSS 22. The optimal number of clusters was automatically generated (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3 zones). In initial cluster analyses, the clusters were dominated by variables that had large domains. Therefore, the standardized z-scores of all variables were used in the cluster analysis. Thus all continuous variables contributed more equally to the dataâ€™s classification. Lithology was excluded from the analysis because it is a categorical variable. A PCA was used to describe the physicochemical and climate characteristics of the three zones generated in the cluster analysis (

The variables with the highest correlation with PC1 were pH and precipitation. PC2 was most correlated with SOC and clay content: positive values indicate soils with high clay content and low SOC, and negative PC2 values indicate the opposite. Therefore, the three zones can be described as high aridity/high pH/high clay (zone 1), high SOC/low aridity (zone 2), and high precipitation/high clay (zone 3).
