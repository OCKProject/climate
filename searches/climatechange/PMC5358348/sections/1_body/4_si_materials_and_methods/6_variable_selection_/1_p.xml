<p class="p">We used four techniques to evaluate whether each predictor variable should be included in the final model: correlations, PCA, backward elimination with artificial neural network (ANN) models, and RF node-purity analyses. All techniques were used simultaneously. The correlation and PCA analyses assume normality, which was assessed for all variables by examining the skew of the data. Variables were deemed normally distributed if the |skew| &lt;1. Variables that were not normally distributed were either log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> or square-root transformed, which also reduced the influence of outliers.
