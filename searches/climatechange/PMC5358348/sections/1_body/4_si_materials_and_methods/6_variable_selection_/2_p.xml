<p class="p">Pearsonâ€™s correlation was used to check for multicollinearity. Predictor variables that were highly correlated (i.e., |r| &gt;0.7) were evaluated further using partial correlations. Partial correlations were used to examine effects of a particular variable on Se while controlling for the effects of a third. Variables that were spuriously correlated with Se were removed from the analysis.</p>
