<p class="p">PCA is a commonly used variable-selection technique that summarizes the variability within a dataset into a small number of uncorrelated principal components (PCs). The first two PCs were retained for analysis because they summarize the greatest amount of information within the dataset. Therefore predictor variables that were poorly correlated with PCs 1 and 2 (i.e., variables that contain the least information) were removed from the analysis. In addition to normality, PCA assumes linearity between variables. Therefore, pairwise comparisons between variables were examined for extreme nonlinearities (e.g., horseshoe-shaped relationships); none were detected. Nevertheless, PCA was used with caution in removing variables.</p>
