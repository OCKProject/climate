<p class="p">We also used an iterative backward elimination procedure using ANN models (NNET in R and Multilayer Perceptron in SPSS) (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>). All variables were added to the ANN model. The ANN model was run and the error was computed using the entire set of inputs. For a given input variable, all values were replaced with the variable mean, and the model was rerun to calculate the new error. For each variable, the difference in error was calculated. More relevant inputs produced higher error differences when removed and thus had greater predictive power in the model. Variables with lower predictive power, and thus low change in error when removed during the elimination procedure, were removed from the analysis. The same analysis was repeated using the variable importance. Variables with the lowest variable importance were removed first. The results of the variable selection when using the error and variable importance were similar.
