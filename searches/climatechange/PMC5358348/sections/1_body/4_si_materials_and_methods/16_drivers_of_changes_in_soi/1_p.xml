<p class="p">Changes in future soil Se concentrations were modeled using changes in climate and SOC data for 2080–2099. To identify the variables driving the changes in soil Se between future and recent periods, changes in climate and soil variables (ΔAI, ΔET, Δprecipitation, and ΔSOC) were used to model changes in soil Se concentrations (ΔSe) on a global scale using the Multilayer Perceptron model in SPSS. Because different variables were responsible for driving losses and gains, separate models were generated that analyzed only pixels with predicted gains and only pixels with predicted losses. The relative variable importance of the predictive models was used to identify the variables in the model driving changes in soil Se concentrations (
