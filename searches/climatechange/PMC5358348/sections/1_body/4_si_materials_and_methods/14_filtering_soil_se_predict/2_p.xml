<p class="p">Future soil Se predictions were filtered using two criteria. First, the SD and the mean of the predictive tools was used to screen the data. If the SD was &gt;10% of the mean (i.e., SD &gt; 0.1*mean) for a particular pixel, that pixel was removed from the analysis. The data that remained were almost exclusively pixels that were predicted to have small changes in soil Se concentrations, because of the variability in the range of the predictive models. For example, the RF model was the most extreme, with predicted changes ranging from −71 to 89%. The NNET model had predicted changes ranging from −52 to 90%, and the Multilayer Perceptron model had predicted changes ranging from −29 to 27%. Therefore, high changes for the RF model corresponded to relatively moderate changes in the Multilayer Perceptron model, leading to a high SD. Although the models corroborated each other in many instances (i.e., all three models predicted change in the same direction), the magnitude of the change resulted in a larger SD relative to the mean. Instead of increasing the SD:mean ratio, we added a second filter that captured pixels where there was good corroboration between the models. If all three models corroborated one other, the pixel was retained regardless of the SD. By increasing only the SD:mean ratio cutoff criteria, more pixels were included where the corroboration between the models was low (i.e., two models predicted loss and the other predicted gain and vice versa). This filtering resulted in pixels predicted to have low change because positive and negative predictions canceled out each other. The estimates resulting from the use of these two filtering approaches were deemed reliable either because there was high precision in the estimate or there was good corroboration between the models.</p>
