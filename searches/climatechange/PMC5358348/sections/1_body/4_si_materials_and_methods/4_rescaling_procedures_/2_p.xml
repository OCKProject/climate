 <xref rid="st01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). Because the soil Se concentrations were averaged on a 1° scale, all predictor variables were also averaged on a 1° scale. All data were imported into ArcGIS 10.2 and were resampled using the Resample (Data Management) tool. The bilinear resampling technique was used to interpolate values from the continuous raster linearly. For categorical data (e.g., lithology, land use, and soil type), we used the majority resampling technique, which identified the dominant category within each 1° cell.
