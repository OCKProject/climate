<p class="p">Each of datasets had different sampling, preparation, and analytical procedures, and these differences might bias the overall modeling results. To minimize the bias of any particular dataset, the entire dataset was resampled based on equal data representation (all datasets were equally represented based on sample size), equal density (each dataset was represented by the same sample density), equal scale (all points within a 1.0Â° cell were averaged and represented by a single value), and randomly (all data were sampled at random). For the equal data representation and equal-density resampling schemes, the datasets with the lowest number of points (Republic of Ireland) and lowest sampling density (China) determined the threshold sample size for the other datasets. Once this threshold was set, all points from all other datasets were selected at random to satisfy the selected criteria. For the equal scale and random datasets, all data were used for predictive modeling. The same cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of each model: 90% of the data were randomly selected for model training, and 10% were selected for cross-validation. Based on the performance of the cross-validation model, the equal-scale resampling performed the best. One drawback of this technique is that information is lost by averaging the data, and this loss could be problematic if small-scale or site-specific processes contribute to soil Se concentrations; however, because the goal was to evaluate the broad-scale processes, this reduction in information was deemed acceptable, especially given that this technique outperformed the other techniques.</p>
