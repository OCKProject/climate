<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Micronutrients are essential for maintaining human health, and although they are needed in only trace amounts, deficiencies reportedly affect 3 billion people worldwide (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). One such micronutrient is selenium. Inadequate dietary Se intake affects up to 1 in 7 people and is also known to affect livestock health adversely (

 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). Because dietary Se intake depends largely on Se content in soil and bioavailability to crops (

 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>), understanding the mechanisms driving soil concentrations and predicting global distributions could help prevent Se deficiency (

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Apart from soils, Se is present in all other environmental compartments [i.e., the lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>)], which all play a role in global Se biogeochemical cycling and distribution (
