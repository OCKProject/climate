<p class="p">Sensitivity analyses were performed during each iteration to investigate the independent effect of each variable on modeled soil Se concentrations. Based on all input variables, three environmental zones were identified using a two-step cluster analysis (

 </xref>). Based on the data from each zone, individual parameters were allowed to vary while all other variables were held constant at the zonal averages. By using different zones, we could model the response of soil Se to changes in particular variables under different environmental conditions. These analyses allowed us to identify the most likely mechanism driving soil Se concentrations by comparing the predictions made by various hypotheses (
