In addition, we obtained 26 variables describing factors hypothesized to control soil Se concentrations and moderate climate change projections (RCP 6.0 for climate and A1B for SOC data; 
 <xref rid="st01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S1</xref> for variable descriptions and citations). All data within a 1° cell were averaged and represented by a single value. To minimize the influence of errors and/or outliers within the datasets, pixels containing fewer than five Se data points were removed from the analysis (

Although 16 lithological classes were present within the raster dataset, classes that were represented by too few soil Se data points (
