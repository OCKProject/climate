<p class="p">Each predictive model was also used to predict future (2080–2099) soil Se concentrations based on projected climate and SOC changes. Future datasets did not exist for all variables (e.g., clay content); such variables were included within the prediction, but their values were identical in the two time points. Although some variables (e.g., sand, silt, and clay content) are not likely to change considerably, changes in other variables, such as soil pH, are likely to result in changes in soil Se concentrations. Therefore, we discuss only potential changes in soil Se concentrations resulting from climate change instead of reporting actual soil Se concentrations. Future predictions were retained if the SD of the future prediction was &lt;10% of the mean prediction (i.e., SD &lt; 0.1*mean) or if the three models predicted the same direction (loss or gain) of change (
