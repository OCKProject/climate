<p class="p">In addition to predictive analyses, we developed a conceptual model describing broad-scale soil Se concentrations based on mechanistic knowledge gained from the literature and on climate knowledge gained from predictive analyses. This proposed model was evaluated using SEM (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) to test different hypotheses proposed to govern soil Se concentrations, (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) to evaluate simultaneously the relative importance of these different hypothesized mechanisms, and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects (i.e., mediated effects) of the variables on soil Se concentrations (the direct effects generated from the SEM analysis are analogous to the univariate sensitivity analysis of the machine-learning models). Although SEM is not predictive, it has advantages over the predictive models because it can quantify both the direct and indirect effects of all variables more easily, and it was used to help identify important interactions among variables. The SEM was considered a good fit if the SRMR was ≤0.8 and the CFI was ≥0.95 (

All error intervals presented represent 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted. All statistical procedures were performed using the software packages R (v. 3.3.2, R Development Core Team, Vienna), SPSS (v. 22, IBM. Corp., Armonk, NY), and SPSS-Amos (v. 22, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and all spatial procedures were performed using the software packages ArcMap [v. 10.2.2, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA] and R.
