 </xref>). Each model was iterated 1,000 times using 90% of the data for model training and 10% of the data for cross-validation for each iteration. The training and cross-validation data were chosen at random for each iteration. The model predictions were averaged to estimate recent (1980â€“1999) global soil Se concentrations; however, predictions were considered valid only if the environmental parameters for each pixel fit within the domain of the observed data (
