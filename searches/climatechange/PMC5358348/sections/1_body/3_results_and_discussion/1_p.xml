<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">After variable selection, seven variables were retained and were considered the most important factors controlling soil Se concentrations: the aridity index (AI, unitless) [i.e., the ratio of potential evapotranspiration (PET, mm/d) to precipitation (mm/d)]; clay content (%); evapotranspiration (ET, mm/d); lithology; pH; precipitation (mm/d); and SOC (0–30 cm depth, tons of C/ha). With these variables, the accuracy of the predictive model was high (average

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>), and, based on the predictive model sensitivity analyses and the SEM regression weights, the modeling results corroborated each other strongly (see following section), suggesting that processes driving soil Se concentrations were described accurately. Because the data were averaged on a 1° scale, this modeling approach likely captures the broad-scale mechanisms but potentially misses important local-scale factors.
