<p class="p">Soil Se concentrations were determined largely by interactions between climate and soil variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01" class="xref">Figs. S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">S3</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">S4</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). In the SEM, AI and precipitation had the greatest direct and indirect effect, respectively, on soil Se concentrations (
 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). Based on averaged relative importance from the predictive models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>), AI was the most important predictor (100 ± 0.3%) followed by pH (60 ± 0.7%), precipitation (58 ± 1%), ET (50 ± 0.8%), clay content (45 ± 0.4%), lithology (33 ± 0.5%), and SOC (29 ± 0.5%). Sensitivity analyses were performed on these variables to determine if the mechanisms driving soil Se concentrations changed in different zones represented by different environmental conditions (

  <italic class="italic">SI Materials and Methods</italic>
 </xref> for a description). The soil Se patterns were similar between different zones, suggesting that Se drivers were consistent regardless of the environment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). This result suggests that the models can be used to predict soil Se concentrations in other regions of the world. In sensitivity analyses, soil Se increased with increases in clay content and with decreases in soil pH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Figs. S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">S4</xref>), both of which are known to increase soil Se sorption (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). Although soil Se is known to partition/complex with organic matter (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>), soil Se was affected only weakly by changes in SOC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01" class="xref">Figs. S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">S3</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, changes in lithological classes resulted in negligible changes in soil Se when other variables were held constant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). Although lithology was of minor importance in this study, we recognize that it can influence soil Se concentrations at local scales (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>).
