<p class="p">Global predictions were made using models trained largely using temperate/midlatitude datasets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig02" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). Although the available data adequately described similar regions, data from tropical, extremely arid, and polar regions were almost entirely absent (to the best of our knowledge, no broad-scale soil geochemical surveys are available from these regions). As a result, predictions that were made for environments that fell outside our dataset’s domain were excluded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig05" class="xref">Fig. S5</xref>). Therefore, Se predictions for 1980–1999 were retained for only 70% of land surfaces. The majority of croplands and rangelands, which are areas of primary interest, given that soil Se concentrations and bioavailability in these regions largely drive the Se status in humans and livestock, fall largely within the retained areas.
