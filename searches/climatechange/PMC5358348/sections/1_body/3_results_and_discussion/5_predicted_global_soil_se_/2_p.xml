<p class="p">Based on predictive models, the global mean soil Se concentration for 1980–1999 was 0.322 ± 0.002 mg Se/kg (

 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). Using this estimate, ∼13.1 million metric tons of Se are stored in the top 30 cm of soil within the predicted area [i.e., ∼70% of world’s land surface (1.04 × 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) in temperate and northern latitudes. In wet equatorial regions, concentrations were typically 0.3–0.5 mg Se/kg. Relatively low-Se soils (&lt;0.2 mg Se/kg) were predicted for 15% of modeled areas and were restricted primarily to arid and semiarid regions in Argentina, Australia, Chile, China, southern Africa, and the southwestern United States. In some of these countries, low Se content in crops and livestock has been reported (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>), but it is important to note that many factors contribute to low Se content in plants (e.g., plant uptake pathways, soil Se speciation, and the abundance of competing ions such as sulfate) (
