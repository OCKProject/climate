<p class="p">Although our analysis indicates that future climate change will likely result in widespread changes in soil Se, it does not indicate rates of change. To understand the temporal changes in soil Se concentrations better, we analyzed for soil Se and SOC in a subset of agricultural samples collected from the Broadbalk Experiment (Rothamsted, United Kingdom) between 1865 and 2010. Soil samples were taken from a control plot (unfertilized since 1843) and two “wilderness” plots (a maintained grassland and woodland), which were converted from the control plot in 1882 (

 </xref>, and 
 <xref rid="st03" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). The accumulation of Se in soil through time was statistically greater in the wilderness plots than in the control plot [one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); year:

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01; plot 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2, 31) = 17.3, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01]. When controlling for SOC, however, there were no statistical differences between the plots (ANCOVA; SOC: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(1, 30) = 10.7, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01; year: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(1, 30) = 6.0, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05; plot: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2, 30) = 3.2, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05), indicating that increases in SOC were driving soil Se accumulation in the model (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>). Natural changes in soil Se concentrations previously have been hypothesized to occur over longer time scales (e.g., hundreds to thousands of years) (
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>); however, given that SOC and Se began to accumulate on these plots immediately after conversion, these results suggest that changes in soil Se will follow environmental changes rapidly, perhaps on an annual to decadal time scale. Between ∼1880 and 1980, soil Se concentrations increased by ∼15, 35, and 60% on the control, grassland, and woodland plots, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig07" class="xref">Fig. S7</xref>), indicating that the magnitude of changes predicted to occur by the end of the 21st century is plausible. The rates of change in soil Se concentrations following environmental perturbations is largely unstudied and should be evaluated further to understand soil Se dynamics better.
