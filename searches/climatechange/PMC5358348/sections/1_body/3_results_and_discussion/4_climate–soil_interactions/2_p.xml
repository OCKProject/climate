<p class="p">In bivariate sensitivity analyses, both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed and were strongest between aridity, precipitation, clay content, and pH. In univariate sensitivity analyses, when all other variables were held constant, modeled soil Se concentrations were highest under low AI (0.83 mg Se/kg), low precipitation (0.65 mg Se/kg), low pH (0.51 mg Se/kg), and relatively high clay content (0.47 mg Se/kg) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). It is important to note that, as long as PET is sufficiently low, environments with low precipitation can have low AI values also. Furthermore, sensitivity and SEM analyses suggest that the direct (i.e., nonmediated) effect of precipitation drives Se leaching from soils (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Figs. S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">S4</xref>), thus explaining why low values resulted in high soil Se, even though the net effect is positive (
 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). In bivariate sensitivity analyses, soil Se concentrations exceeded these values when low AI was modeled with low pH (1.12 mg Se/kg), when low precipitation was modeled with high clay content (0.86 mg Se/kg), and when high clay content was modeled with low pH (0.56 mg Se/kg) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>). Although Se concentrations were typically enhanced in low-AI or low-precipitation environments, both variables could suppress the effects of other variables in high-AI or high-precipitation environments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>). These results demonstrate the dependence of soil Se concentrations on soilâ€“climate interactions. Based on these analyses, low-Se soils are most likely to occur in arid environments and in areas with high pH and low clay content. Conversely, areas with low to moderate precipitation but relatively low aridity (e.g., cool and moist climates) and high clay content are likely to have higher soil Se concentrations.
