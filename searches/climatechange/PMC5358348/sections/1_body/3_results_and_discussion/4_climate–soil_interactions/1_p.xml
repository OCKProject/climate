<p class="p">Although the direct effects of precipitation (i.e., leaching) were moderate, its indirect effects (i.e., those mediated through other variables) were approximately threefold larger (

 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). Although there was a negative direct effect between precipitation and soil Se, the sum of direct and indirect effects resulted in precipitation having a net positive effect (
