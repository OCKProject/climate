<p class="p">Future predictions were made for the entire globe, but, based on the filtering criteria used (

 </xref>), predictions were retained for ∼48% of the global land area. Based on these pixels alone, soil Se concentrations were predicted to drop by 4.3% on average, from 0.331 ± 0.003 mg Se/kg in 1980–1999 to 0.316 ± 0.002 mg Se/kg in 2080–2099, as a result of changes in climate and SOC concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). For soil at a depth of 0–30 cm, this loss corresponds to ∼403,763 tons of Se over 100 y, or 4,037.6 tons of Se lost per year (

 </xref> for the calculation), an amount that is ∼20–30% of the total estimated Se mass that is cycled yearly through the troposphere [i.e., 13,000–19,000 tons (assumed to be metric tons)/y (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>)], although our estimate is only for 48% of the land surface. Our modeling approach is not a mass balance model, so Se fate could not be investigated. Nonetheless, changes in Se concentrations in other environmental compartments are known from the past. For example, marine Se concentrations throughout various periods of the Phanerozoic eon have been 1.5–2 orders of magnitude lower than current oceanic concentrations (
