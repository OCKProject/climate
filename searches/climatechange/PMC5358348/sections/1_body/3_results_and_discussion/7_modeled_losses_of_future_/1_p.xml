<p class="p">The interactions between precipitation and other soil/climate variables strongly suggest that climate changes could drive changes in soil Se concentrations. To assess the influence of changes in climate and SOC, soil Se was modeled for 2080â€“2099 using moderate climate change scenarios [Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 6.0 for precipitation, AI, and ET (

 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>)]. Other climate scenarios (e.g., RCP 8.5) were not used because SOC data were available only for A1B scenarios, which are most similar to RCP 6.0.
