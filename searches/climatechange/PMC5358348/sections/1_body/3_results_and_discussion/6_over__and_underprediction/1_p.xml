<p class="p">In an attempt to identify potential missing variables, we examined the residuals of the predictive models. Spatial patterns of any missing variable should match those of the residuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig02" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). Overall, the models underpredicted soil Se concentrations (average residual = −0.036 ± 0.009 mg Se/kg), suggesting that Se sources may be missing from the model. On a localized level, soil Se concentrations appear to be underpredicted in regions adjacent to regions of high marine productivity (e.g., western Alaska, western Ireland, western Norway, western England, and Wales) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig02" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). Marine environments are thought to increase soil Se concentrations via wet deposition (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>), and atmospheric deposition of Se thus could explain some of the model’s underprediction. However, global spatial data do not exist for Se deposition and thus could not be analyzed. We included population density as a potential proxy for anthropogenic emissions, but this was one of the least important variables in the variable selection procedure. We evaluated a wide variety of qualitative factors [e.g., specific agricultural soil types (e.g., paddy soils), specific sedimentary depositional environments (e.g., glacial deposits), coal power plants, carbonaceous shale deposits, and others] that may affect soil Se distributions; however, we found no consistent discernable link between these variables and the broad-scale distribution of the model residuals.
