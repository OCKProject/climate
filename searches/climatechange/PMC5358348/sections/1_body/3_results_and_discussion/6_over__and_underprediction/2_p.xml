<p class="p">Despite the underprediction, overall patterns of modeled soil Se distribution match the actual distribution quite closely (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig02" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>), and 71% of predicted values were within ±0.05 mg Se/kg of the observed value, indicating that a majority of the predicted data were relatively accurate. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis and SEM trends closely match hypothesized mechanisms governing soil Se concentrations reported in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig03" class="xref">Figs. S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04" class="xref">S4</xref>). This finding suggests that the models are largely accurate and capture the dominant processes controlling broad-scale Se distributions. Nevertheless, future studies could include additional predictor variables, especially those that are currently unavailable, to provide better estimates of broad-scale soil Se. Furthermore, to overcome some of this study’s limitations, predictions could be made on more local/regional scales using higher resolution data.
