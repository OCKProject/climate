<p class="p">Climate variables (i.e., AI, precipitation, and ET) were dominant factors driving soil Se concentrations, likely because they control leaching from soils, and observed patterns within the sensitivity and SEM analyses for all climate variables are consistent with this hypothesis. High precipitation and AI negatively affected soil Se concentrations, whereas ET positively affected soil Se concentrations (

 <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). Although AI (i.e., the ratio of PET to precipitation) and precipitation are inversely related, both variables exerted negative effects on soil Se, suggesting that separate mechanisms drive these patterns. Although precipitation increases the transport of dissolved Se species in soil solution by increasing vadose zone flow, AI likely affects leaching by controlling soil redox conditions and thus Se speciation, sorption, and mobility. It has been reported that as AI increases (i.e., PET increases relative to precipitation), soils become drier (

 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>). Therefore, soil drying likely increases the presence of oxidized/mobile soil Se species, which can be leached during subsequent rain events.
