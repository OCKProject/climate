<p class="p">Soil drying likely increases Se mobility but also can reduce soil Se transport (although these processes likely occur at different time scales). Leaching is driven by the ratio of ET to precipitation (also known as the “evaporative index,” EI) (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>). As previously mentioned, precipitation increases the transport of Se through the vadose zone, but as ET increases relative to precipitation, more moisture is removed from the soil column. This removal of moisture reduces the vadose zone flow, which in turn reduces Se mass transport. In theory, when ET and precipitation are equal, leaching should be negligible. Although ET clearly dampens the negative effects of precipitation in bivariate sensitivity analyses, a negative relationship existed between precipitation and modeled Se despite an ET:precipitation ratio of 1 (

 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Therefore, in addition to its positive indirect effect by reducing leaching, ET also may have a direct negative effect on soil Se by increasing plant uptake. This direct negative effect was observed in the SEM analysis, but the relationship was not statistically significant and therefore was removed. Although this negative effect may exist, it appears to be less important than the role ET plays in reducing Se leaching. Given the importance of climate variables in governing soil Se concentrations, the observed patterns between AI, precipitation, ET, and modeled soil Se concentrations strongly suggest that changes in climate will result in changes in soil Se concentrations in time and space.
