<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">One of our aims was to identify the broad-scale mechanisms governing soil Se retention. Therefore, at a 1Â° resolution, the data used are likely too coarse to evaluate or identify the influence of many small- to regional-scale factors (e.g., local sources, specific soil and rock types, and so forth) affecting soil Se retention. To evaluate small-scale soil Se distributions or to test locally relevant hypotheses, scale-appropriate models are necessary.</p>
