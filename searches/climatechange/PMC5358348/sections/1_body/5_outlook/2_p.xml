<p class="p">Although some effects of climate change on global food security are predictable (e.g., decreased food production resulting from increased water stress), the predicted widespread reductions in soil Se caused by climate change were less foreseeable. Changes in other factors (e.g., specific Se sources, soil properties, soil and rock weathering, and others.) will likely have an additional effect on soil Se, but these factors were not analyzed because future projections for soil pH and clay content and spatial information on the contributions of anthropogenic and natural sources of Se are currently unavailable. These variables are likely to have an effect on soil Se concentrations. For example, given changes in industrial SO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions (
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>), soil pH will likely increase (
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>). Increases in pH may result in further losses of soil Se concentrations, given that soil Se and soil pH are inversely related. Therefore, updated soil Se predictions are likely to change as additional data become available.
