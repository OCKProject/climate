<p class="p">Given the importance of climateâ€“soil interactions on soil Se distributions, it is likely that other trace elements with similar retention mechanisms will experience similar reductions as the result of climatic change. Coupled with micronutrient stripping from agricultural lands (
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>), predicted losses of total Se in soils indicate that the nutritional quality of food may decrease, thereby increasing the worldwide risk of micronutrient deficiency. However, as stated previously, total soil Se concentrations are not the only factor determining Se levels in plants. Lower Se levels in soils could potentially compound the problems associated with the decrease in the nutritional value of some plants resulting from elevated atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>). Potential micronutrient losses from agricultural soils could be offset by implementing agricultural practices that increase their retention [e.g., organic carbon (OC) adjustment]; however, such strategies may not increase soil Se in areas of increasing aridity, given the importance of AI in governing soil Se concentrations. Where soils cannot be manipulated to increase the long-term retention of Se, broad-scale micronutrient fertilization may be necessary to maintain an adequate nutrient content in crops.
