  <p class="p">Performance and variable importance of the predictive models. (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) Scatter plot of the observed and predicted soil Se concentrations (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,642) based on the predictive models including the average training and cross-validation (CV) performance (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,000 iterations per model). (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) The average variable importance for the recent (1980–1999) predictions was calculated for each model iteration (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,000) for all three predictive models. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine that the mean importance of the variables were statistically different (statistical values are given in the figure). The Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test was used to determine that all variables were statistically different from all others at α = 0.05 (differences are indicated by different letters; 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.013 for all variables). (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) Predicted losses and gains in soil Se were modeled between 1980–1999 and 2080–2099 based on changes in climate variables and SOC. The percentages below the variables indicate the average percentage change in each variable for all modeled pixels. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
