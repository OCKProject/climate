  <p class="p">Multivariate interactions between predictor variables and soil Se. (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) An hypothesized model of the variables controlling soil Se concentrations was tested using SEM. All aggregated soil Se data points (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,642) were used in the model. The solid lines indicate positive direct relationships and dotted lines indicate negative direct relationships between variables. Variables and lines colored red, blue, purple, and tan correspond to energy, precipitation, energy:precipitation ratios, and soil parameters, respectively. Standardized indirect effects and total effects can be found in 
   <xref rid="st02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table S2</xref>. (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) Bivariate interactions between clay content and pH (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) and between precipitation and clay content (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) are illustrated. In bivariate analyses, parameters were allowed to vary between the minimum and maximum observed value with all other variables held constant at the observed mean value of the entire dataset (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,642).
