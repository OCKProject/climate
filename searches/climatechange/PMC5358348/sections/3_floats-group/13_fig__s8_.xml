  <p class="p">Se concentrations for soil samples measured in 2016 vs. Se values extracted for the same location from a 1960s contour map. The data on the 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis were collected from a recent standardized soil geochemical survey (
   <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>); the data on the 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis were published as a contour map in the mid-1960s (the exact date is unknown) (
   <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>). The map from the 1960s was digitized in ArcGIS 10.2, and for each of the data points from the recent geochemical survey, the corresponding concentration was recorded from the digitized map. Because the data within the map were binned, each point was randomly assigned a concentration value that fell within the range of the bin.
