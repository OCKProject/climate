  <p class="p">Temporal trends of analytes in agricultural soils from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiments. Total soil Se (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) and SOC (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) concentrations were measured in the control, woodland, and grassland plots. Samples were analyzed from soils that were originally collected from 1865–2010. In 1882 (vertical dashed line), part of the control plot was left uncultivated and maintained as grassland and forest (collectively referred to as the “wilderness”). Error bars represent SDs (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2–4).
