  <p class="p">Univariate and bivariate sensitivity analyses of the predictive models. (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) The independent effects of AI (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) and precipitation (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) were modeled by holding all other variables constant at the zonal averages as defined by the two-step clustering. (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">D</italic>) Similarly, bivariate interactions between AI and clay (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) and between precipitation and ET (
   <italic class="italic">D</italic>) are illustrated. These parameters were allowed to vary between the minimum and maximum observed value while all other variables were held constant at the mean value of the entire dataset (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,642). The dotted line in 
   <italic class="italic">D</italic> indicates the conditions in which ET = precipitation. Other bivariate interactions are presented in
