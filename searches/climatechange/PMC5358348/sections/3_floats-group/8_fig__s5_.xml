  <p class="p">Multivariate and geographic distributions of the three zones generalizing the soil and climate properties of the 1,642 aggregated data points following two-step clustering. (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) Scatter plot of PCs 1 and 2. Together PCs 1 and 2 account for 75.1% of the variability (46.8% and 28.3%, respectively) within the entire dataset. The variables with the greatest correlation are included along the axis. A polygon was drawn around this distribution, and if the points fell outside this polygon, the predictions were excluded. (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) Correlation matrix between both PCs and each continuous predictor variable. (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) The geographic distribution of each zone for known areas (
