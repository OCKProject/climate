 <result pre="The community does not use any modern technologies to gauge" exact="weather" post="changes; rather they attribute sickness, crop failures and other"/>

 <result pre="similarities between perceptions of common people and scientific data on" exact="climate" post="change in Bangladesh. First, people living in the coastal"/>

 <result pre="public understanding of risks. At the beginning of this century," exact="climate" post="change and global warming became ‘grand narratives’ [ 6]"/>
 <result pre="politics, and the public. As mentioned above, media coverage of" exact="climate" post="change is crucial in bridging the gap between scientific"/>
