<p class="p">Given that spatial autocorrelation was performed for most OLS regression models (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Moranâ€™s test), we next considered a SEVM modeling approach to remove spatial autocorrelation in the regression residuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Specifically, we adopted the Moran eigenvector approach using the function 
 <italic class="italic">SpatialFiltering</italic> in the R package 
 <italic class="italic">spdep</italic>. As with the OLS regression analyses, we constructed full models and then selected the best model based on AICc values. The spatial filter was fixed in the model-selection procedures [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. We also obtained the averaged models, and estimated the relative importance of each explanatory variable in the SEVM modeling. The residuals of the explanatory variables and network parameters were calculated according to the SEVM modeling approach-based best models.
