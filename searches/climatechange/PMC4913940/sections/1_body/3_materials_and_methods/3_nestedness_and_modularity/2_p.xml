Consideration of degree distributions is important for evaluating the statistical significance of network properties of real-world ecological networks because they influence both nestedness and modularity [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. For food-web (i.e. unipartite directed networks) null-model networks, we used randomized networks generated from real-world food webs via an edge-switching algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. This algorithm produces random networks by rewiring two randomly selected edges in the real-world network until the switching of all edges is completed, preserving the number of one-way incoming edges, one-way outgoing edges, and mutual edges for each node (see the supporting online material in [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] for details). For degree preserving, one-way edges and mutual edges are considered separately when switching two edges; for instance, consider two edges, A→B and C→D, where the letters and arrows represent nodes and one-way edges, respectively. Through this edge-switching algorithm, the edges A→D and C→B are obtained if the switching generates no multiple edges or self-edges. For mutual edges, two edges are switched through a similar procedure, with A↔D and C↔B generated from A↔B and C↔D. For pollination and seed-dispersal networks (i.e. bipartite networks), the null model II [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] was used, which generates random bipartite networks with degree distributions that are similar to those of empirical networks. In the null model, the probability that a plant connects to an animal is proportional to the product of node degrees for a given plant or animal.
