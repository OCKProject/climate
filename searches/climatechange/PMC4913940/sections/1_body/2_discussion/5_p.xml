<p class="p">As pointed out in our earlier study [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], the conclusions we reached here are limited to binary (i.e., unweighted) networks. However, it is also important to consider weighted network analysis, as a different conclusion may be derived from comparisons between weighted networks and binary networks. For example, nestedness is statistically significant in binary networks, but not in weighted networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], and temperature seasonality was correlated with the weighted version of modularity, but not with the binary version of modularity [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, binary networks were considered in this study because the datasets we used include numerous binary data (Materials and Methods). Moreover, the definition of interaction weight is not uniform throughout the ecological-network datasets. The interaction weight assigned to a given species pair is based on the number of contacts they share; however, the weight need to be corrected (or normalized) for factors such as sampling effort and species abundance. Such normalization methods differ among studies. Therefore, we assumed a binary network approach to represent all ecological networks in order to avoid issues resulting from these variations.
