<p class="p">Additional research is required, however. For example, we estimated climate-change velocities based on the difference between the current and last glacial maximum climate conditions (Materials and Methods), as was done in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, the time-scale of these velocities may be too long in terms of ecological-network assemblies; a possible reason was discussed in a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], but briefly, this may be because of the most important climatic shift in the Quaternary (past 2.6 million yr). In particular, glacial cold maxima and warm interglacials were periodically repeated during this period, and the most recent, and one of the strongest, climatic shift occurred between last glacial maximum (21,000 yr bp) and the present. This recent shift has been shown to have influenced geographical patterns of species endemism, for example [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], suggesting that species composition (and ecological-network assemblies, as a result) are more unstable in areas that have experienced larger climatic shifts. However, it is also important to consider short-range climate-change velocity. In this context, a new index [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] of the velocity of temperature change, derived from spatial gradients and multi-model ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase over the 21
