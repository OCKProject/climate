<p class="p">As mentioned in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], our analysis has several limitations, as do many other analyses of ecological networks. For example, we examined antagonistic (i.e., food webs) and mutualistic networks separately despite a mixture of interaction types (i.e., antagonistic interactions and mutualistic interactions) being more representative of real-world ecosystems and thus ecosystem stability [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Therefore, measurements of network parameters for multiple network types need to be considered in the future in order to evaluate ecological networks under more realistic conditions. In particular, multiple network analysis, which is commonly used in social-network research, can take into consideration many different types of links [
