<p class="p">Alternative hypotheses must also be considered, especially in regard to the relationship between current climate and ecological networks. In food-web networks, for example, modularity increased with precipitation seasonality; given that climate seasonality can be considered as an environmental perturbation [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], the observed associations suggest that food webs vary to increase ecosystem stability against climate seasonality, consistent with predictions. A number of food-web networks included in this study derived from freshwater and estuarine areas; thus, that precipitation seasonality has an effect on network structure may be a reasonable supposition [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In short, these results imply that ecological networks may be generally adapted to changing environmental conditions.
