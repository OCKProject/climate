<p class="p">It is possible that sampling effort affects nestedness and modularity when considering the speciesâ€“area relationship [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which states that the number of observed species increases with the observed area. In this study, we could not obtain the relevant information on sampling effort because it is not always clearly delineated in the literature. However, this limitation poses little problem because the effect of species number was removed from the statistical analysis, and earlier work [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] suggested that nestedness and modularity are mostly independent of sampling effort (observation area and observation time). In addition, we did not consider the effects of phylogenetic signals because species descriptions in the networks are partially unknown or ambiguous. However, the absence of phylogenetic signals is unlikely to have a significant effect, as several studies have reported that phylogenetic signals are weak in ecological networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Moreover, a restricted understanding of interspecific reactions (i.e., missing links) is a more serious limitation.
