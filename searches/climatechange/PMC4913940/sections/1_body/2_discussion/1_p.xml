<p class="p">Here, we examined the non-random structural patterns (i.e., nestedness and modularity) of ecological networks based on data collected from several global datasets, and demonstrated that human impacts and climate change affect nestedness and modularity in a range of ecological networks, including food-web, pollination, and seed-dispersal networks. In pollination networks, human impacts were positively correlated with nestedness and negatively correlated with modularity, and modularity declined with temperature-change velocity in seed-dispersal networks. In theory [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], an increase in nestedness and/or decrease in modularity improves ecosystem stability; thus, these results are an indication that mutualistic networks form in such a way as to enhance ecosystem stability against environmental changes or perturbations. Moreover, nestedness increased and modularity decreased in response to temperature-change velocity in food-web networks. Unlike in mutualistic networks, however, decreasing nestedness and/or increasing modularity enhance ecosystem stability in antagonistic networks (i.e., food webs); as such, our results suggest that food-web stability decreases in response to environmental changes.
