<p class="p">In this context, the effects of environmental or external factors on ecological networks are also important. Given that environmental factors can be sources of perturbation (e.g., rainfall, seasonal variation of climate), it would be expected that ecological networks have an optimal structure that maximizes ecosystem stability against such perturbations. Thus, nestedness and modularity change in response to environmental perturbations because they largely determine ecosystem stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The importance of environmental factors are often discussed in the context of ecosystem stability [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]; many previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] have focused on the association between the environment and ecological network structure, with several focusing specifically on the influence of the environment on nestedness/modularity. Several studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] have reported the relationship between climatic parameters and nestedness and modularity in mutualistic networks and food webs; for example, nestedness in pollination networks was found to decrease with annual precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], whereas modularity in seed-dispersal networks increased with temperature seasonality [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], and a positive correlation between modularity and precipitation seasonality was observed in food webs [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], we demonstrated that climate seasonality affects ecological networks, and that the type of climatic seasonality influencing network structure differs among ecosystems; for example, network properties in freshwater ecosystems were mainly affected by rainfall seasonality but primarily by temperature seasonality in terrestrial ecosystems.
