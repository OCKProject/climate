<p class="p">Climate change and human activities are also major sources of environmental perturbations, and given that nestedness and modularity are expected to change in response to environment perturbations, climate change and human impacts are thus also expected to affect ecological network structure. Dalsgaard et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], for instance, reported that modularity and nestedness in pollination networks correlated with the historical rate of warming, and Sebastián-González et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] demonstrated that modularity declined and nestedness increased in seed-dispersal networks in response to human impacts (e.g., human population density, land use, infrastructure development, and so forth). Such results imply that mutualistic networks are flexible and can change in response to climate change and human activities in order to improve ecosystem stability.
