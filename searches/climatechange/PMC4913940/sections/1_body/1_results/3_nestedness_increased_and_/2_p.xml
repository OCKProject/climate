<p class="p">Food-web structure was found to be associated with temperature-change velocity. In particular, nestedness increased as velocity increased (

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>); moreover, modularity decreased in response to velocity when spatial-autocorrelation effects were removed (

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). No relationships were found between human impacts and either nestedness or modularity.
