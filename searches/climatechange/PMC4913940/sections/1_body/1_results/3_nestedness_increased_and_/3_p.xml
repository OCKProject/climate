<p class="p">Current climate also affected both nestedness and modularity (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>); a positive association was found between mean annual temperature and nestedness, whereas a negative association was detected between mean annual temperature and modularity. A positive correlation between modularity and precipitation seasonality was also observed, a result consistent with that of previous research [
