<p class="p">In a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], increasing nestedness and declining modularity owing to temperature-change velocity were only observed for mainland pollination networks; such associations were not conclusive for island pollination networks or the global dataset. As the results presented here were based on global datasets, it is possible that the limited effect of temperature-change velocity on nestedness and modularity is because we differentiated between mainland and island networks. Therefore, we performed similar analyses for both mainland and island networks for reasons of comparison. We found a positive correlation between nestedness and human impacts in mainland networks (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157929.s007" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>) networks. On the other hand, no relationship was detected between temperature-change velocity and nestedness/modularity in either mainland or island networks (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157929.s007" class="xref">S7</xref> Tables). These results suggest that nestedness and modularity in pollination networks are influenced by human impacts rather than temperature-change velocity, a discrepancy that may exist for several reasons (see
