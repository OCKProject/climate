<p class="p">Several geographical and climatic parameters were also factors in determining nestedness and modularity; nestedness decreased with elevation, mean annual temperature, and temperature seasonality, and increased with precipitation seasonality, whereas modularity decreased with temperature seasonality. These results are somewhat consistent with the results of other studies; for example, a negative association between nestedness and temperature seasonality has been previously reported [
