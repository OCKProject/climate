<p class="p">We found no relationship between nestedness and human impacts/temperature-change velocity; moreover, we did not identify any variable explaining nestedness (

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), but no association was observed between human impacts and modularity. These results support the conclusion that environmental changes affect network structure in pollination [

 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] networks; however, they were inconsistent with the results of previous research [
 <xref rid="pone.0157929.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] in which a relationship was detected between human impacts and both nestedness and modularity.
