<p class="p">The electric buses are becoming popular with cities because they have lower operating costs and they improve air quality. Many cities have started to order electric buses. There is the hope that this transformation to electric buses will happen rapidly and that one decade from now more than half of the buses will be electric buses. This will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.</p>
