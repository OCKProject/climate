 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[35]</xref> have reported on the results of an evaluation of the technology of 12 Proterra electric buses in service in California. The energy required was 2.15 kWh/mile (1.34 kWh/km). While the electric motor does not use power when the bus is stopped to pick up passengers, the lighting and air conditioning use power. Maintenance costs were $0.16 /mile ($0.10 /km). Proterra buses are available with different amounts of battery storage up to about 330 kWh. With larger battery packs it is possible to avoid charging during peak power demand times and make greater use of off-peak times to charge the buses. Proterra is a U.S. company with manufacturing in South Carolina.
