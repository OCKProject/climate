<p class="p">Tesla has introduced fast charging with solar panels to generate electricity and battery storage to avoid high demand charges from electric utilities 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. Fast charging is more expensive to install and the cost of the electricity may be more because of demand charges if grid power is used. Public fast charging EVSE is more expensive because of the rate of power flow and the need to work with all customers. Costs as high as $122,000 per charge station have been reported 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref> for the West Coast Electric Highway project that is designed to provide fast charging along I-5 in California, Oregon, and Washington. It may be necessary to charge about $0.20 to $0.25 /kWh for electricity at fast charging stations in order to pay for the capital and operating costs 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref>. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District charges $0.22 /kWh for both level 2 and DC fast charging in their solar parking lot (Personal communication with R. Troute, August 12, 2016). Tesla has provided free charging at its supercharger stations to Tesla owners. With the 200 mile range and supercharger stations, it is possible to travel to most places in the United States in a Tesla EV.
