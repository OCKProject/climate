<p class="p">One of the barriers associated with the deployment of plug-in vehicles is range anxiety because the number of locations to charge EV batteries is limited. The addition of solar powered charging infrastructure has the benefits of reducing range anxiety greening the electrical grid, and providing shaded parking. In Arizona, there are many locations with solar panels and shaded parking where there are no EV charging stations because they were installed before EVs were popular and shade is very beneficial on hot days.</p>
