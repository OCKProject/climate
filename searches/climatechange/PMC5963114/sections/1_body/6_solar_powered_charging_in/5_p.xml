<p class="p">In Kansas, 16 kWh per parking place per day is a good estimate for the electricity generated by solar panels. There are of the order of 800 million parking spaces in the U.S., but not all of them are positioned appropriately for addition of solar panels. With about 200 million parking spaces with solar panels, about 3 billion kWh/day can be generated, which is about equal to the daily electricity requirement to allow most drivers to drive about 13,000 miles/year (21,000 km/year). The annual production of electricity from covering 200 million parking spaces with solar panels is about equal to 1/4 of the electricity production in the USA
