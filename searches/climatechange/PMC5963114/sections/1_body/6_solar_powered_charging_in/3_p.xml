<p class="p">Solar panels can be added to many parking lots to provide shaded parking, and an infrastructure of charging stations can be part of these projects. If 200 million parking spaces are modernized with solar panels and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), about 1/4 of the electricity that is produced today in the USA (2016) can be generated by solar panels over parking lots. Level 1 charging is 110 volt charging with about 2 to 3 kW of power flowing into the EV. This value is about the same as the power produced by solar panels over one parking place

For workplace charging, level 1 charging can provide 16-30 kWh of electricity during a working day, which is sufficient to travel 48–90 miles (77–145 km). Most workers travel less distance than this to come to work. Level 1 EVSE is often supplied with the EV at the time of purchase, so an electrical outlet with power and a 30 amp fuse is what is needed as part of the charging infrastructure in the parking lot. In the National Academies report
