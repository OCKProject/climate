<p class="p">The solar panels can be connected to the local electrical grid such that power can flow into the grid and the grid can provide power for EV charging. Most parking lots with solar panels can have a mix of level 1 and level 2 EVSE. Level 2 charging delivers about 6 kW of power with a 240 volt power supply. The largest battery packs in EVs are about 70 kWh, which means it takes about 10 hours with level 2 charging to add 60 kWh to an EV with a large battery storage capacity. The EVSE for level 2 is normally fixed to the electrical power supply and is part of the charging station. The cost of EVSE for level 2 ranges from about $1200 to $4000; some EVSE includes both level 1 and level 2 charging
