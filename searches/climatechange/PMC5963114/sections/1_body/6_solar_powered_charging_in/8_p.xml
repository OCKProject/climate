<p class="p">One of the developments needed is to standardize the connection to the vehicle for fast charging. Presently there are three different designs that are commonly used: 1. Combined Charging System (CCS) which includes the J1772 Level two charging port and an added port to allow for fast charging; 2. CHAdeMO quick charge standard developed by Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi; and Tesla Supercharger. Tesla has more than 650 locations with Superchargers in the world. There are more than 1500 CHAdeMo level 3 chargers in the U.S. Some sites have both CHAdeMo and CCS equipment available.</p>
