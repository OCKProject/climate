<p class="p">Satish et al. 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[15]</xref> have investigated the effect of carbon dioxide concentration on human decision-making performance. Concentrations of 600, 1000, and 2,500 ppm were used in a work performance environment, and the results showed that performance decreased significantly at the higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Thus, it is expected that the increases in carbon dioxide concentrations with time due to carbon emissions will have a health impact associated with them. The value in the atmosphere is presently about 400 ppm in 2016 and rising. In buildings with human occupants, values of about 600 ppm have been reported
