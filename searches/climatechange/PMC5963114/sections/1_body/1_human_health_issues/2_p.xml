<p class="p">Along with the environmental degradation, there are many human health issues associated with climate change, energy, transportation, and air quality 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>. From the coal mines to coal burning power plants, there are environmental health impacts. Many are associated with air quality. Along with the immediate effects of air pollution, the long term effects of increasing temperatures will also be quite problematic.
