<p class="p">Solar powered charging infrastructure has the potential to increase the availability of charging stations and reduce range anxiety. Costs of solar panels, wind energy, and batteries are decreasing, and this has resulted in increased sales of EVs, and greater numbers of installations of wind farms and solar panels. In 2015, wind power was ranked number 1 and solar power was ranked number 2 for reported new electric generating capacity. The large batteries in EVs can be charged with lower cost electricity when time of use prices is available. The nexus of solar powered charging infrastructure, electric vehicles, and renewable energy has the potential to improve public health by improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions.</p>
