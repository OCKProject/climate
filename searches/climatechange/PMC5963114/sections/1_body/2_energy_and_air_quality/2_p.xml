<p class="p">Combustion of fossil fuels causes short term threats such as air pollution and long term threats like climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide. Coal fired power plants have been an environmental concern because they are a significant source of carbon emissions and health damaging air particulates. Despite the immediate effects they have on the health of surrounding communities, some coal burning power plants are kept in service for more than 50 years. One alternative to coal is natural gas. Natural gas is a cleaner fuel that is used in many power plants that are operated to generate electricity to meet peak power requirements. It emits less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced as compared to coal. Due to the immediate threats of coal combustion, one of the higher priorities is to reduce the use of coal for heating, power generation, and industrial processes.</p>
