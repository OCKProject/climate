  <p class="p">We need to electrify transportation and travel without generating carbon emissions. There are many new challenges to address to electrify all ground transportation.</p>

  <p class="p">We need to improve air quality by reducing pollution associated with carbon emissions. Air quality will be much better if we accomplish 5.1 and 5.2.</p>

  <p class="p">We need to enhance charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. One way to accomplish this is with solar powered charging stations

Workplace charging, fast charging along highways, and charging at other locations are all important. The concept of changing batteries quickly at roadside stations is also a viable alternative.

  <p class="p">We need to expand the infrastructure for safe bicycle transportation. In some places in Europe there are excellent pathways for bicycles. This needs to be extended to other parts of the world.</p>

  <p class="p">We need to improve and electrify public transportation. There are many places in the world where air quality and health would be better if public transportation was powered by electricity rather than diesel fuel. Electric buses are available to replace diesel powered buses.</p>

  <p class="p">We need to modernize the electrical grid. The modernization of the electrical grid with better communication and information is very important to accomplishing some of the goals above.</p>
  <p class="p">There is a need to have real time prices or time of use prices for electricity because wind energy and solar energy need to be used when they are generated or stored for future use. There are several electrical loads that can be shifted in time (washing and drying clothes and charging electric vehicles are examples). A modern electrical grid with good communication features that will allow the effective implementation of time of use prices can be very helpful in efforts to manage an electrical grid with large percentages of wind and solar power generation.</p>

  <p class="p">We need to use electric vehicles to store electricity. The growth in numbers of electric vehicles and the growth in the capacity of EV batteries have the potential to be very helpful to the management of electrical power generation and distribution. If every family had an EV with 50 kWh of battery storage, this would provide storage for more than the present daily use of electricity by a typical family. Daily home use may be about 10 to 20 kWh while transportation use may be 10 to 15 kWh/day (30 to 45 miles/day or 48 to 72 km/day). With many electric vehicles in service, about half the electricity flow from the grid can be shifted in time to off peak times when it is easier and less expensive to supply it.</p>
