<p class="p">The global expenditure for electric power generation, distribution and use is more than $1 trillion/year. One of the most important transitions associated with reducing carbon emissions and improving health is the transition from coal burning power plants to wind and solar production of electricity. Because of advances in technology, wind energy and solar energy are becoming more competitive, and prices of wind and solar power generation have trended downward for the last several years. In 2015 in the U.S. for new power generation capacity, wind was first and solar was second. Lester Brown
