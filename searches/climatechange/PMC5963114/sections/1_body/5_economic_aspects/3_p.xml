<p class="p">Health care costs are a significant portion of national and global expenditures. In the United States, about $3 trillion is spent on health care annually. The global expenditures for health are more than $6 trillion/year 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[17]</xref>. There is the potential to reduce health care costs by reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality at the same time. The potential value of air quality improvements in terms of reduced health care costs and better health in the U.S. are in the range of $37–90 billion/year 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. The American Lung Association in California report 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref> estimates that the harm in 2015 associated with air pollution attributed to passenger vehicles in the ten states of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont was $24 billion for health and $13 billion for climate. In China, health costs associated with air pollution are about 1.2–3.3% of China's gross domestic product 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>,
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[18]</xref>. The social costs of the health impact of outdoor air pollution were about $1.3 trillion/year in 2010 in China and about $0.6 trillion/year in India. This can be compared to $1.7 trillion/year for the 35 OECD countries 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[53]</xref>. The estimated cost of serious health consequences because of particulate matter pollution is about 3% of India’s GDP; 1.7% is from outdoor and 1.3% is from indoor air pollution 
 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[54]</xref>. In India, there are significant health and economic benefits associated with taking action to reduce particulate matter in urban air
