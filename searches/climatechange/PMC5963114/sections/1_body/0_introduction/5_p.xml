 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[22]</xref>. Additional research and development associated with the smart grid, which is important for the transition to wind and solar generated electricity, are needed in order to transition to real time prices for electricity. Electric vehicles have the potential to contribute positively to grid stability when real time prices for electricity are made available and optimized
