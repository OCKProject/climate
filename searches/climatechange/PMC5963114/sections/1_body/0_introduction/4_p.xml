<p class="p">To make transportation truly combustion free in order to decrease air pollution and improve human health, vehicles will need to transition to electric power fueled by emission free renewable energy. Solar powered charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) is one of the transitions that is at the heart of this nexus 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. One way to advance this transition is by covering parking lots with solar panels and adding EV charging infrastructure (also known as EVSEâ€”electric vehicle supply equipment). One added benefit of initiating this method is that the shade provided by the solar panels will have positive effects by decreasing heat related health issues and property damage.
