<p class="p">The Paris Agreement on Climate Change of December 2015 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref> has the potential to benefit all people. At this conference, the United Nations prioritized several goals, including reducing carbon emissions, which are critical to maintaining healthy populations and ecosystems. If these goals can be accomplished quickly, then the rates of change of the anthropogenic effects such as global warming, rising sea levels, and acidification of oceans can be lessened. This will have great value for human health and the environment. The transitions to generate all electricity without carbon emissions and to electrify transportation will take many years and cost trillions of dollars; however, these changes are central to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and reducing the impacts of climate change on human health.
