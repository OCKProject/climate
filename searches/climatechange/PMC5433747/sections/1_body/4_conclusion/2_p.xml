<p class="p">Increasing the ecological realism of models that forecast diversity changes is important, but caution regarding model assumptions is essential [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The addition of dispersal distance differences without considering a trade-off with other life history characteristics introduced unrealistically strong fitness differences between species that might cause us to overestimate extinction risks. Predictions for regional diversity loss from the ecologically more detailed SMSN trade-off scenario were more similar to the simplest assumptions of equal dispersal for all species. However, dispersal capacity did matter for the climate change response of individual species. Large seeded species were more likely to persist through climate change, but developed substantial lags behind their climate niches, possibly causing extinction debts. Small seeded species were more prone to extinction during climate change when facing strong competitive resistance from residents, but also tracked their niches better and underwent adaptive range shifts.
