<p class="p">That trade-offs of the SMSN kind are ubiquitous in nature is likely given the variability of plant strategies that can coexist locally [

While it is unlikely that we could ever measure all of the potentially involved factors simultaneously, it is conceivable that a more realistically parameterised trade-off would decrease fitness differences between species even more, increasing the potential for coexistence of diverging life history strategies [

 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In conjunction with other factors such as spatial or temporal heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], such trade-offs contribute to the maintenance of higher diversity and resilience in metacommunities. If we believe that some general insight can be gained from the simple model presented here, then we might conclude that naturally diverse communities could in fact prove to be more resilient to environmental change than sometimes feared.
