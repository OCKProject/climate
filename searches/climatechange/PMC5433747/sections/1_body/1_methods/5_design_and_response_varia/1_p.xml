<p class="p">The analysis focused on a comparison of regional extinction risk and diversity change due to climate change in the three scenarios, and for different SM distribution parameters. To study the impact of interspecific competition strength, all scenarios were first evaluated for a range of competition levels (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">ij</italic>
 </sub> = [0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]) with constant empirical SM distribution values (SM mean = 1.5 mg, SD = 3) [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. To study the mechanisms causing differences between scenarios, SM distribution parameters (mean and standard deviation) were manipulated in a fully factorial design and evaluated for constant interspecific competition

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">ij</italic>
 </sub> = 0.5. Each parameter combination was replicated 30 times, and the following response variables were calculated: mean local and regional richness, as well as mean alpha, beta and gamma diversity (inverse Simpson’s index; 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>) during stable climates and after climate change. Percent differences of regional richness (i.e. extinctions) and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic> diversity relative to values during stable conditions are the main response variables. Also recorded were the number of successful colonisation events during climate change, defined as new establishment in a patch and persistence during one growing season of species that were not present the year before; competitive exclusion events were defined as local exclusion of species that were present the year before. To study which SM is advantageous in each scenario, the geometric mean SM was recorded, weighted by realised regional abundance distributions. Species’ efficiency in tracking shifting thermal niches was captured by calculating the lag (in °C) behind their thermal niche optimum of the 40 warmest adapted species as well as the correlation of this lag with SM.
