<p class="p">Annual species grow, compete (for space and resources) and die during a yearly growing season where temperature stays constant; species produce and disperse seeds at the end of each growing season according to their current local abundances and a distance-based dispersal kernel (see below). After seed dispersal, all adults die; the starting abundances in the next year are determined from germinating seeds. Abundances are quantified as biomass (B), and the terms are henceforth used interchangeably.</p>
