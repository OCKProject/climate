<p class="p">Dispersal is deterministic, such that the number of seeds arriving in each site at the end of each year is simply the sum of seeds sent out from all sites, multiplied by distance-dependent probability of arrival. Upon arrival, seeds germinate according to their species-specific germination probability. Germinating seeds are converted to biomass based on species-specific seedling biomass, thus creating the starting biomass of all species for the next growing season. Scaling relations between SM, germination probability and seedling biomass are reported in
