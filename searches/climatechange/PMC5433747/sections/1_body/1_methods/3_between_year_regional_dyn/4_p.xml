<p class="p">All boundaries of the landscape are open: seeds dispersing beyond are lost. At the downslope boundary species can additionally immigrate from a regional pool of species adapted to warmer conditions (see Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). This ensures that the competitive environment in the warmer regions of the area remains relatively constant, i.e. there is neither ‘lowland biotic attrition’ (where biodiversity gets eroded due to a lack of replacement by warmer adapted species) nor competitive release (where species could survive indefinitely in the absence of competitors under suboptimal, i.e. too warm, conditions). To implement this, species’

The downslope species pool is located at half an average interpatch distance south from the landscape’s edge. Its abundance-weighted mean (CWM)

  <italic class="italic">opt</italic>
 </sub> distribution is assumed to be normal, with a variance corresponding to the mean variance of communities within the landscape as a function of time. Assuming a downslope community directly below of each patch within the landscape, immigration probability follows the common dispersal kernel. Note that calculations of response variables include ‘native’ species only, i.e. species present at equilibrium after the stable climate run-up phase, in order to follow diversity changes of present assemblages.
