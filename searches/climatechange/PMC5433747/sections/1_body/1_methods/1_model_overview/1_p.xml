<p class="p">The model tracks the dynamics of species abundances (quantified as biomass 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>) in a metacommunity of annual plants. Each species is characterised by two traits: its thermal niche optimum (affecting growth rate) and its seed mass (affecting mean dispersal distance). Patches are distributed randomly in a landscape spanning a temperature gradient of 6°C, corresponding to an elevational gradient of ca. 900 m [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). All patches are first populated with all 200 species at equal initial biomass. Simulations start with a period of stable climate conditions to allow for species sorting according to their thermal niches and competitive interactions until communities reach equilibrium. Then a climate change scenario is imposed where temperatures along the whole gradient increase simultaneously and sigmoidally by 3°C over 150 years, simulating the intermediate IPCC emission scenario RCP 6.0 [
