<p class="p">Competition drove diversity patterns and augmented differences between scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s002" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). Because thermal niche widths were sufficiently broad for all species to survive in the landscape, all species regionally coexisted in the absence of competition. Only competitive exclusion acting on relative fitness differences between species could cause extinctions. Note that the term ‘fitness’ here is used generically to indicate relative fitness differences between species that arise from an interaction of the degree of adaptation to current conditions (match or mismatch between a species’ thermal niche optimum and the experienced temperature) and the efficiency of dispersal and establishment that allows species to track their thermal niche optimum. Where all species have the same seed mass (uniform scenario), relative fitness differences arise only from thermal adaptation.
