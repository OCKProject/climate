<p class="p">Increased competition had the strongest effect in the 
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal</italic> scenario, where it lowered regional richness and evenness (

 <italic class="italic">’kernel effect’</italic>: Decreasing the mean dispersal distance (with increasing seed mass) not only reduces distances that can be reached but at the same time increases local deposition probability (see Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). In the variable dispersal scenario, this caused a strong competitive advantage for large seeded species and decreased regional diversity relative to other scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s002" class="xref">S1D Fig</xref>). While large seeds could not disperse far, once established they locally deposited more seeds than smaller seeded species, leading to higher initial biomass and a competitive advantage of larger seeded species. Local pre-emptive dominance of large seeded species (due to positive density dependence) influenced regional species distribution patterns more than dispersal between patches.
