<p class="p">Higher equilibrium species richness and diversity in the trade-off as compared to the variable dispersal scenario already provided a crucial initial buffer against diversity loss from climate change. Higher initial levels of coexistence maintained the response diversity in SM (dispersal capacity) that would facilitate regional re-organisation in response to climate change.</p>
