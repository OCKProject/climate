<p class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">trade-off scenario</italic>, this pattern of increased dominance of fewer species was less pronounced. The SMSN trade-off reduced the fitness differences introduced by the kernel effect, in spite of higher seedling biomass of larger seeded species in the trade-off scenario. Greater seed number compensated (partly) for the lower local deposition probability that came with larger mean distances. An establishment-colonisation trade-off maintained higher levels of species coexistence. Local and regional diversity remained higher (
