<p class="p">The lag of species in tracking their climate optimum was lowest in communities with small SM means, where most species dispersed well. In communities with large SM means, species were not able to track their niche via dispersal and stayed far behind their optimum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). Climate tracking was worse in the 
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal scenario</italic>, because here species seldom succeeded in colonisation of new patches due to resistance from large seeded local residents. This also caused a negative correlation of the magnitude of the climate lag with SM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>): here, it was the largest seeded species that were able to track their niche optimum most closely, via local shifts in abundances of species that persisted throughout climate change. This is strong evidence that a persistence mechanism, and not regional dispersal, provided the only means of community adaptation in the variable dispersal scenario, despite the presence of good dispersers. In the 
 <italic class="italic">trade-off scenario</italic> on the other hand, dispersal and colonisation events enabled species to track their optima more closely (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). The lag and seed mass were correlated positively in most of parameter space (i.e. larger seeds had a larger lag), indicating the importance of small seeds and dispersal for the ability of species to track their shifting environmental niche optima through space (
