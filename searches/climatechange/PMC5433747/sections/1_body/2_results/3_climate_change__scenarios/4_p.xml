<p class="p">The number of successful colonisation events was greater with differences in dispersal (
 <italic class="italic">variable scenario</italic>) than in the 
 <italic class="italic">uniform scenario</italic>, owing to the presence of better dispersers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). Under 
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal</italic> assumptions, however, competition depressed the number of successful colonisations much more strongly than in the trade-off scenario. Local competitive resistance to colonisation from large seeded resident species was strong due to the kernel effect, and few species managed to invade new patches. In the 
 <italic class="italic">trade-off scenario</italic>, small seeded species countered the strong local dominance of large seeded species with a denser seed rain (higher fecundity) that allowed them to successfully invade communities. Additionally, generally higher levels of evenness facilitated colonisation events and thus amplified local diversity in a feedback loop. Escape and re-establishment of competitively inferior species caused higher levels of local exclusion events in the trade-off scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g001" class="xref">Fig 1D</xref>) without loss of regional diversity.
