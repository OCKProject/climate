<p class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">uniform scenario</italic>, dispersal capacity (SM mean) had no effect on extinction risk, which was overall comparatively low. Small relative fitness differences here maintained fairly high levels of coexistence (

 <italic class="italic">Î³</italic> diversity). For larger SM, where regional dispersal was less efficient but local deposition probability was higher, local persistence and relative shifts in abundance according to thermal optima dominated, with a relatively lower loss of regional diversity (
