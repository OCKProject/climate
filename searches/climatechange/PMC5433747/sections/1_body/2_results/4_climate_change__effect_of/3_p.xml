<p class="p">Strong relative fitness differences in the 
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal scenario</italic> (the kernel effect) resulted in the highest levels of extinction and diversity loss during climate change. More species went extinct with lower SM means and higher SM variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). For these communities, most species dispersed far (beta diversity stayed low) and were able to track their optimum niche better than in the uniform scenario. This increased regional competition for thermal niches, thereby causing extinctions. In the variable dispersal scenario, resistance to colonisation from established species was strong and the few largest seeded species suppressed and excluded their competitors. With high SM variation, regional diversity loss was weaker than under uniform dispersal as species had broader ranges and patches remained more similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). With larger SM means and lower variation, local persistence maintained relatively high species numbers, even for species outside their optimal ranges, but diversity loss was greater. Dispersal dynamics were less prevalent here. Instead, shifts in relative abundances of species present before climate change caused a decrease in evenness. The largest seeded species came to dominate (
