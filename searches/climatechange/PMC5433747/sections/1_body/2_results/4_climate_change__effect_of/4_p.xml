Most extinctions occurred with small SM means and increasing variation, where many good dispersers tracked their shifting niches and competed in the colonisation of new patches. Much higher levels of coexistence than in the variable dispersal scenario were maintained for increasing SM means and variation. Diversity remained relatively high (only decreasing somewhat for the largest SM means and lower SM variation, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002" class="xref">Fig 2E</xref>), but here persistence and competitive dominance of large seeded species prevailed instead of the dispersal driven dynamics with smaller means and higher variability. Nonetheless, a combination of dispersal and persistence appeared to maintain higher levels of diversity over much of parameter space. The trade-off essentially reduced and equalised the fitness differences introduced by the kernel effect. Due to higher fecundity (SN), smaller seeded species more often succeeded in colonising new patches in spite of competitive resistance from residents. The superiority of large seeds in the variable dispersal scenario was balanced by the trade-off to a degree where the mean of a given SM distribution was selected for (
