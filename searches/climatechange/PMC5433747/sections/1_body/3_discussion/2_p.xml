<p class="p">The present study shows that assumptions about competition and dispersal differences strongly affect model predictions of regional diversity loss and extinction risk. Differences in species dispersal capacity (variable dispersal scenario) predicted much stronger species and diversity loss than uniform dispersal, corroborating results of Urban et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Introducing an empirically based trade-off between dispersal capacity and other demographic rates however, buffered this effect to a large degree, raising the question of required and appropriate levels of model complexity.
