<p class="p">Competition in the present model was the driver of all species extinctions. Because species had thermal niches that were broad enough to allow persistence even after climate change, only competitive interactions could cause local or regional exclusion and extinction. Competition caused species and diversity loss by a number of mechanisms: i) depression of population abundances and local evenness, which increases extinction risk, ii) competitive exclusion of species that could persist in the absence of competitors, iii) pre-emptive dominance of local residents that poses competitive resistance to colonisation, which slows down range shifts and can cause extinctions [
