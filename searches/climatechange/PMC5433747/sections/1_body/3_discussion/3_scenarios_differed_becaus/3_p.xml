<p class="p">Adding differences in dispersal capacity (
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal scenario</italic>) immediately introduced unexpectedly strong differences in relative fitness between species, akin to a colonisation-competition trade-off [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Stronger competition here had the greatest negative effect on regional coexistence and diversity and caused the most extinctions during climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). This reproduces results of the one other study that modelled effects of variation in dispersal capacity on community climate change responses under multispecies competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, the mechanism causing this pattern here was found to be a different one. Urban et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] interpreted their results as caused by better dispersers that outrun worse dispersers in the pursuit of their shifting niches, to then outcompete them. By studying the regional abundance weighted mean seed mass and the correlation between seed mass and climate tracking, I clearly show that here a different mechanism caused the strong diversity declines in this scenario. Specifically, bad dispersers with large seed mass were selected for due to a strong local competitive advantage that enabled maladapted species to persist via pre-emptive dominance and cause resistance to colonisation from good dispersers. As a consequence, good dispersers were least able to track their shifting niches (negative correlation between SM and lag in climate tracking, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Local compensatory dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], not dispersal, determined community responses to climate change. This situation corresponds to the ‘boxcar effect’ described by Urban et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], where species can only expand their ranges northwards once local competitors are weakened enough to allow colonisation. Yet the pattern was caused solely by the kernel effect: lowering the mean dispersal distance of a species decreases not only the maximum distance that can be reached but also greatly increases the probability of local deposition. The kernel effect is particularly strong for the exponential power kernel used here, which can overestimate local seed deposition [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Nonetheless it is implicit in the mathematics of a range of different dispersal kernels, and should be kept in mind when manipulating mean dispersal distances.
