<p class="p">With equal dispersal capacities (
 <italic class="italic">uniform scenario</italic>), competitive differences between species arose solely from indirect effects of local climates on species growth rates. Species sorting was according to thermal optima only. The uniform scenario thus established effects of competition due to thermal niche differentiation and competitive exclusion of maladapted species. Some competitive resistance to colonisation occurred, but when all species had high dispersal capacity and hence relatively low local deposition probabilities, the pre-emptive dominance of resident species was weak and colonisation by better adapted species could occur.
