<p class="p">Dispersal and the seed shadow were also much simplified here, although the selected kernel was chosen to fit empirical data well [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. This leptokurtic kernel has the advantage of capturing long distance dispersal, but could overestimate local deposition probabilities [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Adaptations for different dispersal vectors (e.g. wind, water, animals) and the possibility that multiple vectors sequentially contribute to dispersal further modify species’ mean dispersal distances and complicate accurate modelling of the seed shadow [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Spatiotemporal availability of suitable vectors then becomes another factor in species’ capacity for range shifts [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. For wind dispersal, release height of seeds and falling velocity are probably stronger predictors of dispersal distance than seed mass [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], although terminal velocity tends to positively correlate with seed mass [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>].
