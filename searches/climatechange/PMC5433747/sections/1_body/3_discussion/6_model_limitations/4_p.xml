<p class="p">The spatial and temporal scales at which trade-off elements play out are also relevant for coexistence and community responses to changing conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Local and regional spatial heterogeneity in e.g. habitat quality, as well as the spatial arrangement of patches, will affect the link between dispersal strategies and coexistence. Habitat fragmentation is a ubiquitous problem, and the degree of spatial aggregation of patches vs. corridors and stepping stones can affect species range shifts [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The strength of interspecific competition, determining the speed of competitive exclusion, will interact with the velocity and variability of local manifestations of climate change. The choice to focus on annual species only was an unrealistic simplification, and coexistence with perennial species as well as soil seed bank dynamics would alter the timescales at which recruitment and competition play out. The relative importance of these factors could be explored by extending the presented model.
