<p class="p">For communities with larger SM means and low variability, richness and diversity were maintained by a 
 <italic class="italic">persistence mechanism</italic>: large seeded species, once established, were able to maintain high population abundances even when environmental conditions become suboptimal. A pre-emptive effect of high abundances ensured their local dominance and competitive superiority, largely due to the kernel effect. Communities changed only due to shifts in relative abundances of species present before climate change, not due to colonisation of new species. Ultimately, this creates an extinction debt [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], and in the long run, these species might decline further unless they are able to adapt. Such transient persistence of remnant populations in spite of an increasing mismatch with changing conditions has been predicted for alpine plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], and is particularly worrying as it may cause an underestimation of climate change effects and future extinction risks.
