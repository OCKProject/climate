<p class="p">Two mechanisms mediated the metacommunity response to climate change, but their relative importance depended on the community seed mass distribution (the combination of the seed mass distribution mean and variability (SD)). For small means and increasing variability, a 
 <italic class="italic">spatial mechanism</italic> was at play that enabled true range shifts. Extinction risk during CC was highest here, mainly for the smallest seeded species, but evenness (diversity) also remained high due to spatial dynamics: dispersal was efficient enough in most species for high rates of colonisation and a regional rescue effect during climate change. Species in such communities were better at tracking their optimum climate, exhibiting the lowest lags. In the variable dispersal scenario, however, these dynamics were strongly impaired by the local dominance of large-seeded species that resisted colonisation (
