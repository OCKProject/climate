<p class="p">The fitness equalising power of the implemented trade-off was surprising, as larger seeded species here had the additional advantage of higher emergence probability and greater initial seedling biomass, on top of higher local deposition probabilities due to the kernel effect. Nonetheless, these advantages were compensated by the higher fecundity and greater seed numbers of smaller seeded species, which could survive via a regional rescue effect. Under climate change, this preserved higher richness and diversity. Model results thus confirm that life history trade-offs involving seed mass underlie a coexistence mechanism based on an establishment-colonisation trade-off [

Coexistence mechanisms that maintain diversity under stable conditions here are shown to be important also for community responses to future environmental change. Understanding and modelling such mechanisms in terms of functional traits has great potential to improve forecasts of future biodiversity change [
