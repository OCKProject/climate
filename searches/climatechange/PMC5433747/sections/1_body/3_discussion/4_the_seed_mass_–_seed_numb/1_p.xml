<p class="p">Variation in seed mass in the variable dispersal scenario caused a bias towards competitive superiority of larger seeds due to the kernel effect, such that coexistence and resilience under changing conditions were severely impaired. The modifying addition of the SMSN trade-off in the

The trade-off between seed mass and seed number had an equalising effect [
