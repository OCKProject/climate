<p class="p">Higher initial species richness and diversity in the trade-off than the variable dispersal scenario already provided for higher response diversity of dispersal capacities, which conferred resilience to the metacommunity and contributed to less loss under climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The SMSN tradeoff enabled coexistence and higher levels of evenness in a much wider region of parameter space. Competitive dominance of large seeds was broken by the seed mass-seed number trade-off, and small seeded species were able to track their thermal niches during climate change, when their advantage in dispersal capacity could play out.
