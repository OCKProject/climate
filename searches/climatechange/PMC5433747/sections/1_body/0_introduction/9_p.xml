<p class="p">Competition-colonisation trade-offs were the initial theoretical formulation for a spatial coexistence mechanism based on these patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], but have been criticised for the unrealistic requirement of strict competitive hierarchies [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. More recently, the coexistence mechanism has been conceptualised as establishment-colonisation trade-off, acting on the tension between selection for larger seeds due to higher emergence and establishment success and selection for smaller seeds due to higher colonisation rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. As underlying cause of this pattern, a tolerance-fecundity trade-off has been proposed, where large seeds have higher establishment success due to greater stress tolerance, while small seeds are advantageous in colonisation due to their greater numbers [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The concept is corroborated by results from a dataset on 50 co-occurring grassland species from Jakobsson and Eriksson [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], where higher emergence probability and greater seedling biomass of larger seeds led to greater recruitment success, while smaller seeds had access to a larger number of recruitment opportunities due to greater seed numbers [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. I use this dataset to parameterise the SMSN trade-off scenario in the present model. Assuming that dispersal capacity is related to seed mass [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], I exploit this established seed mass-seed number trade-off to examine its effect on model predictions.
