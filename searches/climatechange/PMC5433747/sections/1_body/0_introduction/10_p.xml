<p class="p">The model simulates dynamics of a metacommunity of annual plants along a warming climatic gradient, where each species is characterised by its thermal niche optimum and seed mass (determining mean dispersal distance). It is used to address the following questions: (1) Do assumptions about dispersal (three scenarios) affect predicted changes in extinction risk and regional diversity?, (2) Does the effect of competition differ under differing assumptions regarding dispersal?, and (3) What are the mechanisms that cause differences in model outcomes and how do they depend on the seed mass distribution of the community?</p>
