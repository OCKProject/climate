<p class="p">The most widely used method to estimate species range shifts in response to climate change is correlative species distribution modelling (SDM) which interprets the current observed range as a species’ bioclimatic niche and projects this range to future, altered climate conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]), traditional SDMs remain popular due to low data requirements and relative ease of use. To better select the appropriate level of model complexity, we need to understand which factors have the largest impact on modelling outcomes and which can potentially be ignored [
