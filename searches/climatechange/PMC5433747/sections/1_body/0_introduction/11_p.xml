<p class="p">Dispersal assumptions are examined using three scenarios of increasing ecological realism: (i) a 
 <italic class="italic">uniform dispersal</italic> scenario, where all species have the same dispersal capacity and vital rates, (ii) a 
 <italic class="italic">variable dispersal</italic> scenario, where species differ in dispersal capacity but have equal other vital rates, and (iii) a SMSN 
 <italic class="italic">trade-off scenario</italic> where differences in dispersal capacity between species trade off with fecundity, establishment probability, and seedling biomass. Dispersal capacity and trade-offs are based on observed seed mass distributions and empirical relationships with seed mass. Scenarios are examined for different strengths of interspecific competition and for varying seed mass (SM) distribution parameters (mean and standard deviation).
