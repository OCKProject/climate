<p class="p">Theoretical models can be deployed to compare assumptions, study mechanisms and generate hypotheses. Here, I use a simple metacommunity simulation model to study the effect of assumptions about species interactions (the strength of interspecific competition) and dispersal ability on model predictions regarding species range shifts, extinction risk and diversity loss following climate change. Model assumptions are formulated based on functional traits, allowing to include detailed yet general ecological characteristics.</p>
