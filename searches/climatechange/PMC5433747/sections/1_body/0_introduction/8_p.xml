<p class="p">The mechanism by which the seed massâ€”seed number (SMSN) trade-off enables coexistence is still debated [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], but there is evidence for a range of relationships of seed mass with demographic rates. Small seeded species produce more seeds and gain a numerical advantage during colonisation [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], and also may disperse farther [
 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], thus reaching more sites. Large seeded species have been suggested to have higher emergence probability [
