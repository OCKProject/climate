<p class="p">One aim is to highlight the utility of known variation and covariation in life history traits for model development. Modelling species niches based on traits can investigate effects of increased ecological realism without loosing generality [

 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In such mechanistic models, population processes such as growth or reproduction are linked explicitly to the abiotic and biotic environment via traits that affect species fitness as a function of the environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Species niches and ranges thus emerge from first principles, i.e. trait-based fitness functions that can simulate both species sorting (environmental filtering) and limiting similarity (competitive exclusion). Importantly, known covariation and trade-offs between traits that combine to constitute the life history strategy of species can be used to guide and formulate model assumptions.
