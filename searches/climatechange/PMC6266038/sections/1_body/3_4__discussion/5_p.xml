<p class="p">In the aftermath of an extreme weather event, access to food can have an important role in maintaining or enhancing social cohesion [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. While more studies are needed to better understand the factors involved, social cohesion can foster quicker recovery in the aftermath of an extreme weather event. These findings suggest that cities need to prioritize planning for neighborhoods most vulnerable to extreme weather events, taking into account vulnerable populations, where food access could be severely constrained for an extended period of time. Developing local community food resilience action plans and food emergency response plans in neighbourhoods with critical food access issues can help address food insecurity and increase the communityâ€™s emergency food preparedness, response and recovery.
