 <italic class="italic">Food Access in Vulnerable Neighbourhoods</italic>: Food access in 22 of Torontoâ€™s neighbourhoods is disproportionately at risk from extreme weather events because of limited and vulnerable food retail stores. Seven of the 22 neighbourhoods are at greatest risk for limited food access after an extreme weather event because they also have higher rates of food insecurity. In some of these neighbourhoods, vulnerable populations living in older high-rises could be significantly impacted, particularly people with low mobility.
