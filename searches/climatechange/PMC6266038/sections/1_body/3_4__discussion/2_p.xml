 <italic class="italic">Flooding</italic>: The impact of an extreme rain event is the least well understood compared to extreme heat and an ice storm. Only riverine flooding was included in our analysis because “urban flooding” has not yet been fully modelled for the city. Given the research to date, however, river and urban flooding pose the greatest risk of the three extreme weather events studied for the food system. Urban flooding is a recognized risk in Toronto that affects areas outside of the riverine flood plains. Better understanding the areas at risk of urban flooding would contribute to better risk mitigation and emergency response plans.
