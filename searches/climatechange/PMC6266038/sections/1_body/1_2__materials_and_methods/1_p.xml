<p class="p">Three complementary frameworks were used to shape the methodology: ICIC’s Framework for Analyzing Urban Food System Resilience, the Ontario Climate Change and Health Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment Guidelines, and the City of Toronto’s High-Level Risk Assessment (HLRA) Tool. Three extreme weather events were analyzed: (1) flooding from an extreme rainfall event of 100 mm in less than 1 day; (2) a heat wave with 3 or more consecutive days when the maximum temperature is 35 degrees Celsius or higher; and (3) an ice storm causing 30 mm of ice. Toronto has already experienced each of these extreme weather events, and they are expected to become more frequent and severe in the future [
