 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02344" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. The food system is an interconnected system, meaning its functioning depends upon the performance of numerous other systems in a city. The most critical interdependencies include public transportation; the road network; the electrical power system; telecommunications; and the fuel supply transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure. These were incorporated into the analysis. In addition, the analysis also explored the prevalence of risk management tools (business continuity plans and insurance) being used by private-sector food companies and non-profit organizations to manage some of the risks of extreme weather events. Finally, the analysis included Torontoâ€™s municipal policies and procedures that could affect food system recovery.
