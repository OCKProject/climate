In addition, three larger rivers, the Humber River, the Don River, and the Rouge River, as well as numerous other smaller rivers and streams, run through the city and into Lake Ontario. A few areas in the city are prone to river-based (or riverine) flooding. A greater potential risk facing the city is “urban flooding,” also known as pluvial or overland flooding, which happens when extreme rainfall overwhelms sewer systems or when there is major overland water flow in low-lying areas [
