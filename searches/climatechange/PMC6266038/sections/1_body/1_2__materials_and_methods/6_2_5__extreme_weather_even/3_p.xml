 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. For this analysis, we assumed a heat wave with 3 or more consecutive days when the maximum temperature is 35 degrees Celsius or higher, as maximum temperatures in Toronto can exceed 35 degrees Celsius currently and the number of days when the maximum temperature is 35 degrees Celsius or higher is projected to increase because of climate change [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Ice storms are freezing rain events that form a coating of ice on the ground and on exposed objects [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. We assumed an ice storm causing 30 mm of ice because Toronto has already experienced a similar event in December 2013 [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Since both heat waves and ice storms tend to be regional events, for the analysis it was assumed that anything located in Toronto or the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is at risk for these extreme weather events.
