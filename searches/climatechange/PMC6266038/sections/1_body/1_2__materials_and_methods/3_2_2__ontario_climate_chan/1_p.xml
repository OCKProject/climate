<p class="p">The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care developed the Ontario Climate Change and Health Vulnerability and Adaptation (V&amp;A) Assessment Guidelines in 2016 to provide public health units across Ontario with a practical toolkit for conducting comprehensive vulnerability and adaptation assessments to climate change risks [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02344" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The primary objectives of the V&amp;A assessment guidelines are to understand the current and projected future public health risks of climate change and to identify and develop policies and programs to increase resilience to these risks. The structure of the V&amp;A guidelines are designed to be flexible and can be tailored to the circumstances of the assessment.
