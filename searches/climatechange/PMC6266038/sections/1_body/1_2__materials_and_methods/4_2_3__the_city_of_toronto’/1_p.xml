<p class="p">The City of Toronto’s High-Level Risk Assessment (HLRA) tool is used to solicit input from a diverse group of key stakeholders through a structured workshop. This tool represents a distillation of Toronto’s more complex and in depth Climate Risk Assessment Tool, which was originally developed to mirror the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 37000 Risk Management standard. The City of Toronto developed the HLRA tool to help implement its Climate Change Risk Management Policy, which was designed to evaluate the ability of the city’s infrastructure to accommodate extreme weather events. As of 2017, the HLRA tool had been used to assess the resilience of three different “Thematic Areas”: utilities, transportation and water.</p>
