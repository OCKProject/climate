<p class="p">The first step in the neighbourhood vulnerability analysis was to identify neighbourhoods where the share of population classified as low income is greater than the city average. This analysis reveals that 11 of the 22 vulnerable food retail neighbourhoods include a greater share of residents living on low-income than the city average. Within this set of 11 neighbourhoods, seven neighbourhoods have higher social assistance rates than the city average. This set of seven neighbourhoods are at greatest risk for limited food access after an extreme weather event because they have higher rates of food retail vulnerability and food insecurity. All of the seven neighbourhoods are in the inner suburbs, an area of Toronto that has experienced increased population growth, declining average income levels, and increased demand on food banks over the past decade.</p>
