<p class="p">This study identified several climate-related vulnerabilities of the food system in Toronto, but also more broadly adds to the growing body of research on urban resilience. It shows the importance of analyzing and addressing vulnerabilities in the food system related not only directly to climate change, but also to extreme weather events that are likely to become more intense and frequent with climate change. Very few studies have explored food system resilience and fewer still have integrated a public health perspective that includes food insecurity and food safety issues. A body of research already exists that analyzes food safety issues that arise from extreme weather events, such as water contamination and foodborne disease outbreaks from improper food storage and unsafe food preparation during power outages; however, this work has not yet been integrated into food system resilience studies. A deeper integration is warranted, but beyond the scope of this study. The methodology and insights from this study are relevant for cities globally, but more comparative research needs to be done across different urban food systems.</p>
