<p class="p">In this paper, we present the results from the vulnerability assessment of the city of Toronto’s food system to three extreme weather events. To complete the vulnerability assessment, we analyzed public and proprietary data, conducted interviews with 49 individuals, and facilitated a workshop with 23 stakeholders representing various aspects of Toronto’s food system. The analysis reveals that while certain aspects of Toronto’s food system would be quite resilient to extreme weather events, a concerted effort across the food system is needed to address five critical vulnerabilities.</p>
