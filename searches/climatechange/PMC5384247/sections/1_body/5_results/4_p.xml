 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = 3.36 years seems to empirically correspond to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal, which has a period range of within 3 to 6 years. ENSO is arguably the most important global climate pattern and the dominant mode of climate variability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. The effect of ENSO on climate in Europe has been studied intensively using both models and observational or proxy data e.g. refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, and a consistent and statistically significant ENSO signal on the European climate has been found e.g. refs
