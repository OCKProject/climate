<p class="p">The peak L
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> = 22.6 years is coincident with the Hale sunspot cycle. This result partly agrees with some of the conclusions of Yang16. Solar variability has been shown to be a major driver of climate in central Europe during the past two millennia using Δ
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C records. Furthermore, this result is essentially in good agreement with the findings of Scafetta e.g. refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>, who found that the climate system was mostly characterized by a specific set of oscillations and these oscillations (61, 115, 130 and 983 years) appeared to be synchronous with major astronomical oscillations (solar system, solar activity and long solar/lunar tidal cycles).
