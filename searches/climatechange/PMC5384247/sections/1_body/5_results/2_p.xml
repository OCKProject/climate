<p class="p">Next, by using the wavelet transformation technique
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>, we analyzed the scale structure of the constructed driving force and the corresponding physical meaning. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref> shows the local wavelet power spectrum of the driving force output using the Morlet wavelet. As can be seen, there are some major spectral scales, which occur on decadal to centennial time scales.
