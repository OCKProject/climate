 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> shows the variation of the individual scale components (S

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) from band-pass filtering, which indicates the features of the driving forces in the time domain. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> indicates that all the signals are all strongly amplitude and phase modulated. The band-pass filters for the decomposed scale components, termed S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> to S
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> from low to high frequency, were modulated in amplitude, suggesting that these signals are modulated by other signals with longer timescales. For fitting the envelopes of each filtered signal, the modulating signals, named M
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> to M
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>, are presented using sine functions. The modulating signals can be approximately expressed as:
