<p class="p">To show the detailed characteristics of each spectral band based on the wavelet analysis of the driving force output, the time-averaged power spectrum of the driving forces is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. There are several spectral bands and the characteristic periods occur as spectrum peaks (red dots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) at 3.36, 7.5, 14.5, 22.6, 67.7, 90.4, 113.9 and 215 years, named L
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> to L
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>, respectively. The blue dotted line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> is the 95% confidence level, and all scales pass the confidence test at the 95% level.
