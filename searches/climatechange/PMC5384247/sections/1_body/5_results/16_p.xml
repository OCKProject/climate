 <sub class="sub">1000</sub>. It is noted that all the modulating signals M
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> to M
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> have an oscillation period of about 1000 years and the amplitudes appear to increase with increasing frequency. The time phase of the zero amplitude of the modulating signal, specifically the year 1925 in 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1000</sub>, is of particular interest, and is called the ‘zero phase point’. It denotes the point at which the driving forces change from decreasing to increasing. All the modulating amplitude signals that are connected to the millennial scale, suggest that the recent global warming process intensified from 1925 onwards. In particular, it is noted that modulations M
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and M
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> have segmented structures, and modulations M
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> and M
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> have a hierarchical structure with a scale of 250 years in M
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> and 420 years in M
 <sub class="sub">7</sub>. The modulating signal of S
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> has a more complex structure, which contains multiple modes (420 years and 140 years) connected under 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1000</sub>.
