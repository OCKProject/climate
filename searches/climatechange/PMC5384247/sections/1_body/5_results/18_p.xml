<p class="p">This result differs from the conclusions in Scafettaâ€™s papers[e.g. refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>], where this millennial period scale (983 years in his papers) is regarded as a harmonic of the solar cycle, but here we prefer to regard it as the GHG signal for the physical energy of the climate system.
