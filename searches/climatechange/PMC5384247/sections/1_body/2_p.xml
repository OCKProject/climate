<p class="p">The second technique is to directly extract the driving force information behind the observational data. For example, cross-prediction error
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> and slow feature analysis (SFA)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> have been successfully applied to extract slowly changing driving forces from non-stationary time series. To evaluate SFA, a modified logistic map has been used to test the ability of SFA to construct the driving forces from an observational time series, and the results showed that there is a good agreement between the constructed and the true driving forces with a correlation coefficient of 0.998
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. This suggests that SFA is suitable for extracting the driving force from observational time series.
