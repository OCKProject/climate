Annual health examinations should be regularly performed to screen and identify early signs of CVD, cancer, metabolic diseases, and others. The agenda should also include research support to provide relevant data and how to develop early warning systems for CDs as well as systems that can track trends of NCDs. Finally, professional organizations and other nongovernmental groups have a major role to educate their members and the community.</p>
