<p class="p">A brief comment on climate change and its expected influence on CDs and NCDs will justify current and future concerns. The impact of the environment on vector-borne and water-borne diseases is not difficult to explain:[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] (a) Vectors for diseases such as malaria and many emerging infections (such as dengue fever and chikungunya) need a water source. Predictable rainfall favors seasonal and stable transmission, influences susceptibility, acquisition of immunity, and allows community preparedness to avoid major outbreaks. Water shortages, bouts of drought, and unpredictable rainfall create environments that change vector habitat dependence of these vectors on the human host for survival. A recent, on-going, outbreak in Brazil and other South American countries provides a contemporary example of climate change and a serious outcome from a conventionally transmitted infectious disease.[

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] Zika virus (a mosquito-borne

It is hypothesized that water shortages in Brazil may have contributed to the vector (

 <italic class="italic">Aedes ssp</italic>.) preponderance in water reservoirs within human dwellings in the urban settings. (b) Climate changes can also lead to water shortages or floods and thus create insanitary environments leading to outbreaks of cholera and other water-related epidemics.[
