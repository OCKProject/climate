<p class="p">The conference on climate change (21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> session of the Conference of the Parties [COP] and the 11
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> session of the COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol) was recently concluded in Paris, France during the period November 30â€“December 11, 2015, and the outcomes are now available.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] An important question is what can we do as individuals, communities, and governments in the region of North Africa and the Middle East? More specifically, what is the public health agenda and how is climate change linked to health in this region? The term "climate change" is more appropriate than "global warming" and reflects the uncertain patterns of weather conditions from severe heat waves and drought to unpredictable storms and floods depending on geographic areas mostly affected.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] The biophysical processes that underlie these geographic changes have been described and documented[

 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] even though consensus is lacking among groups of scientists, policy makers, and governments about the causes and potential impacts.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] Therefore, highlighting the link between global climate change and health outcomes in the region of North Africa and the Middle East would be timely. In this report, the association of climate change with communicable (CDs) and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is briefly discussed, and few ideas are presented for further consideration in response to this emerging challenge. More targeted research is encouraged.
