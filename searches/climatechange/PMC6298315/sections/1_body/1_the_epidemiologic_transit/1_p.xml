<p class="p">An important achievement has been the substantial increase in adult life expectancy for men and women in countries of the developing world (including North Africa and the Middle East) due to control of communicable diseases (CDs), better nutrition, and advances in medical care. In parallel, however, there have been increases in morbidity and mortality associated with NCDs. The epidemiologic and demographic transition characteristics of the populations of the developing world have been well-described.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] Countries in North Africa and the Middle East are most likely in a mixed transition where both CDs and NCDs coexist but with a rising trend of NCDs. These countries have different generations of populations with potentially varying intrinsic biological, social characteristics and diverse external exposures. More recently, technological factors that lead to rapid cultural diffusion[
