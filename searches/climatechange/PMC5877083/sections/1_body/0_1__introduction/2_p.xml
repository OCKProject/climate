<p class="p">Disasters increase mortality and morbidity rates, including health impacts such as injury, toxic exposure, disease, and mental health, among others [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These impacts are well documented, as are the potential pathways and endpoints for climate change impacts on health. Climate change may trigger increased morbidity and mortality, as a result of climate-sensitive diseases, extreme weather events, increasing non-communicable diseases, and exacerbating existing health problems [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The complex interactions of both climate change and disasters with social, environmental and biological factors on individual and systems levels make their health impacts difficult to measure [

 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The true extent of health impacts of disasters is often underrepresented due to the reliance on mortality rates as indicators of health impacts, complexity of interactions leading to health impacts, and challenges in collecting data during, and in the aftermath of, disaster events [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Similarly, health impacts of climate change are notably difficult to measure due to the time and spatial scales over which health impacts arise, the complex pathways that involve both ecosystems and human systems, numerous stakeholder groups involved in coordinating and collecting data, as well as limited baseline data [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Not only are there commonalities in the current and potential impacts on health, there are overlaps in the different pathways through which these impacts occur.
