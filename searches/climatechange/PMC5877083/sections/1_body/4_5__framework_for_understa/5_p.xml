<p class="p">In addition to the commonalities identified here between in the indirect and direct health impact pathways, there are of course important differences in these pathways. First, the impacts from climate-sensitive disasters and climate change may occur over different time scales ranging from acute events such as typhoons, to slow onset disasters such as sea level rise and droughts exacerbated by climate change [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Second, the spatial scales over which health impacts arise may differ, for example climate change can alter the geographic distribution of climate-sensitive diseases [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], whereas climate-sensitive disasters such as a tropical storm are location specific [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Third, not all disasters are climate change related, just as not all climate change impacts on health are the result of disasters. Disasters caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are classified as geophysical hazards and distinguished from those known to be caused by climate-sensitive hazards. However, the authors acknowledge that these hazards also result in direct and indirect health impacts. Likewise, anthropogenic disasters such as terrorist attacks and conflict are distinguished from climate-sensitive hazards. Similarly, not all climate change impacts on health are related to disasters. This includes health impacts from some slow-onset hazards such as health risks from salinization of drinking water resulting from sea level rise not linked to storm surge [
 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. However, these hazards and their associated direct and indirect health impact pathways are not captured in this framework as this is outside of its intended scope.
