<p class="p">Indirect health impacts of disasters can result from unmet primary healthcare needs after a disaster due to the change in healthcare demands, and reduced capacity of the health system to meet these needs and baseline healthcare needs (for example, prenatal care, chronic disease management, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. These impacts are also a result of the loss of “normal living conditions” [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] (such as adequate and appropriate shelter), and degradation of “environmental health safeguards” [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and health-determining sectors and infrastructure that populations and health systems rely on (such as clean water, sanitation, waste management, electricity, etc.) [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. For example, outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases may occur after a disaster or complex emergency when affected populations are living in overcrowded evacuation centres and the water and sanitation infrastructure and practices are degraded [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Conversely, acute respiratory infections may occur in susceptible and malnourished populations living in overcrowded evacuation shelters with poor ventilation [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Furthermore, adverse mental health effects may occur as the result of physical and emotional trauma, displacement, life stressors after a disaster, and limited social support [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Social and economic consequences of disasters also indirectly impact health, well-being and development [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00538" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Examples of indirect health impacts include worsening of chronic health conditions due to the limited access to health care services, otherwise avoidable maternal deaths, and declining nutritional status due to food shortage [
