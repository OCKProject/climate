<p class="p">The natural streamflow datasets are not entirely free from human modification. For example, while land use change is minimal in these watersheds, other human modification such as agricultural practices (e.g., soil tilling, crop rotation) and management of natural lands (e.g., logging, fire management) that affect watershed hydrology may be present. Additionally, the human-modified watersheds may differ in type or degree of human modification (e.g., seasonal irrigation withdrawals vs. large in-stream dams). The question of the degree of modification is not easily resolved, as different modifications (land use change vs. dam/reservoir management) and their spatial location within the watershed can have differing effects on watershed hydrology and streamflow.</p>
