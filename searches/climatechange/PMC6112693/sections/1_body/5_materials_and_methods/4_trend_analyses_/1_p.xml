<p class="p">Statistical analyses and trends for all streamflow metrics and climate data were performed for the 1981–2015 water years, resulting in a 35-element time series for trend analyses. Trend magnitudes for water years 1981–2015 were assessed using the Theil–Sen slope estimator. The Theil–Sen slope is a robust estimator for trend analysis, as it uses the median slope of all data pairs. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Mann–Kendall trend test with a threshold 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value of 0.05. The streamflow metrics and climate data used in this work do not exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation, with lag-1 autocorrelation coefficients for all metrics being less than 0.25. All trends for streamflow metrics, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration were converted to percent change by dividing by the 35-y metric mean.
