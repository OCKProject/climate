<p class="p">To compare trends from natural and human-modified streamflow gauges, trends from human-modified streamflow gauges that were within 115 km of each natural streamflow gauge were extracted and the mean trend was estimated. This analysis allows for a direct comparison between natural and nearby human-modified streamflow trends. Differences in mean values between the natural and human-modified streamflow trends were estimated using a two-sample

 </ext-link>), which was used to determine which streamflow gauges shared similar characteristics. In these analyses, we incrementally expanded the radius around each natural streamflow gauge, including more and more human-modified gauges into the trend comparison analysis. The 115-km radius refers to the radius where the correlation between the natural and human-modified streamflow trends was the highest. The correlation lowered as the radius expanded (
