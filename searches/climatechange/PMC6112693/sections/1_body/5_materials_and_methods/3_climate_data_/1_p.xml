<p class="p">We extracted precipitation, ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>, maximum air temperature, and minimum air temperature from the 4-km gridded surface meteorological dataset [gridMET (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>)]. Canadian climate data were extracted from the monthly 4-km spatial resolution TerraClimate (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). For both datasets, ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> was estimated using the Penmanâ€“Monteith algorithm for a grass surface (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Climate data were examined at the voxel colocated with each gauge with the assumption that climate trends would be similar for the contributing watershed.
