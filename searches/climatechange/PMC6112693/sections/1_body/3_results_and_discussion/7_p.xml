<p class="p">Regardless of water resources management, proximate gauges show similar trends in most streamflow metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>; due to paucity of data, zero streamflow days were not analyzed in this manner). When comparing nearby locations, we find no statistically significant differences between trends of natural and human-modified streamflow median (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.15), 99th percentile (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.24), and 7-d maximum streamflow trends (
 <italic class="italic">P =</italic> 0.21). Further supporting this supposition, we find strong and statistically significant correlations between natural and human-modified streamflow trends at nearby locations for all variables (median: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.79, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; IQR: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.76, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 99th percentile: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.69, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 7-d maximum: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.66, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 1st percentile: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.50, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was, however, a statistically significant mean difference between natural and human-modified daily streamflow variability (IQR; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01) and 1st percentile streamflow trends (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) at nearby locations. These results suggest that, in managed systems, water management and reservoir releases to meet downstream water demands reduce some climate-driven streamflow variability and extremely low streamflow. For 1st percentile streamflow trends, for example, the trends were negative (mean trend of âˆ’3.5%) in natural watersheds compared with positive trends in human-modified watersheds (mean trend of 2.2%). Augmented low flows in managed systems are used to maintain ecosystem services, habitat for freshwater species, and water supply reliability for cities and agriculture. These results indicate that managed reservoirs may serve as a resource to mitigate the impacts of climate change on low baseflows and zero streamflow days for humans and aquatic ecosystems, particularly in areas where extreme low-flow events are increasing in frequency (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). However, total streamflow for all watersheds is inevitably limited by precipitation and evapotranspiration, so water management and water infrastructure have a limited ability to increase streamflow above that supplied by accumulated precipitation (
