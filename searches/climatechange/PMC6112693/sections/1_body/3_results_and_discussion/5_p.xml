<p class="p">For comparative purposes, we estimated trends for the same streamflow metrics assessed in Lins and Slack (

 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) analysis, however, contains fewer streamflow gauging stations and covers a different time period compared with our analysis. Specifically, there is limited temporal overlap between their study (ending in 1993) and our study (starting in 1981). Similar to Lins and Slack (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>), our results show fewer gauges with significant trends as streamflow percentiles increase. However, Lins and Slack (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) show a greater number of significant positive trends than significant negative trends, while our results indicate a more even balance between the two. These differences in streamflow trends correspond to widespread differences in reference evapotranspiration (ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>) and precipitation trends across the different time periods considered (

 <sub class="sub">o</sub>, along with regional changes in precipitation, that result from a combination of anthropogenic radiative forcing (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>) and decadal-scale internal climate variability (e.g., ref.
