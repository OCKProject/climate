<p class="p">We find positive trends in days without streamflow in the southwestern United States (∼10 more days per decade) and negative trends in the central United States (∼10 fewer days per decade). Even though this analysis is limited to streamflow gauges where days without streamflow exist throughout the observational record, changes in days without streamflow are extremely important both for total water supply reliability and the persistence of aquatic species, especially in the arid southwestern United States (

While days without streamflow may not represent a complete loss of water from a stream section, the remaining standing water represents an extreme habitat alteration (i.e., increased temperature, decreased dissolved oxygen). The longer the duration of this habitat alteration, the greater the potential for long-lasting negative impacts on freshwater taxa that are adapted to lotic systems (
