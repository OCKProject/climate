<p class="p">To examine the consistency of trends between natural and human-modified rivers and streams, we compare trends from gauges with natural streamflow to nearby gauges with human-modified streamflow. For each natural gauge, we extracted trends from all human-modified gauges within a 115-km radius and report the mean trend of these gauges (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">Materials and Methods</italic>
 </xref> for detailed information). This analysis assumes that streamflow from these proximate gauges is driven by similar climate variability and trends to that at the paired natural gauges. To avoid comparing streamflow trends from vastly different drainage areas, streamflow gauges in large watersheds (area, &gt;50,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were removed from this analysis.
