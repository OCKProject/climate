<p class="p">Spatial patterns of trends in precipitation closely match those of median streamflow trends, with decreases in precipitation throughout the southern and western United States (

 </ext-link>). We examine the combined effect of total water-year precipitation and ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> on streamflow trends using three multiple linear regression models (one with all gauges, one with only natural gauges, and one with only human-modified gauges). Regression models were estimated using median streamflow trend as the dependent variable and total water-year precipitation and ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> trend as the independent variables. While the regression using gauges in natural watersheds explains more variance than those using human-modified streamflows or all gauges, all three regressions produce similar regression coefficients that have substantial overlap in their 95% CIs (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). As a result, median daily streamflow trends show a similar combined sensitivity to precipitation and ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> trends in natural and human-modified systems and when they are pooled (
