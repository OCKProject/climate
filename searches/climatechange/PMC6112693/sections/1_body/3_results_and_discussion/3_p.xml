<p class="p">The trends in low streamflow have slightly higher rates of statistical significance (9.2% of the gauges have a significant positive trend for the 1st percentile trends, while 7.5% have a significant negative trend;

This larger spatial variability is likely due to the dominance of baseflow during low-flow conditions. Baseflow originates from groundwater and saturated soil, so it is primarily a function of local soils and geology rather than large-scale climate forcing (

Additionally, water management may obscure climate-driven trends in low streamflow as water is released from reservoirs to meet downstream water demands during dry periods (when baseflow would be low in natural watersheds), conveyance moves water within and between watersheds, and minimum instream flows limit water extraction when streamflow is low (
