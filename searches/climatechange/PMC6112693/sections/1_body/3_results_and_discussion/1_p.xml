<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">The trend analyses identify regionally distinct changes in recent streamflow throughout the United States and Canada that are largely consistent across all streamflow metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">3</xref>). We find negative streamflow trends from 1981 to 2015 for all streamflow metrics throughout the southern/southeastern United States and the western United States and Canada, except for the Pacific Northwest. The largest negative trends in streamflow (∼30–50% for all metrics) occur in the southwestern United States and southern Great Plains, which corroborate previous work on streamflow using only natural gauges (

 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), California (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), and central United States (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>) during the latter part of our period of record have reinforced trends in those regions. Additionally, we find a band of positive streamflow trends (∼10–50%) from central/south-central Canada throughout the Great Lakes region that extends into New England and southeastern Canada. This band has a break in the north-central United States for median streamflow trends, where an area of negative or minimal streamflow change exists (
