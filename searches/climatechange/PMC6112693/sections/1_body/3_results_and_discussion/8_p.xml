<p class="p">To infer the causes of natural and human-modified streamflow trends, we assess precipitation and ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> trends for the same time period using the gridMET 4-km dataset (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>) for the United States and the TerraClimate 4-km dataset (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>) for Canada. Climate trends are estimated using the grid point closest to the streamflow gauge as a proxy for the climate variability of the contributing watershed. While this may not capture all climate trends upstream of the gauge, many of the watersheds used in this analysis have a small drainage area (

 <sub class="sub">o</sub> for the period of record and relate these variables to median streamflow trends. Given that streamflow trends are similar across metrics and the temporal mismatch between precipitation and streamflow extremes (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>), we focus on median streamflow.
