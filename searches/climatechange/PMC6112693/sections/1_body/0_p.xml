 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). As streamflow is generated by precipitation and snowmelt that is not lost to evapotranspiration or groundwater recharge, much of the interannual variability in streamflow can be traced to concurrent variability in climate (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). As concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase, spatial and seasonal precipitation patterns are altered (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>), the proportion of precipitation falling as snow is reduced (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>), and evaporative demand is increased (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). In natural watersheds, these changes can directly affect the timing and volume of streamflow. Due to human modifications of the landscape, however, many streamflow regimes throughout the world, including over one-half of the worldâ€™s large river systems, can no longer be considered natural (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Primary human modifications include reservoir construction and irrigation projects, which, in some cases, can mask, dampen, or even change the sign of natural streamflow trends (
