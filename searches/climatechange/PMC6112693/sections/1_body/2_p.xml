<p class="p">We address this knowledge gap by analyzing daily streamflow trends in natural and human-modified systems based on data from 3,119 stream gauges throughout Canada and the United States using 1981â€“2015 water-year data (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>) and the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN) of Environment Canada (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>), which are screened to include only sites for which streamflow reflects prevailing meteorological conditions with minimal land use change. We concentrate on statistics that assess changes in daily streamflow across a number of ecologically and water resource-relevant characteristics including median daily streamflow, daily streamflow variability [interquartile range (IQR); a measure of seasonal variability], and daily extremes (1st and 99th percentiles, 7-d maximum, and number of days without streamflow per year). We first discuss overall trends in streamflow, then investigate differences in trends between natural and human-modified watersheds, and finally evaluate the relative role of climatic drivers on the streamflow trends. This study does not assess differences in the shape of the hydrograph between human-modified and natural watersheds. While it is very likely that human modification has altered the natural streamflow regime, this study focuses on temporal changes (trends) in summary statistics of streamflow.
