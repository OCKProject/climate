<p class="p">Past research using a variety of metrics has demonstrated that streamflow trends in natural watersheds closely follow regional changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration (

While these studies highlight the influence of climate changes on streamflow trends, they do not investigate trends in human-modified watersheds, which are more common throughout the world. For example, the continental United States contains âˆ¼75,000 dams that have varying degrees of influence on streamflow regimes (
