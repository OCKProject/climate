 <p class="p">Climate change is expected to alter streamflow volume and variability in watersheds throughout the world, which will have impacts on agricultural, aquatic, and urban environments. Human modifications such as the building of reservoirs and the extraction of water for agricultural and urban uses, however, are thought to mask climate-induced changes in streamflow. Using observed streamflow data from over 3,000 sites from 1981 to 2015, this work identifies negative trends in streamflow throughout the southern and western portions of the United States and positive trends across the eastern portion of the United States and Canada. Within these regions, streamflow trends from human-modified sites are similar to unimpacted sites, indicating that the signal of climate change is apparent in all streamflow systems.</p>
