 <xref rid="pone.0132066.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> are the best three runs for each model structure as to individual training accuracies for different number of hidden nodes. With all the runs and model structures examined, the best ANNs for modelling BA and volume increments consisted of eight hidden nodes. Optimised ANNs for both variables consisted of 13 input nodes, eight hidden-layer nodes, and one output node.
