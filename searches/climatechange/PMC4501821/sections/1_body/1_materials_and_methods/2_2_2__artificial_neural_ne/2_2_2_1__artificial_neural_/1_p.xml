<p class="p">At the tree level, individual trees were described in the model by their species and size (i.e., BA). Forty-three tree species present in the PSPs were grouped into eighteen separate species categories for simplification (

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]). Dominant tree height was used to reflect stand developmental stage. Total stand BA of softwoods and hardwoods (BASW, BAHW) were used to reflect the overall stand composition. Inter-tree competition was captured by ranking trees according to their size. PSP total BA of all larger softwood and hardwood trees than a given tree (BALSW, BALHW) were used as inputs to account for competition among individual trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], was selected as a model input to help capture stand-growing conditions. Site conditions and growing environment were defined by biophysical variables, such as (i) incident solar radiation (SR), (ii) cumulative growing degree-days (GDD), and (iii) indices of soil nutrient and water content. Present-day and future forest response to changing climate was defined for four main forest growth scenarios: historical tree-growth records (PSP data) were considered to represent present-day climate, whereas JABOWA-3 generated data for three climate-change scenarios were used to represent future growing conditions. The inputs, their units, abbreviated codes, and species groups are listed in Tables
