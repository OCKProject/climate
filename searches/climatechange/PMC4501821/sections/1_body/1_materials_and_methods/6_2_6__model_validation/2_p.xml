<p class="p">Observed and ANN-predicted BA and volume increments were plotted against the 1:1 line. We also plotted residuals to get further insight as to the prediction accuracy of ANNs. The validation dataset along with relevant ANN predictions were categorised according to climate scenario, since the model was developed with a special intention to predict forest response under conditions of climate change. The residuals ([observed increment]-[ANN-predicted increment]) vs. individual-tree size (BA) were plotted according to climate scenario.</p>
