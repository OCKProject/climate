<p class="p">Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient was calculated for normalised data, while BIAS was calculated from de-normalised data. The final ANNs for BA and volume increments were selected based on training accuracy indicated by R, MSE, and BIAS. The ANNs selected with optimised and set weights were validated against independent datasets.</p>
