<p class="p">The dataset assembled for training and validating the individual ANNs for BA and volume increment predictions consisted of 326,395 records of tree growth for each network; 220,657 records extracted from historical datasets (i.e., PSPs) as representative of present-day forest conditions, and 105,738 tree-growth records generated with JABOWA-3 for the three climate scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2). The dataset was then divided into a training sub-dataset (75% of the original dataset) and validation sub-dataset (25%). Both training and validation sub-datasets were normalised to a range from -1 to 1, due to widely varying ranges and magnitudes of inputs and outputs [
