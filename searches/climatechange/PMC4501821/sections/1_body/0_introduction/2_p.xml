 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Climate change will modify tree-growing environments by altering site conditions, such as soil water content, atmospheric humidity, soil and air temperatures, and the length of growing seasons. The forest industry is expected to be the most affected by climate change, compared to other resource-based industries. This is because normal harvesting rotations for timber range from 50 to 100 years for most tree species and present-day forests are expected to experience a period of transition from current to future growing conditions over the next 100 years. Forests provide important socio-economic and ecological services, and existing forests cannot be replaced quickly over the short term to accommodate the anticipated changes in tree-growing environment. Therefore, existing forests need to be managed during this period of transition with well-informed management plans that account for the effects of climate change.
