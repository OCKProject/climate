<p class="p">There is an urgent need for practical and simple G&amp;Y models, easily operated by forest managers, and yet sophisticated enough to predict future forest dynamics under a changing climate. The preferred models should be based on empirical data, but should not be as complicated as process-based models. The objective of this study was to develop a simple G&amp;Y model that (1) utilises conventional tree- and stand-growth attributes, and (2) has the capability to predict individual-tree growth under different climate-change scenarios. The new model was developed by combining tree growth information generated with a process-based model and historical data acquired from permanent sample plots (PSPs).</p>
