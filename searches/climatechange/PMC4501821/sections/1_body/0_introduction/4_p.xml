<p class="p">Process-based models are widely used to investigate forest response to climatic change because they predict tree growth based on biological cause-and-effect associations [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Considerable attempts had been made to use gap models to evaluate climate change impacts on forests [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, gap models have rarely been used in conventional forest management planning due to their intensive data requirements, model structure complexity, and incompatibility with management needs to produce G&amp;Y information [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Process-based models do not have the same accuracy at regional scales compared to conventional models (empirical), because they are not developed to account for site differences across regions.
