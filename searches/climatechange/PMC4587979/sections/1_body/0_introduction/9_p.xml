<p class="p">Comparatively, twitter data is more indicative of how people refer to topics of interest [
 <xref rid="pone.0138996.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0138996.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], in a manner that is very linguistically restricted. As well, twitter is used as a platform for verbal expression of emotional responses. Due to the restrictions on tweet size (each tweet can only be 140 characters in length), it is necessary to be more direct in dealing with topics of interest to the tweeter. Therefore, the tweets are linguistically more emotionally charged and can be used to define a level of emotional response by the tweeter.
