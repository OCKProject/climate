<p class="p">Macroalgae, mostly phaeophyta, are the dominant marine vegetation along the arctic and sub-arctic coasts, where they form lush and productive populations (Pedersen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2011</xref>; Krause-Jensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>) and provide important ecological goods and services such as primary production, nutrient retention, habitat complexity, marine biodiversity, fertiliser and food production (Steneck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2002</xref>; Schmidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2011</xref>). Macroalgal growth, survival and reproduction in northern regions are largely controlled by climatic conditions such as light, temperature and, for intertidal species, also icebergs and sea ice scour (e.g., Zacher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wiencke and Amsler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2012</xref>). Climate conditions along the sub-arctic and arctic coasts reach extreme values and exhibit wide seasonal fluctuations partly due to the arctic dark season in combination with the development of sea ice that result into days to months of 24 h darkness above the Arctic Circle (66°N). Ice scour from icebergs and pack ice particularly impacts intertidal rocky shores, and, thus, lush intertidal seaweed populations mostly develop in sheltered areas. Latitudinal variations in climatic conditions along the sub-arctic and arctic regions determine the position of biogeographical distribution edges of species (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>) and may constrain macroalgal growth and productivity as observed in kelp forests (Krause-Jensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>). Recent studies document poleward migration of geographical distribution ranges of marine biota, including macroalgae, in response to ocean warming (Poloczanska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2013</xref>; Yesson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref>; Straub et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2016</xref>). There is limited in situ documentation of responses of macroalgae along sub-arctic and arctic coasts. Instead, laboratory studies of temperature tolerance and response are used as a basis for predictions of future distribution limits and response to climate change (e.g., Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wilson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2015</xref>; Wilce 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>).
