<p class="p">Here we assess whether arctic climate (i.e., temperature, sea ice cover) change affects growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> populations at the northern fringe of the sub-arctic. We do so by retrospectively quantifying seaweed growth in six Greenlandic and two Norwegian populations between 64.2°N and 69.2°N since 1997–2002 and examine its relation with climatic forcing. Moreover, we examine large-scale patterns in 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth in relation to variability in summer seawater temperature across the entire biogeographical distribution range of the species. We discuss how projected arctic warming, under the IPCC scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>), may affect the productivity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> at the northern distribution limit of the species during the twenty-first century.
