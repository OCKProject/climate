<p class="p">The arctic climate is rapidly changing due to excessive anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>). The Arctic Ocean ranks amongst the oceans warming at the fastest rate, twice as fast as the global ocean, and it experiences the largest thermal marine seasonal shifts recorded globally since 1960 (Burrows et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2011</xref>). Arctic warming is also evidenced by the rapid loss of sea ice cover during the last decades, which reached the minimum extension ever recorded in 2012 (Vaughan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2013</xref>). Arctic warming is expected to continue and, even under a mild scenario of greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., IPCC scenario RCP4.5), global models project a median of 4.9 °C (maximum 9.3 °C) warming by the end of the twenty-first Century (Christensen et al.
