<p class="p">Our 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> results are in accord with trends reported for other sub-arctic littoral macroalgal communities in response to arctic warming (Weslawski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2010</xref>; Fredriksen and Kile 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>; Fredriksen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>). Our results also agree with reported trends for sub-arctic subtidal macroalgal communities of increased cover and diversity in Svalbard fjords from 1980 to 2003 (Beuchel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2006</xref>) and from 1980 to 2010 (Kortsch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2012</xref>), increased macroalgal biomass in other Svalbard fjords over the period 1996–2013 (Bartsch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>) and increased growth of kelp in response to reduced sea ice cover in North East Greenland over the period 1999–2011 (Krause-Jensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>). Some of these studies point at intertidal macroalgal communities being more responsive to climate changes than sublittoral communities. Indeed, Helmuth et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2006</xref>) suggested that intertidal communities are particularly sensitive to changing temperatures.
