<p class="p">Our results show that substantial variability in 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth at northern populations correlates with temperature (45%) and ice-free days (53%) variability. However, these results also indicate that other environmental factors cause variability in growth. For instance, salinity, which constrains the distribution of macroalgae (Nielsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1995</xref>), varies from 28 to 33‰ in Kobbefjord Mid during the growing season (spring–summer; Sørensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>) and may explain the relatively slow growth rates at this site. The growth season of populations located at Lofoten and Tromsø (Norway) is shorter than that at Kobbefjord because of their higher latitudinal location, and this could limit their annual growth rate, despite being exposed to higher temperatures. The degree of wave exposure could also constrain intertidal macroalgal growth since it has been demonstrated that wave exposure increases the stress of rocky shore intertidal communities (Scrosati and Heaven
