<p class="p">Recent studies also suggest some poleward migration of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> in response to warming based on knowledge on temperature tolerance in combination with predicted future isotherm migration (Jueterbock et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>; Neiva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, these studies do not consider the northernmost Greenland populations neither in the current distribution maps nor in future scenarios. Also the scenarios for 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum</italic> distribution in year 2100 and 2200 suggest retreat of some populations even along the northern distribution limit (Jueterbock et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>; Neiva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our results suggest that warming of coastal water would lead to an overall stimulation and expansion of the northernmost populations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic>. Future distribution boundaries and the speed of northward migration will, however, also depend heavily on the dispersal capacity of the species.
