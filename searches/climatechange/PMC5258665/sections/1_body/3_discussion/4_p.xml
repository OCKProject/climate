<p class="p">These results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> communities are excellent bioindicators of climate change in the marine arctic, and that the estimation of tip growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> may be used as a relevant parameter in sub-arctic and arctic marine monitoring programmes. In fact, the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring Programme
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> has already adopted 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> tip growth as an important marine bioindicator of environmental change in the Nuuk area, West Greenland.
