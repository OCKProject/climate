<p class="p">This study reports the longest time series on seaweed growth in the sub-arctic region so far published, spanning from one to six decades at the northern edge of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</italic>’s distribution range. The longest time series documented significant increases in 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth rates over time with the fastest increases occurring since 1990. The temporal trends of faster growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> were in agreement with general trends of warming and longer ice-free periods (at sites with seasonal ice cover). All the northern populations above 68°N (i.e., Qeqertarsuaq, Kronprinsens Ejland, Lofoten; except Tromsø for which we have only had a short time series) showed a significantly positive temporal increase in annual growth with air warming (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). We also saw a latitudinal trend of increased growth of sub-arctic 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> populations from north to south along Greenland’s coast matching the higher temperatures and the reduced sea ice cover towards the south. In addition, our data clearly show that 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> populations grow much faster at 69°N along Norway’s Gulf Current-influenced coast, than at the same latitude in the colder and partly ice-covered Greenland waters.
