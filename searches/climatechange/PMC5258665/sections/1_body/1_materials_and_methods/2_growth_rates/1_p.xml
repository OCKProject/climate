<p class="p">Between 6 and 20 of the oldest thalli of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic>, overall representing 3–17 years of growth, were harvested from all study sites except Kapisillit. On each of the collected specimens we measured the length between consecutive bladders from the tip to the base of the thallus (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>: tip to base of 1st bladder, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>: base of 1st bladder to base of 2nd bladder,

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>: base of 2nd bladder to base of 3rd bladder, etc. continuing to the holdfast; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). These measurements retrospectively provided estimates of annual growth (assessed as tip elongation rate) of each year along the thallus lifespan. At Kapisillit, we measured the length of the youngest 3 internodes of 20–25 thalli of randomly collected individuals in the mid-intertidal.
