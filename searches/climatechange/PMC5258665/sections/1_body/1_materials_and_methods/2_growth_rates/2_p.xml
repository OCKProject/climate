<p class="p">Annual growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> was retrospectively estimated as the length of a fully grown internode, assuming that it represents 1 year of growth (MacFarlane 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1933</xref>). This technique was applied to assess the growth during the year previous to collection based on the length of the youngest complete internode (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), the growth 2 years before collection based on the length of the second youngest complete internode (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b) and so forth for the full length of the thallus. Because the youngest section of the tip (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) did not fully grow at the time of sampling, we only included growth estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and older segments in the analysis.
