<p class="p">We estimated the average time series of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth for each location by calculating the mean (and standard error) of our growth measurements for each year. For some populations, we could extend the time series back in time using estimates from earlier studies at the same sites. The starting and ending year of the time series of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> annual growth at each location is provided in TableÂ
