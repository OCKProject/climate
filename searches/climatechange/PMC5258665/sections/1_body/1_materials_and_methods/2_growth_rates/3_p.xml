<p class="p">The assumption that 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> tips produce one bladder per year was tested by marking tips at Qeqertarsuaq and Kobbefjord Mid populations. A thin cable tie was placed between the youngest and the second youngest bladder of selected thalli. One year later, the cable tie was displaced to the position between the second and third youngest bladder (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), hence confirming the notion that 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> tips produce one bladder per year. The technique was further validated based on reconstructed growth estimates at Kobbefjord populations in August/September during two consecutive years (2009 and 2010). The length of the segment 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> sampled in 2009 hence matched the length of the segment 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> measured on thalli collected in 2010.
