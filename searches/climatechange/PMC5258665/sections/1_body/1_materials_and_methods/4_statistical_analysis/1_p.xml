<p class="p">We used linear regression analysis to assess linear temporal trends in climatic variables (ice-free days, air temperature) and in 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth. The regression analyses were performed on smoothed time series by a running average of 3Â years. Trends in climatic variables were computed for the entire time series and for the period between 1990 and 2012, to encompass the period of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth records. Regression analysis was also used to examine the relationships between 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth and climatic variables. Because the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth and ice-free days across all sites was exponential, we performed the regression analysis on ln-transformed growth estimates. The relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth and latitude across the distribution range of the species was assessed with a quadratic function.
