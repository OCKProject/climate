<p class="p">Air temperature for the Greenland sites was obtained from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) (Carpenter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2013</xref>). We used DMI stations in Nuuk, Sisimiut and Aasiaat and Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET) in Lofoten and Tromsø for coupling air temperature with 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> data (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). DMI stations provided air temperature time series recorded every 3 h. Annual mean air temperature was calculated by averaging all measurements within each year. MET provided time series of monthly average air temperature values for the Tromsø station. Monthly means of air temperatures at Tromsø were averaged from January to December to calculate the annual mean air temperature for this station. We excluded from the time series the years without records from January to December. We used the annual mean air temperature at Lofoten station provided by MET.
