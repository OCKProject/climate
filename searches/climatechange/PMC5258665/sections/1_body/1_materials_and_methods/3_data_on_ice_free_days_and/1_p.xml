<p class="p">The length of the annual sea ice-free period was estimated from satellite images as described by Krause-Jensen et al. (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The satellite images did not allow analysis for Kapisillit, where most pixels contained overlapping land and sea information. The Norwegian sampling sites were not ice-covered. The information was obtained on the basis of sea ice concentration data obtained from passive microwave imagery processed with the Enhanced NASA Team algorithm (Markus and Cavalieri
