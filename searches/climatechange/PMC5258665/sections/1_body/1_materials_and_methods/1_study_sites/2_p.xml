<p class="p">The dataset was further supplemented by historical observations of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth from the northernmost Greenland sites collected by R.T. Wilce at Kronprinsens Ejland in June 1959 and June 1986 and by Louise Hansen at Qeqertarsuaq in June 1999 (Hansen

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 19) and 1986 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20), growth was measured on herbarium specimens and corrected for the ca. 10% shrinking due to drying (Hansen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2004</xref>). Annual growth estimates provided by Hansen (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2004</xref>). Specimens collected by R.T. Wilce and L. Hansen provided growth estimates for the 2 years prior collection (i.e., years 1957, 1958, 1984, 1985 and 1997, 1998).
