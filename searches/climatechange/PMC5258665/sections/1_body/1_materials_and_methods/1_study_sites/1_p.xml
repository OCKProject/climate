<p class="p">Eight sites were studied along the coasts of West Greenland and North Norway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). Greenland’s west coast study sites extend from Kobbefjord (two sites) and Kapisillit in the Godthåbsfjord system, Nuuk, at 64°N, Sisimiut at 67°N to Qeqertarsuaq and Kronprinsens Ejland on/by the Disko Island at 69°N, which represent the northernmost observations of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> in Greenland. We included two additional study sites in northern Norway, Hell on the Lofoten Islands (68°N) and Tromsø (69°N), i.e., at similar latitude as the northernmost Greenland sites, but subjected to the warmer waters of the Gulf Current. Our 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> collections were made between the years 2009 and 2012 at the mid-intertidal zone in August/September except those at Tromsø which we sampled in January (Table
