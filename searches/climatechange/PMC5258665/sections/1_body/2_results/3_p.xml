<p class="p">All 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> populations exhibited inter-annual variability of growth during the studied period. 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth tended to increase towards recent time in most of the studied populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The growth rate of the tips of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> thalli in the arctic and sub-arctic populations for the last 1–6 decades ranged between 2.0 cm per tip and year (Kronprinsens Ejland) and 9.1 cm per tip and year (Kobbefjord Mid, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The fastest growth was observed after 2005 in all populations except for those at Sisimiut and Qeqertarsuaq where 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> grew at similar rates during the period for which records are available (1997–2009, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth exhibited significant temporal increasing trends in some populations. At the Kronprinsens Ejland population, that with the longest growth time series recorded, 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth increased by, on average, 0.03 ± 0.01 cm every year since 1958 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The growth rate of this population accelerated after 1990 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). A significant temporal trend of increased growth after 1990 was also observed at Lofoten and Kobbefjord Mid populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with the Lofoten population showing the fastest increase in annual growth (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth tended to decrease towards the north but without a significant relationship with latitude (Table
