<p class="p">Annual mean air temperature at the studied sites since the onset of available records (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) ranged between −8.9 and 4.8 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Annual mean air temperature at each location exhibited substantial fluctuations, with the temporal pattern differing between the Norwegian and the Greenland coasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Annual mean air temperature at Lofoten, since 1900, and at Aasiaat and Sisimiut, since 1950, has significantly increased (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Warming rates ranged from 0.01 ± 0.002 °C per year (Lofoten) to 0.04 ± 0.01 °C per year (Sisimiut). Annual mean temperature after 1990 at all observatories, on average, has been between 0.23 °C (Nuuk) and 1.08 °C (Sisimiut) higher than before 1990 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Since 1990, the period when most of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> growth estimates are available, annual mean air temperature showed a significant monotonous increase through time in the Greenland arctic and sub-arctic sites (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). At the Greenlandic sites, air warming showed a steeper increase over the last 3 decades. Significant warming rates of 0.13 ± 0.02 °C per year, at Nuuk, and more than 0.2 °C per year at Aasiaat and Sisimiut were recorded (Table
