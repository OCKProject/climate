<p class="p">Tromsø and Lofoten sites were free of sea ice for the entire year because the Gulf Current brings heat along the Norwegian coast. In contrast, all Greenland sites have been covered with sea ice some days of the year since 1990 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The shortest annual sea ice-free period was recorded at Qeqertarsuaq and Kronprinsens Ejland (52 days). The longest annual sea ice-free period was observed at Kobbefjord sites, even though the fjord was devoid of sea ice during the period 2003–2006. Annual sea ice-free days increased at all Greenland sites since 1990 at rates varying from 2.56 ± 0.71 days per year (Kobbefjord, Nuuk) to 9.12 days per year (Qeqertarsuaq and Kronprinsens Ejland, Table
