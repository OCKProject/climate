 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> populations located at the northern edge of the species occurrence grew 2.4 times slower than populations located further south, i.e., along the Atlantic coasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Indeed, annual growth rate of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> tended to increase from populations at 40
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>N to those growing at 55
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>N, where maximum growth rates were reported (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Above 60
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>N, 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> growth rate rapidly decreased the further north the populations were located (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
