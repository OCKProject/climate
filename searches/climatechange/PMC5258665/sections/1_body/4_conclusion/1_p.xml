<p class="p">Our results demonstrate a marked positive response of growth rates of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> populations to warming at the northern fringe of the sub-arctic. 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> as well as the majority of other key species of marine vegetation in Greenland are cold-temperate species with optimum temperatures considerably above current temperature regimes of cold boreal coastal waters (Fortes and Lüning 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">1980</xref>; Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wiencke and Amsler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2012</xref>). The stimulating effect of warming on 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> productivity at the northern edge of occurrence may continue well into the future, suggesting more productive intertidal communities in the future sub-arctic. Given the role of 
 <italic class="italic">A. nodosum</italic> as key foundation species, climate change is expected to increase food and habitat provision to intertidal communities.
