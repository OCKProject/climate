<p id="Par39" class="p">More detailed examination of the effects of climate, policy and impact uncertainties on modelling outcomes is needed (Chandramowli and Felder 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>). The use of a climate model ensemble mean can reduce the uncertainty due to differences between climate models; however, it does not address the uncertainty analytically or allow the modeller to quantify it. It may also hide the effect of extreme but uncommon events. Further sensitivity assessments using the full range of GCMs (such as Carvajal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2017</xref>) and intermodel comparisons, in the style of the ISI-MIP project (Warszawski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2014</xref>), are needed in order to address these uncertainties more explicitly.
