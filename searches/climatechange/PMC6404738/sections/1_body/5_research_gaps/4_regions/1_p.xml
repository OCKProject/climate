 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref> and consistent with the summary in IPCC WGII (Field et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>), regional studies are still scarce for developing countries, indicating that data availability and research funding are likely significant factors in the choice of study area. In general, comments on the extent to which studies are applicable to the wider industry and geography are limited but would be useful to aid the prioritisation of further research. Furthermore, few climate change impact studies are performed at the global scale, as regional studies have the advantage of being able to use higher resolution data. Further global studies and regional studies for developing countries are needed to facilitate the inclusion of the impacts in global IAMs.
