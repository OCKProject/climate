<p id="Par29" class="p">In most of these studies, impacts were simulated exogenously from the energy system model. More thorough representation has previously been limited by challenges in finding suitable climate data, translating climate data into a form that is relevant for the energy system, and lack of detail in energy system models (Dowling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>). Incorporating physical impacts endogenously could enable the researchers to more easily examine the full feedback mechanisms. For example, by iteratively exchanging data between an energy system model and climate emulator, Labriet et al. (
