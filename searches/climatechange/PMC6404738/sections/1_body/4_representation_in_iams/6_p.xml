<p id="Par31" class="p">As for impact studies, several IAMÂ authors (e.g. de Lucena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2010</xref>) note their results are highly dependent on the climate model used as the driver. To reduce the impact of the selection of a single climate projection, some studies use an ensemble mean (e.g. Seljom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>; Parkinson and Djilali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, little discussion is included evaluating the strengths or weaknesses of these approaches. Mima and Criqui (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) examined this uncertainty by running the POLES model with 10 climate model projections for a single emissions scenario, noting the high variation prohibits decision-making in some cases.
