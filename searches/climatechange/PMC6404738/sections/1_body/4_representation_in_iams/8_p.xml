<p id="Par33" class="p">To address the extensive uncertainties involved in climate change impact modelling, and the difficulties involved in quantifying them, multi-model comparisons can be used. For example, McFarland et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref>) incorporated demand-side climate change impacts in three US power sector models aiming to increase the robustness of the results. This study identified that the main source of difference between the models was the underlying data used for calibration, though the authors did not narrow the range of results based on this conclusion. Going forward, multi-model comparisons would be useful to explore the differences between parametric and model structure uncertainty.
