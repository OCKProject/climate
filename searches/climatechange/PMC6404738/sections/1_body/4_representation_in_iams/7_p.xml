<p id="Par32" class="p">Using full climate models in conjunction with energy system models is computationally expensive (Labriet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2015b</xref>), so some use a climate simulator model. Endogenous representation of climate change impacts in IAMs could be limited by this representation of climate change. In a comparison of how well seven well-developed IAMs simulate climate change, van Vuuren et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2011</xref>) note large variations in the steps by which IAMs link GHG emissions to temperature change: the equilibrium and transient climate change calculations, radiative forcing response to changes in CO

However, the comparison found that the climate change results of most IAMs are within the range of the outcomes of the more complex models, indicating that climate change simulation should not prevent further work on incorporating impacts into IAMs.
