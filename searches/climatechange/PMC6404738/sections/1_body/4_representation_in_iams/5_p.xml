<p id="Par30" class="p">Representing climate impacts in wider energy system models requires careful consideration of temporal and spatial resolution and extent. For example, for energy system optimisation modelling, a time horizon of a few decades may be chosen to limit the impact of growing technology and cost uncertainties. However, a longer time horizon may be desirable to examine the larger impacts of climate change or the importance of technology lock-in (Parkinson and Djilali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2015</xref>). Some impact models require high-resolution input data, such as local topographic features in process-based hydrological models. Due to computational expense, these are often run at regional scales, making it more difficult to combine them with global-scale energy system models (Parkinson and Djilali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2015</xref>). Global models may use simpler simulations and cover a much larger extent but include less detail on land characteristics and processes (e.g. Labriet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015a</xref>). Finally, global IAMs generally represent the world as approximately 10â€“30 regions only, so climate impact data must be aggregated to this scale. The variations in impacts within these regions can present problems for this aggregation.
