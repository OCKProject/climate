<p id="Par27" class="p">Including physical technology-level impacts has been identified as a research gap by the IPCC Working Group III (Clarke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is required for cost-effectiveness analysis of climate stabilisation paths because, as described above, climate change can affect the availability of low-carbon supply options, necessitate reinforcement of the supply system and impact GHG emissions (Fisher-Vanden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2013</xref>). Modelling physical impacts can also allow examination of their relative importance compared to socio-economic drivers (e.g. Isaac and van Vuuren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2009</xref>) and exploration of adaptation options to reduce impacts on the whole system rather than an individual element. For example, by allowing and restricting various combinations of other generation technologies (e.g. natural gas), Parkinson and Djilali (
