<p id="Par14" class="p">Reviewing wind impacts literature, Pryor and Barthelmie (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2010</xref>) found average wind speeds around Europe and North America would remain within ± 15% of current values by the end of the century. This limit has since been revised up to ± 20% (Tobin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2015</xref>; Davy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2017</xref>) and ± 30% (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2017</xref>). Limited studies suggest there will be no significant change in wind resource over China (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>) or Southern Africa (Fant et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>).
