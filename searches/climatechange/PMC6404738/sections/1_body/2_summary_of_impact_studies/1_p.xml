 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> summarises the impacts described in the reviewed studies. Elements of the energy system are affected by changes to average climatic conditions, the variability of conditions and the frequency and intensity ofÂ extreme weather events. Impacts studies on wind and hydropower resources dominate the literature, followed by bioenergy resources and the performance of thermo-electric power plants (TPPs). Impacts of gradual changes to climatic parameters such as temperature and precipitation have been studied more than changes to extreme weather events, as existing tools have limited ability to capture extreme events.
