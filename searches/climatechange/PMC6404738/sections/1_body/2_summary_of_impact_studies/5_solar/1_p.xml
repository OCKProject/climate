<p id="Par15" class="p">Climate change projections tend to agree that cloud cover will decrease in low- to mid-latitude regions (Patt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2013</xref>); however, increases in solar resource will often be counterbalanced by decreasing efficiency due to rising temperatures. As such, regional studies tend to project changes in solar generation of less than ± 10% by the end of the century (Crook et al.
