<p id="Par21" class="p">Potential for adaptation to climate change is covered inconsistently. For example, several authors comment that negative impacts on wind and solar generation and infrastructure will be insignificant because rapid development and relatively short lifetimes of these technologies allow adaptation through technological upgrades and siting (e.g. Ebinger and Vergara 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2011</xref>). Careful siting of new thermal power stations may also be possible to mitigate risk of water shortages. However, most power plants are currently situated where decreasing mean annual streamflow and strongly increasing water temperatures are projected (van Vliet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2016</xref>) and water competition may be exacerbated in the future by increased deployment of carbon capture and storage and biomass crops (e.g. Chandel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>; Byers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2016</xref>). For siting to be considered a feasible adaptation solution at the local level for any technology, high-resolution national impact studies and communication with industry partners are required. For hydropower, design changes and dam management may also provide adaptation options (Vicuña et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2011</xref>). van Vliet et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2016</xref>) note that an increase in plant efficiency of approximately 10% would offset the mean annual negative impacts for most regions (greater improvements would be required to offset monthly impacts) but no financial cost is given for this type and level of adaptation. No quantitative studies were found to examine other adaptation options, such as changing water dispatch patterns or regulations on cooling water discharge temperatures, or strengthening generation or transmission infrastructure.
