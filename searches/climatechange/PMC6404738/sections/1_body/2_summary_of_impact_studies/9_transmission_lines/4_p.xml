<p id="Par22" class="p">As impact studies generally examine one or two elements of the energy system in isolation and there are gaps in the regional coverage of the literature, it is unclear whether the degree to which different impacts have been studied is representative of the impacts’ perceived importance, or rather the current state of modelling ability. Relative importance can be assessed most simply by considering the percentage share of generation technologies in different regions, as done for hydropower by Turner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2017</xref>). As supply technologies play different roles in the system (e.g. base or peak load generation) and may interact through water use, understanding of the relative importance of impacts and their combined effects may be improved by the use of combined modelling approaches (e.g. Rübbelke and Vögele

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2016</xref>) and by the integration of several climate change impacts in models of the wider electricity and energy systems.
