<p id="Par17" class="p">Both average yields and the areas suitable for growing bioenergy crops are affected by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Broadly, yields are expected to increase at high latitudes and decrease at low latitudes, for example by as much as − 16% and + 28% in the 2050s (Haberl et al.
