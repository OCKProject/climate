<p id="Par8" class="p">This paper provides an updated, extended review of the literature on supply-side climate change impacts. Methods to incorporate impacts on heating and cooling demand in IAMs, mainly with heating and cooling degree days, have already been demonstrated by several IAMs (see OR2). So we focus here on supply-side impacts: on primary resources, generation technologies and energy transport. To examine the robustness of trends indicated in the impacts literature, we examine the levels of agreement between studies and the extent to which the system elements and regions of the world are covered (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). As climate change hazards, physical and operational resilience and adaptation capability vary significantly around the world, findings from impacts literature cannot be automatically applied across regions. We discuss the principal sources of disagreement between studies (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref>) and the ways in which climate impacts have been incorporated into IAMs (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref>), so that we can finally prioritise the remaining research gaps (Sections 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec" class="xref">7</xref>).
