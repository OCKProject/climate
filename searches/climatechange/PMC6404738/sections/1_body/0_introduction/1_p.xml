<p id="Par3" class="p">Major decarbonisation of the energy system has a large part to play in climate change mitigation (Bruckner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, components of the energy system are also affected by climate change itself, via long-term changes in climate parameters, variability and extreme weather events (Field et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>). In this fast-moving field of research, it is vital that we take stock of the literature quantifying the impacts, assess how that understanding is being used in energy system models and identify key research priorities.
