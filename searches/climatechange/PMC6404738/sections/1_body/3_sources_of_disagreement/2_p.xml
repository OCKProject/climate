<p id="Par24" class="p">Many studies depend heavily on the modellersâ€™ choice of GCM(s), especially those for which precipitation is a main driver. For example, various studies note that projections for hydropower and bioenergy resources remain highly uncertain in some regions due to disagreement between GCMs (Hamududu and Killingtveit

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015a</xref>). As shown in the IPCC AR5 WGI (Stocker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2013</xref>), the variation in GCM precipitation results is high over large parts of North and South America, Africa, southern Europe, southern Asia and Australia, especially under the lower emissions scenario. Modelling uncertainty is also important for wind and solar studies. Examining an ensemble of 10 GCMs, Karnauskas et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2017</xref>) conclude that results for some regions (tropics and southern sub-tropics) are only robust for the later part of the century under the higher emissions scenario. Fant et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>) note the high uncertainty in cloud cover projections may account for the low number of solar impact studies. As well as preventing robust impact predictions, climate modelling uncertainty can preclude meaningful evaluation of adaptation options (Donatelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>). Where there is a high variation between GCMs, impact models can be driven with projections representing the full range of GCM results to represent the uncertainty, as was done for hydropower in Ecuador by Carvajal et al. (
