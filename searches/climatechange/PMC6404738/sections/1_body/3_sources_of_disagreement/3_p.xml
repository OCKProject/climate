 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2014</xref>) found crop model variation is highest in the middle latitudes and agreed that uncertainties related to the representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and high temperature effects are key. Both note that reducing these uncertainties is vital in order to facilitate adaptation responses.
