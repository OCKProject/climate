<p id="Par44" class="p">Second, further studies are needed on the technical and cost impacts of altered variability of renewable resources, and the impacts of extreme weather events on all elements of the energy system. As the impacts on individual system elements become better understood, research should turn to the combined effects of simultaneous or successive impacts, such as water shortages at times of high cooling demand, or storms hitting already weakened infrastructure. These could entail probabilistic modelling approaches.</p>
