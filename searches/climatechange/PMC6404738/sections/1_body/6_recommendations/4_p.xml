<p id="Par45" class="p">Third, IAMs should be developed to incorporate multiple climate change impacts on the demand and supply side at the same time. Technological and behavioural adaptation options and water competition should be represented to improve the comprehensive examination of the costs, feasibility and optimal timing of energy system decarbonisation pathways. As the variation between GCMs is a key uncertainty, methods should be developed to better reflect the range of climate projections, beyond the use of a climate model ensemble mean.</p>
