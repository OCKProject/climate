<p class="p">A critical step in the global response to climate change is to address the existing inequities in fundamental health-sustaining resources. Widespread access to safe water, adequate shelter, reliable food supplies, resilient sanitation systems, treatment for endemic diseases and gender equality will help to ensure that future generations of children are less likely to be poorly educated, physically and cognitively impaired, stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty and poor health, and thus be unable to reach their full potential. These issues were historically confined to the developing world, but with the recent surges in massive urban slum settlements on the fringes of large cities around the world, these risk factors are now embedded in developed urban populations as well. Similarly, with increasing environmental pressures on rural communities in both developed and developing countries, these risks to child health inequities will not just be challenges in the developing world.</p>
