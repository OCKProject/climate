<p class="p">Protecting and improving child health in a climate-changed world demands that we pay attention to the existing inequities in child survival and development [

 <xref rid="B61-children-01-00461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The existing social and economic gradients in child health outcomes will be amplified by the ability of different populations to protect themselves and their livelihoods in the face of climatic change. Those with more resources, power and influence will be better able to cope with climate-related hazards, to recover from damaging climatic events, and to safely relocate their families if needed. In contrast, the most vulnerable populations will bear the burden of rising morbidity and mortality associated with climate change, including severe storms and droughts, infectious disease epidemics and widespread food insecurity.
