In addition to high mortality rates (around 20%), childhood malaria is associated with acute and long-term neurological, cognitive and physical impairments in around 25% of survivors, including losses in motor function, co-ordination, speech, hearing and vision, as well as psychosis, seizures and epilepsy [
