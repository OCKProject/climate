<p class="p">In malaria-endemic regions, many children build up some immunity as a result of repeated infections in the first 10 years of life [
 <xref rid="B44-children-01-00461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The greatest changes in risk will occur at the current margins of the malaria parasite distribution as rising temperatures allow the mosquito vector to spread into higher altitudes and the desert fringes where malaria is not endemic and the populations therefore have little or no immunity [

 <xref rid="B46-children-01-00461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Low population immunity heightens the risk of severe disease in children, and such epidemics are characterized by much higher mortality rates (up to 10 times higher) than disease in malaria-endemic regions [
 <xref rid="B47-children-01-00461" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In either situation, the persistent effects of malaria infection extend the burden of disease far beyond the conventional measures of morbidity and mortality [
