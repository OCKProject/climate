 <p class="p">The GLORIA master site Schrankogel was established by Georg Grabherr, Michael Gottfried and Harald Pauli with support of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research and the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) through the Austrian Academy of Sciences. This study was financed by the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP 6: GZ B368633, KR13AC6K11076). We thank the Government of Tyrol for providing permission to set up a field camp to conduct the second resurvey of permanent plots, and our colleagues Sophie Nießner, Andreas Berger, Veronika Fasching, Thomas Gassner, Christian Gilli, Claudia Gstöttl, David Paternoster, Norbert Sauberer, Simon Stifter, Hermann Stockinger, Michael Suen and Birgit Weis for their assistance, commitment and perseverance during the field season in 2014. We are grateful to Manfred Bardy‐Durchhalter for the technical support with the database.</p>
