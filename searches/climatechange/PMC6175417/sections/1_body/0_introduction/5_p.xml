<p class="p">After the first decade, an increase in species richness, resulting from colonisations of species into the plots, but hardly any disappearances from the plots, was observed. The novel aspect, however, was the evidence of decreasing abundance of all subnival–nival, i.e. outstandingly cold‐adapted, species (Pauli

Through the third survey in 2014, we assess whether the observed changes in species distribution patterns constitute ongoing trends in relation to recent climate warming by addressing the following four topics and inherent hypotheses. (1) Changes in vascular plant species diversity: (1a) species richness continues to increase, but (1b) the ratio of colonisations vs disappearances shifts towards the latter. (2) Changes in vascular plant cover: (2a) the total cover of vascular plants is increasing because (2b) the continued expansion of more thermophilic alpine and alpine–subnival pioneer species exceeds the ongoing decline of cryophilic high‐elevation species. (3) Changes in community‐weighted ecological indicators: the composition of species and their abundances change directionally in relation to climate trends, resulting in (3a) a thermophilisation of plant communities (Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and (3b) a more drought‐tolerant species composition. (4) Topography and elevation: plots in rugged habitats and in high elevations show lower rates of change, because habitat complexity in rocky terrain as well as low‐temperature conditions buffer against colonisation events and the expansion of established species.
