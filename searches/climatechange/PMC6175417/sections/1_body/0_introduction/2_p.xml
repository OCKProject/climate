<p class="p">The last three decades were globally the warmest on record and, in the northern hemisphere, the period from 1983 to 2012 was probably the warmest of the last 1400 years (Hartmann

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Moreover, global climate warming tends to amplify in high‐elevation areas, compared with lowland areas (Barry,

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Across the European Alps, high‐elevation stations show uniform warming trends of 0.8°C annual mean between 1981 and 2010, and 2.5°C mean from April to June, which is 3.5 times larger than the corresponding northern hemisphere temperature rise (Marty &amp; Meister, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Changes in precipitation show a larger regional and seasonal variability, especially in Europe (Kovats 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, increases in evaporation and atmospheric humidity, as well as reductions in snow amount and snowpack period, are corresponding consequences of climate warming (Jiménez Cisneros 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although the spatial patterns of snow are determined by topography and the prevailing wind direction, the temporal patterns of snowmelt are directly linked to temperature change (Friedel, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1961</xref>; Kirkpatrick 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and snow cover duration in the Alps showed a declining trend during the last decades (Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Cramer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Future scenarios predict a continued shift from snow to rain in mountainous regions, which alone could lead to a significant decrease in snow cover duration in central Europe (Steger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Jiménez Cisneros 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This would result in an increase in the length of the growing seasons, and hence in a potential threat to high‐elevation plant species through the opening of immigration pathways for competitors from lower elevations (Dullinger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Steger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Increased drought risk has already been detected in central Europe over the past century, with surface warming as the primary cause after the mid‐1980s, and can be expected for the region of the Alps in the future (Dai 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Gobiet 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The climatically suitable area of alpine habitats is therefore successively shrinking. Depending on the climate change scenario, model projections suggest a loss of &gt; 80% of habitats in some European mountains, including parts of the Alps, for up to 55% of the alpine species studied, until the end of the century (Engler 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,
