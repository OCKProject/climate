<p class="p">High mountain plants are adapted to low‐temperature conditions (Körner &amp; Larcher, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) and, apart from low latitudes, to a short growing season, which makes them sensitive to increasingly warmer climates. Alpine and subnival plants, however, may respond only little to short‐term climatic oscillations, but rather to longer lasting climatic trends, because most species are persistent, slow growing and long lived; annual and short‐lived species are rare above the treeline (Billings &amp; Mooney, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1968</xref>; Körner,

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). High mountain ecosystems, especially above the alpine grassland zone, are governed by climatic factors, whereas the importance of biotic factors, such as competition among species for light and nutrient resources and direct human impacts, for example through farming and livestock grazing, decreases with elevation. Therefore, changes in the occurrence of alpine and subnival plant species and in the composition of their assemblages are highly relevant as indicators of ecological impacts of climate change (Theurillat &amp; Guisan,
