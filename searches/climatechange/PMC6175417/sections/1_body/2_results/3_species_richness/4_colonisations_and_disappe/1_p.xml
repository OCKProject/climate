<p class="p">The mean number of colonisations decreased significantly from 2.08 species per plot between 1994 and 2004 to 1.76 between 2004 and 2014. The mean number of disappearances increased significantly from 0.31 species per plot in the first decade to 1.29 in the second decade (means calculated from raw data; effect sizes from GLMMs,

 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S9</xref>). No species, however, disappeared completely from the whole area. By contrast, four and seven species were recorded for the first time in 2004 and 2014, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). These new species belonged exclusively to AR3 (one and two new species in 2004 and 2014, respectively) and AR4 (three and five species). Colonisation in relation to previously unoccupied plots was highest among AR1 species (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01; Table 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S11</xref>), whereas there was no change among AR2–4 species. Relative disappearance was fairly low (2–3%) in AR1–3 in the first decade, whereas AR4 species disappeared from almost a quarter of their formerly occupied plots (Fig.

 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S10</xref>). In the second decade, however, relative disappearance increased sharply and significantly by factors of 3.23, 2.65 and 6.9 in species of AR1–3, respectively, whereas AR4 remained stable (GLMMs; Table
