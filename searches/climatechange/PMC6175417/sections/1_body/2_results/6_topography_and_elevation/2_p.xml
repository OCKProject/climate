<p class="p">Plots in the lowest block A had, on average, the largest proportion of scree and vegetation cover, and the lowest proportion of solid rock (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>). Further, they showed the lowest degree of ruggedness and steepness. The nival, that is, highest, block D was the most rugged and steepest block. The topographic parameters (first axis of NMDS; Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S8</xref>) of block A differed significantly from those of blocks B and D; block D differed significantly from all other blocks, whereas blocks B and C were not significantly different (Table
