<p class="p">Changes in species richness in individual blocks showed the same tendencies as in the entire dataset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a; Table 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>), even though the increase in richness stagnated in all blocks, except in block B in the second decade (Table 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). The number of colonisations decreased significantly in block A as over the whole study area, whereas there was no significant change in blocks C and D, and, in block B, colonisations even increased in the second decade. The number of disappearances increased significantly in all blocks as in the entire dataset, except in block D, where no significant change was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b; Tables
