 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>a). Over time, cover sums of AR1 showed a pronounced linear decrease, whereas those of AR2 increased. The mean cover sums per species were highest in AR1 in all 3 years, but decreased significantly over time, whereas there was no change in the other ARs (GLMMs; Fig.
