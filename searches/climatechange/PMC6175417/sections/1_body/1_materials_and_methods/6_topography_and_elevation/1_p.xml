A matrix was built with rescaled parameters for each plot, that is, estimated top cover of surface types (rock, scree, bare soil and vegetation) and topographic parameters (altitude, aspect, slope and ruggedness) derived from a digital elevation model (© Land Tirol). Ruggedness was calculated as the standard deviation of elevation with a 100 × 100 m
