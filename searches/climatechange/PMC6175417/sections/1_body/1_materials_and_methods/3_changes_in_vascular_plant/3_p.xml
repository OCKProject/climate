<p class="p">Colonisations were defined as the number of species per plot present at the time of the resurvey, which were absent in the respective plot at the previous survey, and disappearances were defined as the number of species per plot absent at the time of the resurvey, which were present at the previous survey. These counts were analysed with GLMMs with a negative binomial distribution, with type (colonisation or disappearance) and decade as fixed effects.</p>
