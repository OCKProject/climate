<p class="p">Species richness was calculated as the number of species per plot and survey, and was analysed as Poisson distributed counts with year (i.e. survey) as predictor. Species richness data within the blocks were over‐dispersed (over‐dispersion parameter of the glmer model &gt; 1.2), and therefore the function glmmPQL was used.</p>
