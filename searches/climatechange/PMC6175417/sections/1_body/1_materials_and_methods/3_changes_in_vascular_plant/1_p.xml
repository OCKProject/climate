<p class="p">For the response variables species richness, colonisation and disappearance, here treated as counts, the appropriate distribution for the models was determined by building two generalised mixed‐effects models (GLMMs), one assuming a Poisson distribution and one assuming a negative binomial distribution, which better fits many zero values (zero inflation; glmer and glmer.nb from 
 <sc class="sc">lme</sc>4 package, respectively; Bates

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A likelihood ratio test between these two models was performed (ANOVA function from 
 <sc class="sc">stats</sc> package) to determine the appropriate model in each case (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). For both models, over‐dispersion was tested with the overdisp.glmer function from the RVA
 <sc class="sc">ide</sc>M
 <sc class="sc">emoire</sc> package (Hervé, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In cases of over‐dispersion, the function glmmPQL from the 
 <sc class="sc">mass</sc> package (Venables &amp; Ripley, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) was used, which employs penalised quasi‐likelihood and takes an over‐dispersion parameter into account.
