To determine which AR species group drives the observed changes, species richness and relative colonisation and disappearance events (the proportion of the number of plots not yet occupied in the case of colonisation, and of previously occupied plots in the case of disappearance) were calculated for each AR separately, and the above analyses on species richness were repeated with AR included in the fixed effects. Colonisation and disappearance events were treated as Bernoulli trials (1, successful colonisation of an empty plot or disappearance from an occupied plot of a given species; 0, plot not colonised or species not disappeared from a plot) and modelled as binomial GLMMs (function glmmadmb in package
