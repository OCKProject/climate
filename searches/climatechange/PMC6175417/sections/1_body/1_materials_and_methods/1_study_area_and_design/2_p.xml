Transects were grouped into four blocks (A, B, C and D), where (A) encompasses the uniformly shaped southwest slope which extends uninterruptedly from the alpine grassland belt to the alpine–nival ecotone, (B) encompasses the rugged south‐facing middle, (C) encompasses the rugged south–southeast‐facing eastern part within the ecotone and (D) encompasses the south‐facing, high‐elevation outposts in the nival zone along the east ridge (Fig.
