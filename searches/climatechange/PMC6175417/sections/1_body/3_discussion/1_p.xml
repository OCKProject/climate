<p class="p">Over a decade ago, the first repeated survey of the 10‐yr‐old permanent plots in the alpine–nival ecotone of Schrankogel showed an increase in species numbers similar to other studies, but, most noteworthy, also a divergent change in species abundance, providing the first consistent evidence of population declines of cryophilic species (Pauli

After 20 yr of progressing climate warming, we find that (1) species turnover involves the disappearances of species almost exclusively in the second decade, (2) the decrease in vegetation cover constitutes an ongoing trend over both decades, (3) the plant community transformation towards more thermophilous species assemblages, which are increasingly adapted to drier soil conditions, has accelerated, and (4) differences among the blocks reflect the temperature gradient, topography and connectivity to lower elevation species pools.
