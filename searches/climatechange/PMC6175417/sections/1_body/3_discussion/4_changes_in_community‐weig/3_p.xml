<p class="p">An even stronger amplification effect was detected for the soil moisture indicator (Table 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S21</xref>). Our results show a shift of the species composition towards more drought‐tolerant plant compositions, that is, an aridisation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Delta values of the community‐level soil moisture and thermic indicators were highly negatively correlated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph15290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>), and hence mainly reflect changes in the same species. Yet, this does not necessarily mean that all species experiencing a disadvantage through warmer conditions effectively suffer from drought stress.
