<p class="p">Thermophilisation effects have substantial consequences for subnival plant communities in the alpine–nival ecotone, where AR1 species have the centre of their distribution close to their rear edge (Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). This ecotone was found to strongly coincide with the altitude of the summer snow line (Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Plant assemblages at the ecotone should therefore respond sensitively to warming and associated shifts in temporal patterns of snow duration. High‐altitude weather stations distributed over the central and northern Alps show a uniform temperature increase in annual mean temperatures of 0.8°C during the last three decades (Marty &amp; Meister, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which would correspond to 0.53°C in the period 1994–2014. Using the environmental lapse rate of −0.65°C per 100 m elevation, a temperature increase of 0.53°C corresponds to a difference of 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 80 m in elevation. As an approximation, one unit of the thermic indicator translates roughly to the elevation range of an entire vegetation belt, for example, the alpine belt on Schrankogel ranges from 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 2300 to 2800 m (Dullinger, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). The observed thermophilisation values of 0.06, 0.09 and 0.15 units during the first and second decade, and the 20‐yr period, respectively, thus approximate to 6%, 9% and 15% of a vegetation belt. This is within the same magnitude of change as observed by Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) on the European level (i.e. 5% of one vegetation belt after 7 yr). Given a vegetation belt of a vertical extent of 500 m, the observed change of 0.15 units in the thermic vegetation indicator corresponds to 75 m in elevation. Thus, the vegetation at the alpine–nival ecotone seems to be largely tracking recent climate warming.
