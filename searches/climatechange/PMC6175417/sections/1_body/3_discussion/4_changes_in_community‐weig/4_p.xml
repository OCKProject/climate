<p class="p">Higher temperatures, however, cause greater evapotranspiration, leading to reduced water availability, which alone can increase the probability of drought stress (Beniston, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Regional scenarios on precipitation change are inconsistent; however, projections for central Europe show that mean precipitation tends to decrease in summer and increase in winter (Schmidli 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), with increasingly more rain instead of snow in mountainous regions (Steger 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Snow cover is generally declining in the Alps, although patterns of changes in the amount of snowfall are also rather patchy (Gobiet 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, the significant trend towards a longer annual snow‐free period has been shown to be consistent with reported trends of longer growing seasons (Dye,

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Combined effects of higher temperatures and concomitant drier conditions can result in strong transforming forces on cold‐adapted plant communities (Lesica, 
 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which was also experimentally confirmed (De Boeck
