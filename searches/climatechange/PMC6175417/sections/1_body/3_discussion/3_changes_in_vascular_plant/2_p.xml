 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), suggesting that population declines are occurring more rapidly than range shifts. This could lead, at least transitionally, to a disruption of distribution patterns, rather than to a rapid greening of the alpine–nival ecotone. The importance of directional changes in species cover was also shown in alpine permanent plots in the Montana Rocky Mountains by Lesica (
