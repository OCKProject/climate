<p class="p">The most relevant potential mechanisms underlying the observed patterns are, first, a successive competitive displacement of the high‐elevation species (AR1) through expansion of lower elevation species (AR2, AR3) and, second, direct climatic effects which may deteriorate the performance of cryophilic species. Competition effects, as were verified experimentally (Elmendorf

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), are potentially relevant; however, conspicuous signs of competition pressure, such as for light through taller growing species, are not common at the alpine–nival ecotone, as all species are dwarf‐stature plants. Further, the typical habitats at the alpine–nival ecotone do not have a closed vegetation cover (

Although species of different elevational distribution preferences can grow in the direct neighbourhood, habitats at the alpine–nival ecotone are governed by abiotic, mostly climatic, factors, where the stress gradient hypothesis (Bertness &amp; Callaway,

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) would posit that facilitative interspecific interactions outweigh competitive effects.
