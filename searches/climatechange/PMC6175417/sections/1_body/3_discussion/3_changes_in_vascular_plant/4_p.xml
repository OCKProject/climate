<p class="p">Overall, however, vascular plant cover is decreasing, which suggests that advancing alpine–subnival species (AR2) cannot fill the space released by AR1 species. We therefore assume that direct climatic effects may be of superior relevance for an increasing maladaptation and population decline of cryophilic species. Ecophysiological studies of cryophilic species have not been conducted often, but some species, including several of our AR1 group, have been found to show high heat sensitivity and low ability to acclimate respiration rates to higher temperatures, causing detrimentally high respiration rates, and thus the plants rapidly attain a negative carbon balance (Larigauderie &amp; Körner,

Such metabolic disadvantages may explain the continued population decline even in the absence of competition through higher temperatures alone. Drier conditions, through earlier snowmelt and stronger evapotranspiration, can further deteriorate the situation by leading to lower soil moisture levels, and thus to warmer soils, which could cause detrimentally high root respiration rates (Cooper,
