<p class="p">In conclusion, we argue that a combination of continued temperature rise and decreased snow cover duration has a major impact on the composition, performance and persistence of plant species in subnival communities. This is manifested by an accelerating loss of subnival plant communities in the central Alps. The longevity and persistence abilities of high‐elevation plants may have delayed the disappearance of species from habitats which have become climatically unsuitable (Dullinger

 <xref rid="nph15290-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). Increasing maladaptation of cryophilic high‐elevation species to warmer and longer growing seasons, however, has led to their continued retraction, even in the absence of competitive displacement. An incomplete infilling through succeeding species from lower elevation further suggests that trailing edge dynamics proceed faster than leading edge advances in environments above the alpine grassland zone. If this holds true in further progress, it could imply that the pay‐off of a rising extinction debt (Kuussaari
