<p class="p">Contrary to the others, species patterns in the nival block D were rather stable over the 20‐yr period, which could be explained by the larger distance to the alpine species pool. Obviously, low‐temperature conditions suitable for cryophilic species still prevailed, that is, these populations occurred well above their lower range margin and above the upper margins of alpine species. Block D, however, consisted of fewer plots with fewer species, compared with the others. The results should therefore be treated with some caution.</p>
