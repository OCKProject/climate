 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Spatial distribution of changes in permafrost area on the QTP in the near-term (2011–2040), mid-term (2041–2070), long-term (2071–2099) compared with the baseline period under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Decreased permafrost area indicates that permafrost has degraded to seasonally frozen or non-frozen regions; unchanged permafrost is permafrost that has persisted over different time periods; unchanged seasonally frozen ground indicates areas that are persistently non-permafrost regions.
