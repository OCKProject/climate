<p class="p">Under all climate change scenarios, permafrost is projected to only exist in the northwestern and northeastern QTP, and almost all permafrost in the southern and eastern QTP would disappear. These results are similar to those of Nan

 </sup>, which show that permafrost is expected to only persist in the Qiangtang continuous permafrost zone, and in the Gangdise and Qilian mountains. In the present study, however, there were projected disappearance of permafrost distribution in the Gangdise mountains, and this may be associated with the climate forcing data from the RCP scenarios. Differences may also relate to the fact that snow cover and soil moisture were taken into account in estimating the ground thermal regime in our study. Permafrost area in the eastern and southern QTP and in the foothills surrounding high-elevation areas facing the plateau are expected to decrease more rapidly than in other regions. In general, a permafrost degradation is expected to increase from the outer to the inner plateau.
