<p class="p">Differences between the permafrost map and simulation results may be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there are differences in map boundaries and scale, and the period of data used to produce the map compared with the model. Secondly, applied models are vastly different and also use a wide range of input datasets at various resolutions. Additionally, only a select number of models consider the influence of the thermal regimes of snow, plant and litter cover on energy transfer between the air and the soil, and the effect of land-types, lakes, glaciers and deserts that may all change in response to climate.</p>
