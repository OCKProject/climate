<p class="p">In this research, we used the Surface Frost Number Model to simulate permafrost and seasonal frozen soil or non-frozen soil distribution on the QTP over different time periods. Snow is critical for atmosphere and lithosphere coupling

 </sup> indicated ground temperature in permafrost regions of the QTP not only are controlled by regional zonations of latitude, longitude and elevation, but also significantly affected by local environmental factors including vegetation, snow cover, surface water conditions, and geological structure. The distribution of snow depth on the QTP shows obviously spatial heterogeneity, which snow cover in mountainous regions of the eastern, southern, and interior QTP are deeper than those in high plains, valleys and basins in the interior of QTP. The snow cover is thick and has long duration in the area with stability of snow, which plays a role in insulating thermal for the shallow ground. If snow thick is more than 20 cm, the role of insulation will be enhanced. However, in the area with thinner snow in the warm season, the influence of snow cover on the shallow ground will be cooling due to the existence of snow with short time

 </sup>. Therefore, snow cover on the QTP might heavily affect the thermal regime of permafrost. Inter-annual percentage variations in snow depth on the QTP relative to the average of the baseline term under the four RCP scenarios are shown in Fig.

The annual snow depth under RCP8.5 scenario would decrease at a rate of approximately 12.49 mm/yr from 2011 to 2099. Moreover, soil moisture also controls heat transmission between air and soil. Therefore, permafrost distribution assessments based on energy balance

 </sup> may overestimate permafrost area due to neglecting the influence of snow, litter cover and soil moisture. These uncertainties are particularly relevant to simulations of future permafrost distribution. This study therefore uses the Surface Frozen Number model to include the influences of heterogeneous snow cover and soil moisture on the ground thermal regime under different RCP scenarios.
