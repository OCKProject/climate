<p class="p">Temperature is a fundamental factor in controlling permafrost distribution. Global mean surface temperature is projected to increase 1.5 °C under the lowest-emission RCP scenario and 4.5 °C under the highest-emission RCP scenario relative to pre-industrial levels by 2100

 </sup>. In China, the projected rate of temperature increase would be 0.06 °C/decade and 0.63 °C/decade under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, and warming trends would be stronger in the northern regions than in the southern regions

 </sup>. The decrease in permafrost area would be more pronounced under the RCP8.5 scenario (approximately 62.0%) than under the RCP2.6 scenario (approximately 18.7%), which would be consistent with climate warming until the end of the 21

 </sup> and the extent of temperature increase under the condition of permafrost existing. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, temperature would increase slightly in all time periods, corresponding to slight changes in permafrost area. In this projection, sporadic and discontinuous permafrost would disappear in the mid-term in the eastern QTP and Gangdise mountains; by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, the greatest temperature increase would occur in the Gangdise mountains and the southern Qiangtang Plateau, and continuous permafrost in the southern Qingtang Plateau would shrink northward.
