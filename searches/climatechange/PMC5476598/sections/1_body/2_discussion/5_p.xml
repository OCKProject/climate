<p class="p">Under climate warming scenarios, the permafrost distribution on the QTP is expected to shrink toward the northwest. In the long-term, permafrost areas on the QTP are predicted to decrease by 22.44%, 43.67%, 46.08% and 64.31% under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The rate of decrease under the RCP8.5 scenario is similar to results from Zhang

 </sup> neglected permafrost distribution responses to climate change, and climate data from 1950 to 2000 were used as a baseline for estimating changes in permafrost area in the future. In the present study, climate data from 1981â€“2010 were used for the baseline period, which is more reliable for simulation accuracy assessment.
