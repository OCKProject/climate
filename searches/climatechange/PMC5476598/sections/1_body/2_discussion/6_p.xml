 </sup> also used an altitude model to show that loss of permafrost area would exceed 58% if air temperature increased on the QTP by an average of 2.91 °C by 2099. Reasons for discrepancies between these studies and the present analysis may be differences in temperature increase scenarios and the lack of consideration of snow cover in previous research.
