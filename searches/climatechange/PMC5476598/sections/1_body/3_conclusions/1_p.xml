<p class="p">Using the Surface Frozen Number Model, this study adjusts the “surface frozen number” F
 <sub class="sub">+</sub> value to classify frozen soil areas with F
 <sub class="sub">+</sub>  ≥ 0.5 as regions of permafrost and other areas as seasonally frozen soil or non-frozen soil ground. Simulations of permafrost distribution were produced for the baseline period, near-term, mid-term, and long-term under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Rates of permafrost degradation were also analyzed between different periods under different scenarios.
