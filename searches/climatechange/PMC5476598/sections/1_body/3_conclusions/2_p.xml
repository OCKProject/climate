<p class="p">The area of simulated permafrost in the baseline period is 1.66 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Permafrost area on the QTP is expected to decrease in response to climate warming. In the near-term, permafrost degradation is projected to result in an average loss of about 18% for all climate change scenarios. The rate of permafrost decrease is expected to be faster in the mid-term with the largest degradation rate under RCP8.5 and the smallest under RCP2.6. In the long-term, permafrost areas on the QTP are projected to decrease by 22.44%, 43.67%, 46.08% and 64.31% under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Permafrost degradation would mainly occur in the eastern and southern QTP and around the boundaries of the continuous permafrost zone. By the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, simulations show that most permafrost would have retreated into the Qiangtang Plateau.
