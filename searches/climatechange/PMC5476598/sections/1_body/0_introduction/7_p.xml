<p class="p">In this study, soil temperature at 20 cm depth was simulated by the Lund–Potsdam–Jena (LPJ) dynamic vegetation model that considers the effects of soil moisture, snow depth and litter thickness on soil temperature. This output was used to drive the Surface Frost Number model for simulating permafrost distribution under different climate change scenarios.</p>
