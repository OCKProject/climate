<p class="p">Because permafrost is a subsurface feature, its distribution cannot be readily estimated using remote sensing data. Further, owning to the high cost and difficulty in accessing many permafrost regions, the distribution is also difficult to map via field investigations. Model simulations are therefore an effective approach, especially for projections of future permafrost distribution. Permafrost distribution on the QTP has been simulated by different models, including the Altitude Model

 </sup>. The results indicated that, under a scenario of 0.02 °C/yr air temperature increase, permafrost area on the QTP would decrease by 8.8% in the next 50 years and by 13.4% in the next 100 years. Under a scenario of 0.05 °C/yr air temperature increase, permafrost would decrease by about 13.5% and 46% after 50 and 100 years, respectively. Using the Community Land Model (CLM4), Guo and Wang
