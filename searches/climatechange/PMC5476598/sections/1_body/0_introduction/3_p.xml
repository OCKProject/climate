<p class="p">Due to the combined effects of both climate warming and human activity, the QTP is experiencing remarkable permafrost degradation, such as shortened durations of below-freezing temperatures, shrunk permafrost surface areas, deepened the active layer, increased ground temperatures and rose the lower limit of permafrost

 </sup>. Permafrost degradation has resulted in a series of environmental issues, including decreases in the number of species, a lower water table, modifications to surface and subsurface hydrology, and changes in energy and carbon exchange between the soil and atmosphere. Loss of permafrost has also threated the safety of engineering construction projects

 </sup>. Since extensive permafrost degradation has already caused environmental deterioration, it is of great importance to identify changes in permafrost areas on the QTP to further help identify any ecological or environmental effects.
