 </sup> used data from 197 observation stations to analyze temperature change on the QTP. They showed that the QTP experienced significant warming since the mid-1950s, especially in winter. The annual rate of temperature increase from 1955 to 1996 was approximately 0.16 °C/decade, and the winter temperature increase was 0.32 °C/decade. This winter increase exceeded other areas at the same latitude in the Northern Hemisphere over the same period
