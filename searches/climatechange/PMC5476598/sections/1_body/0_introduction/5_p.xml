<p class="p">Previous research on permafrost distribution has often neglected thermal exchange between the atmosphere and land surface through snow, plant and litter cover, which is very important for permafrost occurrence

 </sup>. Moreover, relationships between air and subsurface temperatures are often considered as a linear function to simplify model algorithms that use air temperature or climate scenario data to simulate permafrost distribution. Snow cover is a crucial factor in identifying permafrost

 </sup>, and variation in soil moisture affects temporal and spatial changes in permafrost distribution. Thus, the consideration of the way that thermal regimes of soil moisture, snow, plant and litter cover influence energy transfer between the air and the soil will make the simulation results more reliable and reasonable.
