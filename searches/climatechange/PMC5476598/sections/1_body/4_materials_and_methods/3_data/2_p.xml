 </sup>. GCM output covers the period 1981–2099, and was downscaled to a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). A bias correction was performed on the ISI-MIP dataset using a statistical approach to preserve absolute or relative trends in simulated daily climate data, with the bias‒corrected daily variables including the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures (K); precipitation (kg·m

 </sup>. The ensemble average was employed in this study to reduce uncertainty in GCM performance. Moreover, anomalies calculated from the difference between observed data and ISI-MIP data over the baseline period (1981–2010) were added to scenario data to provide model input for the scenario period (2011–2099).
