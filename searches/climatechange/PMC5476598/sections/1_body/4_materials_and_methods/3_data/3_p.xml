<p class="p">To estimate future permafrost distribution, the GCM ensemble average for each F
 <sub class="sub">+</sub> value was calculated for each of the four emission scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Four 30-year periods were used to analyze spatial and temporal variations in permafrost distribution as follows: the baseline period (1981–2010); and near-term (2011–2040), mid-term (2041–2070) and long-term (2071–2099) periods. Rates of permafrost change were calculated for each grid as the differences between the baseline period and the near-term, mid-term and long-term periods under different scenarios. Albers equal-area projection was applied during the computation to eliminate area distortion.
