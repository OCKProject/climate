<p class="p">Climate data from 603 meteorological stations in China for the period 1981 to 2010 were obtained from the National Meteorological Center of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). Data were interpolated with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° using the thin-spline plate method. Climate variables, including daily mean, maximum and minimum air temperatures, mean relative humidity, mean wind speed and sunshine duration were extracted from the dataset for the QTP. These data were then used to force simulated permafrost distribution. Data gaps were filled using long-term average values from the same station.</p>
