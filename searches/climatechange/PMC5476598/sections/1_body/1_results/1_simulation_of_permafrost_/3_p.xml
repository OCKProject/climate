 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) shows that the spatial distribution of modeled permafrost distribution is consistent with the Kappa value of 0.51 and 0.46, respectively. The result is considered a high agreement according to criteria from Monserud and Leemans

 </sup>, and the consistencies were 75.4% and 70.2%, respectively. Simulated permafrost distribution in the eastern QTP is slightly larger than for the two frozen ground maps, with seasonal frozen ground displaced by permafrost in the northern Gangdise and Himalaya mountains. Compared with the frozen ground maps, simulated permafrost distribution in the southern Qiangtang Plateau is significantly larger than that from Li and Cheng

 </sup>. This study classifies predominantly continuous permafrost, isolated permafrost and alpine permafrost as permafrost, and the other areas as seasonally frozen ground. In the simulation results, permafrost is mainly distributed in regions between the Kunlun and Gangdise mountains, and the Qilian mountains.
