<p class="p">In the mid-term, areas of decreased permafrost are mainly distributed in the southern Qiangtang Plateau, the eastern QTP and the surrounding Qilian mountains. In contrast to near-term simulations, the RCP8.5 scenario exhibits the largest decrease in permafrost area, while the RCP2.6 scenario shows the smallest decrease. Compared with the baseline period, the decrease in permafrost area in the mid-term is fastest under the RCP8.5 scenario, with a decrease in area of about 0.69 × 10
