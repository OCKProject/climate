<p class="p">The distribution of permafrost can be affected by climate change. Permafrost distribution in the near-term, mid-term and long-term under different climate change scenarios is illustrated in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The spatial distribution of permafrost is similar in the three periods under the RCP2.6 scenario, implying that permafrost would not be greatly affected by climate change. Changes in permafrost under RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios show a similar pattern, with the permafrost area being largest in the near-term, followed by the mid-term and then long-term. The degradation of permafrost under the RCP8.5 scenario is more severe than for other scenarios, especially in the long-term.
