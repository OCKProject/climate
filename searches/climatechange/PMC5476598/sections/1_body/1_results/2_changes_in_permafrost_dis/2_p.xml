 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> show changes in permafrost distribution on the QTP during different periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios compared with the baseline period. Under the four climate change scenarios, a slight degradation in permafrost is observed in the near-term. Areas of decreased permafrost are distributed at the boundary between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, and are mainly located in the southwestern and eastern QTP. The RCP4.5 scenario shows the most severe degradation of permafrost in the near-term, with a permafrost decrease of 0.30 × 10
