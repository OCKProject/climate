 <p class="p">The authors would like to thank to all students and researchers that contributed to the inventory of bryophytes, vascular plants and arthropods in the last decade within long-term research projects of Azorean Biodiversity Group. The authors would also like to thank Dr. Miguel Araújo for his invaluable contributions to the species distribution modelling and manuscript revision.</p>
 <p class="p">Maria Teresa Ferreira was funded by the Azorean Regional Fund for Science and Technology and the Pro-Emprego for funding her grant within the project “Implications of climate change for Azorean Biodiversity—IMPACTBIO” [M2.1.2/I/005/2011].</p>
 <p class="p">Data on species distributions was gathered based on the EU projects INTERREGIII B “ATLÂNTICO” (2004–2006) and BIONATURA (2006–2008), and more recently also ATLANTISMAR—“Mapping coastal and marine biodiversity of the Azores” (Ref: M2.1.2/I/027/2011) and “MOVECLIM—Montane vegetation as listening posts for climate change” (Ref: M2.1.2/F/04/2011/NET).</p>
 <p class="p">The climatic modelling work of EBA was developed in the framework of the project PROAAcXXIs–Projecções das Alterações Climáticas nos Açores para o século XXI. (PO_Açores 2020 –Eixo Prioritário 1 –Açores-01-0145 –FEDER—000037).</p>
