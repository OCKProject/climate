<p class="p">For São Miguel Island the PRION projections for all groups extend the projected protected areas beyond the current protected areas (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g003" class="xref">3</xref>), while for Terceira this is not the case. The bryophytes and vascular plants have a similar pattern for São Miguel Island showing similar values of current PAs’ effectiveness (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s003" class="xref">S3</xref> Figs). Arthropods show a different pattern (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>) where the PAs efficiency is higher for both islands but more so in Terceira than in São Miguel. For the projection maps from PRION the obtained areas for the minimum set are smaller than the areas obtained by the maximum coverage (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g002" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g003" class="xref">3</xref>) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s007" class="xref">S7</xref> Figs). This difference is more evident in the projections for the period 2080–99, where the loss of potential distribution range of the species seems to require less protected area in a minimum set scenario. The analysis where more weight was given to the Single Island Endemics (
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) show a similar pattern for the efficiency, but with much lower values. The projected areas are also located outside the existing PA’s, but with a more scattered pattern (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g004" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). Nevertheless, the results for the performance of the protected areas (current and projected) for each species showed that these solutions were all better than a random set of protected cells (
