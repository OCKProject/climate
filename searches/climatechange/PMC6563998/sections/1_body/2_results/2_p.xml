<p class="p">Considering the potential distribution of species only within the boundaries of the current PAs, there is a loss from one period to the other. The mean loss of potential distribution within the protected areas in the future projections in vascular plants is as much as 37±4% while the arthropods will have a 50±3% loss (
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). There is a reduction in the overall distribution of the species from one time period to the other, although for Terceira the current protected areas still contain much of the diversity within its boundaries (
