<p class="p">Additional analyses are necessary, however, in order to maximize protection of important endemic species within PAs, particularly SIE species. In this case we found that when more weight is given to SIEs (Figs

Not knowing what species contribute to what ecosystem services means that the full consequences of species extinctions are extremely hard to predict [
