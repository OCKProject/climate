<p class="p">The proportion of species climate potential distribution inside the current PA’s was found to increase from the 1961–1990 period to the 2080–2099 period (
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), especially for Terceira. This happens because the potential distribution of the species actually decreases from one time period to the other, and proportionately the percentage of the species distribution that is covered by the current PA’s increases. However, when we compare the species potential distribution only inside the PA’s (
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), there is actually a decrease by over 33±5% for Terceira Island for example. This shows how important it is to have all the information possible in order to make well-founded recommendations when it comes to PAs.
