<p class="p">We were able to ascertain through PRION that the current PAs are still a better solution than just a random spread of protected cells, as would be expected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s013" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). However, because most PAs have fixed boundaries, they will not protect the populations of the species whose distributions move in response to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Some modelling studies have shown species to move out of reserves due to climate change and as a result may require additional protected areas to achieve conservation in the future [
