<p class="p">There are many species whose projected distribution for the 1961–1990 period are outside the protected areas, even if the number of species per cell is higher inside these compared with non-protected areas. However, with the impacts of climate change we project a decrease in number of species per cell inside the current protected areas considering all the species together (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218168.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). From the analysis, we saw that on average less than 53±16% of the species distributions are covered by the current protected areas. This means that for most of the species their range of distribution is outside protected areas, which can increase extinction risk due to human infrastructure and associated stressors [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>) do not cover most of the species projected distribution under climate change. This type of information is important because species distribution models can be used as a frame of reference for setting objectives of conservation within an adaptive framework (a basic system of measures that can be adapted as needed)[
