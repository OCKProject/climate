<p class="p">The results from our work show that protected areas may need more frequent revision, especially for cases like islands, where climate change is predicted to have a strong negative effect on biodiversity loss, as is the case of the Azores [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and for all Macaronesian islands in the case of the bryophytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Because island space is limited, competition with anthropogenic uses is a potential generator of conflict. Studies have shown that a dynamic strategy for the creation of protected areas can be more effective than just adding protected areas to the existing ones under a climate change scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The solution can be to release some of these areas where they may no longer be effective in the future in order to add different areas and so this may be more appealing to the decision makers [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Recently a study found that public and private protection led to different patterns of positive employment impacts indicating the importance of investing in both types of land protection to increase local opportunities. In addition, they found that the greatest magnitude of employment impacts were due to protection in more rural areas, where opportunities for both visitation and amenity-related economic growth may be greatest [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. When we look at land use maps for the protected areas that are projected by the PRION (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s009" class="xref">S9</xref> Figs), we see that these are mainly planted forests and pastures. These areas can easily receive a level of protection (Category V of IUCN- Protected Landscape) that does not interfere with their use. Such protection can maintain important landscapes, and associated nature conservation along with other values created through traditional management practices. This could be the case for pasture land that maintains much of the native diversity. Studies have found that semi-natural pastures and exotic forests in the Azores seem to play an important role as corridors between natural forests for both endemic and native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. For the case of the Azores, the regional government has a cautionary principle when creating protected areas (article 4, number 1 of the law decree DLR n.Â° 15/2012/A). It is the regional and local government right and obligation to ensure that there is an effective protection of the landscape. The recommendations for creating or changing protected areas is the responsibility of the environmental directorate with the help of experts that monitor and survey the different protected areas in the Azores. New boundaries or changes to the protected areas can be proposed (based on expert advice, and now using tools like PRION) and public consultation should be performed before any changes are taken into effect. Although the process to change or revise the current protected areas can be challenging it is important to allow the information on best practices to reach not only the decision makers but also the public. The use of different tools can provide useful information to the decision makers e.g., the use of remote sensing to delineate possible
