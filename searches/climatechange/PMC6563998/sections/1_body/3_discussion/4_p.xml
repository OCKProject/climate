<p class="p">The PRION software offers the chance to not only evaluate the effectiveness of current PAs, but it also allows for a projection of optimized areas considering the future distribution of species, allowing for a more effective response to climate change. Even though the existing PAs are projected to yield the highest number of species within the islands from all the three taxonomic groups in the 2080â€“99 period, when compared with the scenarios of Minimum Set or Maximum Coverage these are less effective. This shows that there are spots where the species may be protected that have not been considered and that may represent 
 <italic class="italic">refugia</italic> in the future under climate change conditions. The concept of 
 <italic class="italic">refugia</italic> (or 
 <italic class="italic">microrefugia</italic>) has been extensively studied looking into past events [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. However when looking into the future, seldom do studies look into the climatic change at a local scale or consider the topographic variations that can affect the possible 
 <italic class="italic">refugia</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this study, these variables have been taken into account. These projections show that these areas that can be possible future 
 <italic class="italic">refugia</italic> may be important for the future PA management. Considering the two scenarios tested for the future distributions we can see that current PAs may be expanded. Indeed, there is a need to further evaluate where these could be placed in order to ensure that the maximum protection possible will be given in the future. Shifts in distribution of hotspots for rare species due to climate change under different future scenarios have been shown for beetles such that existing PAs system were inadequate for assuring the conservation of these species [
