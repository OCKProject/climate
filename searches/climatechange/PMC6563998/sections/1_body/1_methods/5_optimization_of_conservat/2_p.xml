<p class="p">In order to determine if the existing conservation areas are optimized to for supporting current and future species distributions, we used PRION: PRIority Optimization aNalysis v0.11 (

This software uses a stochastic global optimization technique, which is a technique that uses mathematical optimization for selecting the best element within given criteria. In this case, the software uses genetic algorithms [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] (which are simple to implement) that use operators such as mutation, crossover and selection, to maximize the representation of features of interest (species) while minimizing the costs of each option (in the simplest case the number of cells to be protected). In this case, we used the default genetic criteria in the software,

 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. a crossover rate of 90.0 (out of 100) and a mutation rate of 50.0 (out of 100). We used an initial population size of 1000 and ran the software for 100000 generations. The software allows creation of a potential network of areas that will maximize protection of a population of a given species using the minimum area necessary (in this case number of cells). A weighted combination of representation (number of cells), cost and connectivity produces a fitness value for each solution explored by the algorithm. In this particular implementation, the analysis is spatially-explicit, in the sense that all steps of the algorithm are made directly using the spatial raster layers [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. For this case, nearby cells have higher probabilities of belonging to the same protection class (in the simplest case either protected or unprotected). Both targets and costs may be used as restrictions, i.e., solutions that do not reach all targets or that exceed the maximum cost have low or null fitness [
