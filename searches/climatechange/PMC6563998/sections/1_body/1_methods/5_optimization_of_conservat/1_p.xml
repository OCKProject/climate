<p class="p">The distribution maps for each species were overlaid using the DIVA-GIS software [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], creating maps of cumulative number of species per cell, for each taxonomic group and for each time period. The maps of the distributions, both present and future, were overlaid with the existing protected areas and the proportion of species distribution area covered by these was calculated. The mean proportion of species suitable climate space covered by current protected areas was calculated by dividing the number of cells of the suitable climate space for each species that was located inside the current protected areas by the total number of cells of species suitable climate space on the islands. We then calculated the mean of these proportions per taxonomic group, per time period. The mean loss of species suitable climate space within current protected areas was calculated as the difference in number of cells within the protected areas between the two time periods divided by the total number of cells within the protected area, per species. We then calculated the mean of the total per taxonomic group, per island.
