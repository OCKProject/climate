<p class="p">Both the ‘minimum set’ and ‘maximum coverage’ were run for each individual taxonomic group and for the complete set of species in the study. The statistical significance of results was also assessed comparing them to the outcomes from null models in order to assess if these solutions were better than expected by chance in achieving overall and species targets. The null models consisted of simple random resampling with no further restrictions. We ran these for both time periods. For the time period of 2080–2099, we did not use the species whose distribution for this period had no projected suitable climate space.</p>
