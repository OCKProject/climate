<p class="p">We assembled climate, topography, and geology data for the two islands into a comprehensive database. Raster layers were built at a resolution of 100 x 100 m corresponding to UTM grid-cells. Altitude, slope and aspect were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) of 100 m spatial resolution. The DEM was developed by interpolating the values of altitude isolines from the Digital Chart (DC) provided by the Cartographic Service of the Portuguese Army. For the climatic data, we used the CIELO Model [

 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], run under the framework of the Project PROAAcXXIs (2016). The CIELO model is a simple layer model, based on the transformations experienced by an air mass crossing over a mountain, and simulates the change in the physical properties from the sea level up to the mountain. The model has been developed in a raster GIS environment and can be applied in order to get an appropriate spatial distribution of any specific climatic variable over the island. Using the capabilities of the GIS, namely integrating other different spatially distributed parameters, the model CIELO can combine several climatic variables and produce spatially detailed distribution outputs.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s011" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). To minimize collinearity among climatic variables, ordination techniques were applied to reduce the multidimensional space to a new subset of factors that characterized the main trends of environmental variation on the islands. Here we use three climatic variables: maximum annual temperature (tmax), minimum annual precipitation (ppmin), and annual range of precipitation (prange). Two time periods were modelled: 1961–1990, and 2080–2099. The choice of the baseline period of 1961–1990 is based on the recommendations of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which endorses the use of this time period as the baseline for climate change impact studies. The CIELO model run for the future (2080–2099) was based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios from the fifth Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. We deliberately chose the “worst case scenario” RCP8.5 because it is consistent with both the historical and current trends of greenhouse gas emissions [

 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The original spatial resolution of the climatic model was of 100m x 100 m and later resampled to 500m x 500m to match species data.
