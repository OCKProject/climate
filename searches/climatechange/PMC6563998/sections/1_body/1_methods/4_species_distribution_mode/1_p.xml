<p class="p">A set of species distribution models (SDMs) was generated for each species, using off-the-shelf BIOENSEMBLES software [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. BIOENSEMBLES is a platform for projecting species distributions that includes 14 different ecological niche modelling techniques and advanced consensus projecting methodologies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218168.s012" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. It is a windows-based program written in Delphi that integrates with R [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and with the Java-based Maxent [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Species distribution models were generated for each modelling technique, and evaluated by performing ten random splits of the species distribution data into two sets: the calibration set, with 80% of the data, used to create the models and the validation set, with the remaining 20% of the data, used to evaluate model performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This evaluation was done using True Skill Statistics (TSS) method [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], in which accuracy values vary between −1 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and values of zero or less indicate a performance no better than random. All models with TSS smaller than zero were discarded and the remaining models were evenly weighted into a consensus model of species potential distributions This ensemble model was projected for two sets of climate conditions, pertaining to two time periods: 1961–1990 (a baseline scenario) and 2080–2099 (a future scenario). In the resulting consensus maps of species potential distributions according to their climate niches, species are only considered as potentially present in a given cell if this presence is predicted by at least half of the models used.
