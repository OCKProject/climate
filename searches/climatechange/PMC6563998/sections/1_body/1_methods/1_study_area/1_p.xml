<p class="p">The Azorean archipelago stretches out over 615 km in the North Atlantic Ocean (37–40°N, 25–31°W), 1584 km west of mainland Portugal and 2150 km east of the North American continent. It is comprised of nine main islands of recent volcanic origin, distributed in three groups: the western group of Corvo and Flores; the central group of Faial, Pico, Graciosa, São Jorge, and Terceira; and the eastern group of São Miguel and Santa Maria. The current protected areas were established in 2007 with nine Island Nature Parks (one for each island). The criteria used to delineate the Nature Parks (Protected Areas) were the ones developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assigning different categories of protection to existing (Natura 2000, Ramsar sites, regional woodland reserves, etc.) and potential natural sites [
