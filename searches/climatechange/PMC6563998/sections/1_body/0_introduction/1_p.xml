<p class="p">Protected areas are created nowadays not only to maintain iconic landscapes and seascapes and ensure biodiversity conservation, but also to play a key part in the mitigation of, and/or adaptation to, climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. A common assumption is that successful conservation within protected areas is possible when these areas are managed to buffer against the processes that threaten them [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, it is becoming clear that in addition to providing sustainable management of habitats and ecosystems, effective conservation strategies need to mitigate the impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The main question is whether species range retention areas or critical areas for dispersal are covered by existing protected areas and whether there are tools to identify critical areas for biodiversity conservation in a changing climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the threats imposed by climate change often compound conventional threats associated with habitat degradation, pollution, poaching, and spread of alien invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Conservation planning is thus facing a major challenge: the need to identify climate

 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] as well as to account for new and dynamic threats emerging from climate change and their interactions with other stressors [
