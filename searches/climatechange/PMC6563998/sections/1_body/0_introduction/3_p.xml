<p class="p">One of the great challenges for adaptation of species under climate change is the ability to move between protected areas as climate change may result in currently occupied areas (or locations) becoming unsuitable. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, the capacity of species to move into new areas as climate suitability shifts is likely to vary across taxa and regions. Modelling studies have shown that some species would be able to persist within existing protected areas or track climate suitability by moving into adjacent protected areas. Studies have shown that there has been a shift in distribution from groups as distinct as trees, shrubs, mammals and insects [

 <xref rid="pone.0218168.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In some other cases, species could experience a shift in suitable habitat that is beyond their dispersal capacities [
