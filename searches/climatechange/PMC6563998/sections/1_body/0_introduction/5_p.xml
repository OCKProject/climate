<p class="p">In order to investigate the implications of climate change to the design of protected areas we: i) analyze the sensitivity of Azorean biodiversity to projected climate changes using species distribution models (SDMs) and compare projections of species potential distributions for bryophytes, vascular plants, and arthropods between 1961–1990 and 2080–2099 (we chose these time periods because they are the standard periods recommended by the IPCC); and ii) evaluate the effectiveness with which the current protected areas of the islands of São Miguel and Terceira retain potential distributions of species under climate change scenarios and identify new priority areas for biodiversity conservation using spatial planning optimization techniques.</p>
