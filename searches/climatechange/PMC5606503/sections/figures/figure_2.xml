  <p class="p">Box plot of changes in total U.S. runoff and water requirements (calculated as the sum over all basins) in the future (2041–2050) relative to the present (2005–2014). The boxes are computed over the five‐member ensemble with different representation of natural variability for the CS3.0 REF, CS3.0 POL4.5, and CS3.0 POL3.7, and over the 15‐member ensemble that include three different values of climate sensitivity and five different representation of natural variability for “All REF.” The boxes represent the range of projections between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The lines inside the boxes represent the median predictions. The whiskers represent upper and lower values.</p>
