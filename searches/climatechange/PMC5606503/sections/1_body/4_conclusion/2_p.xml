<p class="p">This study describes the application of the IGSM‐WRS‐US, a model of U.S. water resource systems, to estimate the effect of climate change and socioeconomic drivers on water stress and the resulting impact on crop productivity. To this end, a yield reduction module was integrated into the modeling framework. It is unique in its consistent treatment of the complex interactions between the climatic, biological, physical, and economic elements of the system. It identifies areas of potential stress in the absence of specific adaptive responses at the 99 river basin level for the continental United States through 2050 under a large ensemble of integrated economic and climate scenarios, including different GHG mitigation policies for the most commonly irrigated crops in the United States. On average, we find that irrigation in the Western part of the country will be affected by an increase in water shortages, with particular basins seeing severe increases in water stress. As a result we identify various basins where current irrigation is not sustainable. At the national level, however, climate and socioeconomic changes will entail an overall reduction in water stress and its effect on irrigated yields for all crops, except for forage and cotton. GHG mitigation policies are effective at limiting the detrimental effect of climate change on irrigated cotton and forage yields, but results show that a stringent policy (CS3.0 POL3.7) is necessary to considerably reduce the number of strongly affected basins. Overall, our study shows potential for adaptation strategies, such as improvements in irrigation efficiency to reduce irrigation demand, but also relocation of irrigated cropland to regions less prone to water stress, to further develop irrigated agriculture in the coming decades. At the same time, these adaptation measures will be costly, as they will require relocation of agricultural production and transport capacity. Additionally, regions which are projected to be irrigation‐constrained will lose irrigation's implicit value as an insurance mechanism against droughts and other adverse effects of climate change. Our study points to the areas and crops which will bear the burden of these costs.</p>
