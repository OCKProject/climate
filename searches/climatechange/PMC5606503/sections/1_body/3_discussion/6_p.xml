<p class="p">Our modeling framework does not track feedbacks from sectoral water stress to economic activity. There is also no measure of adaptation taken to prevent water stress and no land‐use change from areas where water is scarce to locations with greater water availability. International trade is also not taken into account as a response to water‐stressed activities in the United States. These aspects are intentionally not considered in order to estimate the effect of climate change on irrigated cropping under actual conditions and therefore identify the areas the most vulnerable to irrigation shortages in the future. Also, our analysis focuses on crop yield factor relative to a potential fully irrigated crop. However, we do not simulate change in irrigated yield caused by changes in temperature. As shown in
