<p class="p">It should be noted that this study only considers a single‐integrated assessment model and thus does not explore the structural uncertainty associated with different economic, climate, and water resources models. Existing studies of the effect of climate policies on water stress generally place little emphasis on uncertainty—for example,

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>] only consider two climate simulations from a single climate model. However, we know that the choice of pattern of precipitation change (associated with the climate model employed in this analysis) can greatly influences the outcome of the water model, with larger water stresses projected under a dry climate pattern than under a wet pattern [

In this study, we attempt to investigate the overall uncertainty in our results by considering multiple socioeconomic and GHG mitigation scenarios, different representations of natural variability, as well as different global climate system responses (via different climate sensitivities). Our results show a large range of impacts on irrigated crop yields when considering such a large ensemble of integrated economic and climate scenarios, and highlight the considerable uncertainty associated with natural variability in particular.
