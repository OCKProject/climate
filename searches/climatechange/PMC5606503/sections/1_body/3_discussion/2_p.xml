<p class="p">In this study, we project that by 2050, under a wide range of emissions scenarios and climate change projections, a number of U.S. basins will start experiencing water shortages while several basins will see their existing shortages severely accentuated. As a result, irrigated yields in these basins will be reduced, in extreme cases to levels that are only 10% of optimal irrigated yields. Our findings thus suggest that crop modeling studies that do not account for changes in the availability of irrigation water under varying socioeconomic drivers and climate change, in essence assuming optimal irrigated crop yields, can be misleading. However, the basins affected by water shortages generally do not contain most of the irrigated cropland areas. Therefore, while our analysis suggests that cropland expansion and land‐use change decisions can be constrained by water availability for irrigation, it also indicates a large potential for relocation of irrigated agriculture from water‐stressed regions to regions where irrigated agriculture is more sustainable. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of considering the integrated effect of climate change and socioeconomic stressors on water resources and crop yields at a detailed river basin level: water stress is highly localized and disaggregation at the 99 river basin level is necessary to estimate the impact of water shortage on irrigation water availability and resulting crop yields.</p>
