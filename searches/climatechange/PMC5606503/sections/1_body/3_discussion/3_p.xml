<p class="p">At the U.S.‐wide level, our results show that under a no‐policy scenario, future irrigated yields factors, for all crops except forage and cotton, are projected to be higher than in the present. This increase in irrigated crop yield factors is driven by increased water availability in important growing basins but also by a reduction in irrigation demand thanks, in part, to increased crop water use efficiency caused by higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations. When considering GHG mitigation policies, results show that, in the absence of adaptation, mitigation policies enhance future yield factors for all crops, and even offset the projected decrease in irrigated cotton yield factor. In particular, we show that reductions in water stress associated with GHG mitigation under both policies far offsets the negative impact from reduced CO
