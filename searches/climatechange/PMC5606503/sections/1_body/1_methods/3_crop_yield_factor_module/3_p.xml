 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Ky</styled-content> is a crop yield response factor that represents the sensitivity of crop yields to a reduction in evapotranspiration due to water shortage. Values for this parameter are also sourced from the CropWat model and reported in Table 
 <xref rid="eft2229-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>. For crops that are very sensitive to water shortage have 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Ky</styled-content> &gt; 1 and the yield reduction is proportionally larger than the reduction in water use. 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Ky</styled-content> &lt; 1 applies to crops that are more tolerant to water deficits and for which yields decrease less than proportionally to water use reduction. Crop water requirements depend on the crop‐growing stage [

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>]. Out of the four stages (initial, development, mid‐season, and late season) usually considered, the third ‘mid‐season’ stage, corresponding to the flowering and yield formation, is the period of greatest water need. Therefore, a water shortage within this season will have the largest detrimental effect on crop yields. We therefore use values of 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Ky</styled-content> which are specific to each of the four growing stages, 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">gsc</styled-content>. The values are consistent with those employed by the CliCrop model which provides growing stages and water requirements to the crop YFM .
