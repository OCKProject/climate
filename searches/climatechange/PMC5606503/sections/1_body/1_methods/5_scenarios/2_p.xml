For each emission scenario, the IGSM‐CAM is run with three different values of climate sensitivity (CS = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.5°C), which are obtained by changing the strength of the cloud feedback in the climate model using a radiative cloud adjustment method (see

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>]. For each set of emissions scenarios and climate sensitivity, a five‐member ensemble is created with a different representation of natural variability through initial condition perturbation. More details on the design of the climate ensemble and the analysis of the projections of temperature and precipitation changes over the U.S. can be found in

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>] shows that the range of agro‐climate projections from the IGSM‐CAM ensemble is similar to that of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble. That is because the IGSM‐CAM ensemble samples key sources of uncertainty, namely emissions levels, the global climate response (using different values of climate sensitivity) and the natural variability. In this study, we mainly focus on simulations with a climate sensitivity of 3.0°C (CS3.0) to identify the benefits of GHG mitigation. We present results from the five‐member ensemble mean to filter out noise associated with natural variability and thus extract the anthropogenic signal. While five initial conditions might not be enough to fully filter out natural variability, it is an improvement over current modeling studies and practices, which generally do not run with multiple initial conditions and thus do not filter out the role of natural variability. We further identify the range of projections associated with the uncertainty in natural variability to determine its contribution in our analysis. We also provide a brief analysis of the impact of the uncertainty in climate sensitivity for the unconstrained emissions scenario.
