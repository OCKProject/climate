<p class="p">A set of major assumptions are made in the modeling framework regarding: (1) Conveyance and field efficiencies: they are assumed to remain constant over time to be consistent with our objective of estimating the effect of climate change without adaptation in the irrigation sector; (2) Groundwater resources: they are estimated to remain constant at 2005 levels unless groundwater extraction is greater than groundwater recharge; (3) the allocation of irrigation water to the various crop considered: we assume that all crops are affected equally by a shortage of water for irrigation, i.e., no specific crop has priority access to water over another crop; and (4) irrigated areas: we assume that they remain fixed at current levels with the explicit aim to estimate the effect of climate change on irrigated crops under actual cropping conditions (i.e., without adaptation) and identify the areas most vulnerable to irrigation shortages in the future.</p>
