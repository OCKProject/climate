 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>]. U.S. national‚Äêlevel economic projections from EPPA are used to provide boundary conditions to the U.S. Regional Energy Policy (USREP) model [

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>], a general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with subnational detail. USREP's projections of economic activity in different regions of the U.S. are then used to determine water requirements, as detailed below. The USREP model is also coupled with the National Renewable Energy Lab Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model [
