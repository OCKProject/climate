<p class="p">The water resources considered in WRS‐US are composed of runoff (estimated using the IGSM‐CAM) and groundwater resources (see

 <xref rid="eft2229-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>] for more details). Anthropogenic water requirements are estimated for five sectors: irrigation, thermoelectric cooling (estimated directly by the ReEDS model), public supply (drinking water and other domestic uses by public utilities), self‐supply (mostly industrial) and the mining sector. Changes in requirements from the last three sectors are estimated as a function of population and gross domestic product per capita projections from USREP. Water withdrawals for irrigation are estimated with the CliCrop model [

Environmental water requirements are representative of policies protecting water ecosystems through the regulation of water levels and flows. See
