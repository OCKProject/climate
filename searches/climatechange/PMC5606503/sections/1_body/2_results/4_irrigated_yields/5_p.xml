<p class="p">When considering all U.S. basins, GHG mitigation is beneficial for all crop yields (see right panel of Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0013" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>). The reduction in water stress associated with GHG mitigation under both policies far offsets the negative impact from reduced CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations compared to the reference scenario (e.g., less CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect). Under the CS3.0 POL4.5 scenario, crop yield factors are expected to be higher than under the no‐policy scenario, CS3.0 REF. Under the most stringent policy, CS3.0 POL3.7, the increases in crop yield factors for all crops (except soybean) are expected to be even larger than under the CS3.0 POL4.5 scenario. For cotton, both mitigation policies effectively address the detrimental effect of water scarcity for irrigation. For forage, only the harshest mitigation policy is effective at reducing the effect of water stress on irrigated yields compared to the present. Overall, these results show that, in the absence of adaptation, mitigation policies help lessen the effect of water stress on irrigated yields due to climate change, that is, irrigated crops will on average either experience larger growth or smaller decreases in yields compared to a no‐policy scenario. However, those results are averaged over the simulations with different initial conditions, and individual simulations can show large variations in these effects.
