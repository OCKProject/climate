<p class="p">Over the United States as a whole, the average crop yield factors in the reference scenario (CS3.0 REF) are expected to increase slightly for four out of six crops by mid‐century compared to the present (on average across simulations with different representations of natural variability; see left side panel of Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0013" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>). Climate and socioeconomic changes are therefore expected to reduce the effect of water stress on irrigated yields for all crops, except forage and cotton (for which the basin with the largest irrigated area is also the most water stressed), which are projected to be negatively impacted. In absolute terms, the largest decrease in crop yield factor is expected for forage (from 0.84 to 0.78), and represents a loss of 6 percentage points. On the one hand, crops benefit from increases in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, but on the other hand, this effect can be offset by the impact of water stress. Our results thus suggest that the impact of water stress is stronger (or the effect of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is weaker) for forage and cotton than for the other four crops.
