<p class="p">Yield reductions for some crops caused by a lack of irrigation are estimated to be very severe in some basins (see Figures

 <xref rid="eft2229-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for the geo‐localization of basins) are only 40% of optimal irrigated yields due to water scarcity. By 2050 and under the CS3.0 REF scenario, future irrigated maize yields in this basin are on average expected to decrease to only 10% of the optimal irrigated yields because of an increase in water deficits. This means that the lack of water results in a yield loss of 90% relative to a perfectly irrigated situation. However, maize is only marginally cultivated in this basin, thus this result has little implications for total U.S. irrigated maize production. For the Niobrara‐Platte‐Loup and Kansas basins, covering most of Nebraska and the northern part of Kansas, where irrigated maize areas are the largest, irrigated yields are expected to increase and represent more than 90% and 70% of the potential irrigated yields, respectively. For cotton, however, the Gila basin of Southern Arizona—which has large irrigated areas and is already severely affected by water scarcity for irrigation in the present period—is expected to be further affected, with a crop yield dropping to less than 10% of the optimal irrigated yield by mid‐century under the CS3.0 REF scenario. Irrigated areas of forage are widely spread across the United States with a higher concentration in the North West where basins in the Great Basin region are projected to be greatly impacted by water shortages. Irrigated sorghum and soybean are located mainly in the Southern Plains where moderate effects of water stress are projected. Similar projections are made for wheat, which is also irrigated in the Southern Plains, but also in the Pacific North West, where water stress is also expected to be relatively mild.
