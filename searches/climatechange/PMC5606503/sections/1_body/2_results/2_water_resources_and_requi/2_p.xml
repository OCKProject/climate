<p class="p">To determine future water allocation across sectors and subsequent stress, the WRS‐US model projects future water resources and uses. The ensemble‐mean total runoff is projected to increase on average for all emissions scenarios (see Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> for a box plot of projected changes in total natural runoff by mid‐century, not including inflows from upstream basins, for each emissions scenario). Some individual simulations, however, project a decrease (see Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). There is thus evidence of a large role for natural variability to affect precipitation trends, especially by mid‐century, a finding in agreement with the analysis of
