<p class="p">Water requirements for the thermoelectric cooling, public supply, self‐supply and mining sectors are projected to increase by between 135% and 140% driven by a steady increase in population and economic activity (see Figure S3). Irrigation water requirements are projected to decrease by between 6% and 24% in total over the U.S. (see Figure S3), thanks to changes in the evaporative demand and crop water use efficiency that result from increases in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations and climate change (i.e., increases in precipitation). In the Western part of the Unite States, where irrigation water demand is the largest, the projected decreases are smaller and in the 1% to 13% range (see Figure S4). Combining climate‐driven and socioeconomic‐driven changes, as shown in the right panel of Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, results in a projected increase in total United States water requirements under all emissions scenarios. Once again, the magnitude of the projected changes varies strongly from simulation to simulation, highlighting the large uncertainty in climate change projections, especially the role of natural climate variability.
