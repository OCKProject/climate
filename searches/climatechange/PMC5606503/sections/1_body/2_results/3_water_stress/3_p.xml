<p class="p">Emissions abatement scenarios provide some relief for most basins relative to the reference scenario, including in the Mountain area (reflected as positive values in the lower graphs of the Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and in California's central valley under the most stringent policy (CS3.0 POL3.7). In some basins in the Central Plains, for example, Arkansas‐Cimarron, where higher increases in precipitation are predicted than in the reference scenario, mitigation policies have the opposite effect. Note that the results presented in these maps are averaged across representation of natural variability for each scenario so that the anthropogenic signal can be extracted from the noise of internal climate variability.
