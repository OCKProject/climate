<p class="p">The distribution of changes in irrigation water stress relative to the present (see Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2229-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) differs between representations of natural variability for each scenario. However, in each case the modal basin has a relatively modest negative impact (i.e., an SSR for irrigation smaller than—but close to—zero). The graph does reveal a relatively long left‐tail in impacts: a small number of basins are much more severely affected than average. This varies across scenarios and the overall distributions are flatter and more skewed to the left for the reference and intermediate mitigation scenario (CS3.0 POL4.5) than for the CS3.0 POL3.7 scenario in which a smaller number of river basins are expected to experience large changes in irrigation availability. These results highlight the need for a very stringent mitigation policy to substantially change the distribution of impacts on irrigation water stress.
