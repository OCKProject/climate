<p class="p">While our modeling framework allows us to track the impact of climate change and socioeconomic stressors on irrigated crop yields, we choose to keep irrigated areas fixed. We project changes in crop production that will be caused by climate stress and increases in water demand by other sectors such as energy production and municipal use, but in the absence of adaptation in the agricultural sector. This allows us to identify regions where we can expect future transitions in irrigated agriculture, either to rainfed crops or where agricultural production will decrease or disappear.</p>
