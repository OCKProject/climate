<p class="p">We developed, piloted, and revised semi-structured interview guides for each category of participants (see Appendix Information for interview guides). We conducted 113 interviews of one to one and a half hours in-person or via telephone from May through September 2013. Participants were mainly from California, with a smaller sample of national public health leaders engaged in climate change. We asked interviewees about their knowledge, attitudes, and activities regarding climate change and health, strategies to address climate change, and challenges to and opportunities for greater engagement in work at that nexus. For the public health interviewees, our final determination of participant category was based on whether they articulated their work as connected to climate change without prompting during the interview.
