<p class="p">Yet public health engagement on climate change has been limited in light of the severity of the risks of climate change, and the magnitude of the opportunities climate change solutions present for health. One assessment of local agencies found that the gap between the demand for health and climate interventions and the resources available to health departments was greater than in any other sector [

To understand why these barriers persist and identify ways to promote engagement, we sought to understand the differences between public health practitioners currently working on climate change and those who are not. We also sought to understand the perspective of those working on climate change in other sectors on the potential for strengthening inter-sectoral collaboration (for this paper, inter-sectoral collaboration refers to the coordinated efforts of two or more sectors within government to improve outcomes, including working horizontally and vertically across different levels of government (local, regional, state, federal) [
