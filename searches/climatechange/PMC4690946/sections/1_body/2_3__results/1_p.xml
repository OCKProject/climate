<p class="p">We present results of two main areas of analysis: Barriers to effective public health engagement, and opportunities for advancing work at the nexus of climate change and public health. Some barriers operate at a conceptual individual-level, while others operate within the institution of public health or are structural (operating across multiple interconnected systems and sectors). We first present the findings on barriers from the two categories of public health interviewees (“PH-engaged” and “PH non-engaged”), and the “Non-PH” perceived barriers at the end. Opportunities to shift public health practice towards stronger engagement on climate change issues include integrating climate change into current public health practice; providing support for climate solutions with health co-benefits; communicating potential health and health equity impacts of climate change and climate actions; and engaging and mobilizing impacted communities and public health professionals.</p>
