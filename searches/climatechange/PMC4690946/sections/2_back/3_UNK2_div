   <title class="title">A1. Introduction</title>
   <p class="p">Thank you for agreeing to meet with me/us. We are working with the Public Health Institute Center for Public Health and Climate Change on a project funded by the Kresge Foundation. We see climate change as one of the greatest health and equity challenges of the 21st century, and we also see that many climate action strategies could have very positive impacts on health. The goal of this project is to find out how to make it easier for the public health community to work on climate change and strengthen partnerships between public health workers and others who are working on climate change. We also want to know how public health could help others working on climate change to bring a stronger health frame to their work. We are starting by speaking to people in public health, climate change, equity, planning, environmental justice, and other fields, to learn more about their work and get their ideas on what would be helpful.</p>
   <p class="p">Everything you tell me will be kept strictly confidential, unless we specifically ask for your permission to quote you. I‘ll be taking notes, but only my co-investigator and I will have access to them. You should feel free at any time to ask me questions concerning the interview or the project, or to decline to answer a question. Do you have any questions? OK, let’s get started.</p>
   <p class="p">It will help to define what we mean by public health and climate change up front.</p>
   <p class="p">We’re defining “public health” broadly to include the “upstream” or social, environmental and physical determinants of health, such as asthma from air pollution, housing conditions, education, income, access to healthy foods and transportation, 
    <italic class="italic">etc</italic>. When we talk about “public health workers” or “public health organizations”, we are talking about people both inside and outside of government that are working on any aspect of trying to improve population and community health.
   </p>
   <p class="p">When we talk about the impacts of climate change on health, we’re talking about both direct impacts like extreme heat, indirect impacts like rising food prices from drought, and the health effects of various strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as decreased air pollution from higher fuel efficiency. Also, this project is focused more on the US than on international issues, even though we understand that the global impacts are very significant.</p>

   <title class="title">A2. Public Health Involvement and Role</title>
   <p class="p">First, can you tell me a little about the work you do, especially work which you think relates directly or indirectly to climate change or co-benefits?</p>
   <p class="p">* You’ve talked about climate change and its links to (public health topic areas they mentioned). Are there other areas where you see key connections between climate change and public health, for example like emergency preparedness, vector-borne diseases, chronic diseases, and how do you see those links? 
    <list list-type="bullet" class="list">

      <p class="p" xmlns="">What about areas like maternal and child health, infectious diseases, or reproductive health?</p>
     </div>
    </list>
   </p>
   <p class="p">What are your thoughts about the role of public health and public health workers in climate change—what should the public health community—inside and outside of government public health agencies—be doing about climate change? If you had lots of resources, in an ideal world, what would public health be doing around climate change?</p>
   <p class="p">Do you think that we should be striving to get everyone in public health engaged in climate change, or do you think we should focus on building expertise in a smaller more focused group of public health workers, or both? Do you have any thoughts about reaching out to workers engaged in direct service – like public health nurses, or restaurant inspectors or WIC workers about climate change, and whether they could or should have a role in climate change work?</p>

  <sec class="sec" xmlns="">
   <title class="title">A3. Framing</title>

   <p class="p">We are going to ask you questions about climate change, but we know that it is not an issue that many people in public health know all that much about. So please don’t worry about whether or not your answers are “right”—for many of the questions there are no “right” answers. We are asking them so that we have a better understanding about where we should start when, later in our project, we develop some materials about climate change specifically for public health workers.</p>
   <p class="p">Everything you tell me will be kept confidential, unless we specifically ask for your permission to quote you. I’ll be taking notes, but only my co-investigator and I will have access to them. We will not quote you without asking specific permission.</p>

   <title class="title">C1. Introduction</title>
   <p class="p">Thank you for agreeing to meet with me/us. We are working with the Public Health Institute Center for Public Health and Climate Change on a project funded by the Kresge Foundation. We see climate change as one of the greatest health and equity challenges of the 21st century, and we also see that many climate action strategies could have very positive impacts on health. The goal of this project is to find out how to make it easier for the public health community to work on climate change and strengthen partnerships between public health workers and others who are working on climate change. We also want to know how public health could help others working on climate change to bring a stronger health frame to their work. We are starting by speaking to people in public health, climate change, equity, planning, environmental justice, and other fields, to learn more about their work and get their ideas on what would be helpful.</p>
   <p class="p">Everything you tell me will be kept confidential, unless we specifically ask for your permission to quote you. I‘ll be taking notes, but only my co-investigator and I will have access to them. You should feel free at any time to ask me questions concerning the interview or the project, or to decline to answer a question. Do you have any questions? OK, let’s get started.</p>
   <p class="p">It will help to define what we mean by public health and climate change up front.</p>
   <p class="p">We’re defining “public health” broadly to include the “upstream” or social, environmental and physical determinants of health, such as asthma from air pollution, housing conditions, education, income, access to healthy foods and transportation, 
    <italic class="italic">etc</italic>. When we talk about “public health workers” or “public health organizations”, we are talking about people both inside and outside of government that are working on any aspect of trying to improve population and community health.
   </p>
   <p class="p">When we talk about the impacts of climate change on health, we’re talking about both direct impacts like extreme heat, indirect impacts like rising food prices from drought, and the health effects of various strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as decreased air pollution from higher fuel efficiency. Also, this project is focused more on the US than on international issues, even though we understand that the global impacts are very significant.</p>

   <title class="title">C2. Relationship between Their Work and Public Health</title>
   <p class="p">First, can you tell me a little about the work you do and your organization does, especially that relates to climate change? 
    <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
     <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

     </div>
    </list>
   </p>
   <p class="p">Can you talk about how you see the links between climate and health and equity, either in terms of the impacts of climate change itself, or how climate mitigation and adaptation strategies might affect health or equity? Are you familiar with the concept of co-benefits? Co-benefits are strategies to prevent further climatic changes that also have a beneficial effect on health and quality of life.</p>

   <p class="p">Do you have any thoughts about how the community or other stakeholders that you work with think about climate change? Do you have any stories or examples that show their awareness or concern?</p>
   <p class="p">How about how they view health? Do you have any stories or examples that show their awareness or concern?</p>
   <p class="p">Do you have any stories or examples of whether they are aware or concerned about the impacts of climate change on health?</p>
   <p class="p">In your experience, what are some of the challenges in talking to people in your community about climate change? Do you talk explicitly about climate change, or do you start from some different framing? If so, what/how? Do you ever/often talk about the links between climate change and health? Explore.</p>
   <p class="p">Why do you think the general public is not more concerned about climate change?</p>
   <p class="p">Do you see opportunities for getting people more engaged in climate change action and strategies through the use of a health frame? Are there any ways that using a health frame might either help or hinder your own efforts around climate change, or things we should be careful about as we try to engage more people in climate change using a health frame?</p>
