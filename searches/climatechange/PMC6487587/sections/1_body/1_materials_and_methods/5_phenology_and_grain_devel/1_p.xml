<p class="p">Phyllochron (
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic>), daylength response (
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic>) and duration of grain filling (
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic>) are directly related to phenological development of wheat. 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic> is the thermal time required for the appearance of successive leaves, and is a major driver of phenological development. 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic> together determine the rate of crop development and the date of flowering and maturity. 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic> is defined as a cultivar-specific amount of thermal time that needs to be accumulated to complete grain filling. During grain filling, assimilates for the grain are available from two sources viz. (i) new biomass produced from intercepted radiation after anthesis, and (ii) water-soluble or labile carbohydrates stored mostly in the stem before anthesis.
