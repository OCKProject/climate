<p class="p">In the present study, a crop ideotype was defined as a set of cultivar parameters that would deliver optimal yield performance in a target environment. The ideotype will produce maximum possible yield when developed as a cultivar. A wheat ideotype was characterized by eight cultivar parameters, controlling crop growth, development, and responses to drought stresses, which are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and described in the section ‘Target traits for improvement under future climate change’. We designed a drought-sensitive (DS) and a drought-tolerant (DT) ideotype for each site separately (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The DS ideotype is sensitive to drought stress during reproductive development, in which grain number could be reduced depending on the severity of drought stress. In contrast, a DT ideotype is tolerant, or insensitive to any such drought stress during reproductive development. A total of eight cultivar parameters were optimized during the ideotype design, where initial cultivar parameters were the same for both DS and DT ideotypes at a given site (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
