The soil profile was filled with the maximum available water capacity at sowing. An increase of 10% in RUE was assumed for wheat by 2050 (

All simulations were assumed to be water-limited, but no N limitation was considered. Additionally, the effects of an adverse weather event of heat stress around flowering on grain number and size (
