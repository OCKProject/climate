<p class="p">Soil is described as a cascade of 5-cm layers up to a user-defined depth. Roots continue to grow until reaching a soil-dependent maximum depth or until anthesis, whichever occurs first. Each soil layer contains root-available (water potential &lt;−1.5 MPa) and -unavailable (water potential &gt;−1.5 MPa) water, depending on its water retention characteristics. Only a proportion of available soil water can be extracted by plants from each layer of the root zone on any day depending on efficiency of water extraction (λ) and rate of root water uptake (
