<p class="p">Water limitation adversely affects both source (carbohydrate production) and sink strength (grain filling) in the plant. Photosynthesis and biomass production are reduced by water limitation. New biomass production decreases proportionally to the response of photosynthesis to water stress (

Earlier leaf senescence will reduce grain yield by reducing grain size due not only to reduction in intercepted radiation and photosynthesis, but also to reduction in translocation of the labile plant reserve carbohydrate to the grain due to premature termination of grain filling driven by early leaf senescence.
