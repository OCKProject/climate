<p class="p">For the present study, 13 sites across Europe were selected, representing the major and contrasting wheat growing regions in Europe, from Spain in the south to Denmark in the north, and Hungary in the east to the UK in the west (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the detailed site characteristics, typical locally cultivated wheat varieties, and the sowing dates. Out of six wheat cultivars, Cartaya and Creso are spring wheat, whereas the others are winter wheat cultivars. The future climate in 2050 was based on a global climate model (GCM), HadGEM2, from the CMIP5 ensemble (
