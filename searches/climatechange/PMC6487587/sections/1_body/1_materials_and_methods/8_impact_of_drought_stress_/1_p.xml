<p class="p">A simple mechanism was implemented in the current version of Sirius to account for the effect of drought stress on grain number during reproductive development by using a drought stress factor (DSF). The DSF was calculated as a ratio of actual transpiration (

 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) to potential transpiration (

 <sub class="sub">p</sub>) during reproductive development. However, linking different reproductive development stages (floral formation and development, meiosis and gametogenesis, fertilization, etc.) to corresponding plant growth stages for modelling is difficult as they often happen within a short period and vary depending on the climatic conditions and abiotic stresses. For example, meiosis in wheat often coincides with booting stage, but meiosis within a single floret can last only for 1–2 d, whereas meiosis within an ear and plant could be extended by 3–5 d (
