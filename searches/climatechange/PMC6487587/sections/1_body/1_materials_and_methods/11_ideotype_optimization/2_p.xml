<p class="p">In an additional set of simulations, we relaxed the criteria of yield variance during the optimization process, excluding ideotypes with CV exceeding 15% from the selection process. The purpose of increasing CV was to evaluate the effect of increased yield variance during optimization on the performance of ideotypes.</p>
