<p class="p">Photosynthesis and biomass production are calculated on a daily basis as the product of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and radiation use efficiency (RUE), limited by temperature and water stress. Radiation interception is related to leaf area index (LAI) via the Lambertâ€“Beer law, with a default extinction coefficient of 0.45. In Sirius, RUE is proportional to atmospheric CO
