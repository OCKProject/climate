<p class="p">Canopy development is described as a series of leaf layers associated with individual mainstem leaves. Leaf area development in each layer is simulated by a thermal time submodel, and actual leaf area is calculated using a simple limitation rule. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf numbers, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalization. Maximum area of flag leaf (

The duration of leaf senescence is expressed in thermal time and linked to the rank of the leaf in the canopy. Total canopy senescence synchronizes with the end of grain filling. Leaf senescence could be accelerated by shortage of N to sustain green leaves and grain filling, or by abiotic stress, viz. temperature or water stress. One of the strategies to increase grain yield is to extend the duration of leaf senescence and maintain green leaf area longer after anthesis, termed ‘stay green’ (
