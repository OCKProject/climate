<p class="p">Developing wheat cultivars tolerant to drought stress during reproductive development is currently a big challenge for wheat breeders (

 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Serba and Yadav, 2016</xref>). Breeding of drought-tolerant wheat cultivars suffers from complex multi-trait and polygenic control of drought tolerance, high genotype and environment (GÃ—E) interactions, low heritability, and difficulty in mass screening of plant traits and genes (

 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hu and Xiong, 2014</xref>). Experimental analysis of potential yield benefits of drought tolerance during reproductive development under future climate change and identification of the target traits for improvement are difficult due to the complexity in designing such experiments in the real world for climates that can only be predicted with a high degree of uncertainty.
