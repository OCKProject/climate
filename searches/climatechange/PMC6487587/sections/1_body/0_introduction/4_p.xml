 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donald (1968)</xref> proposed an alternative breeding approach, ‘breeding of crop ideotypes’, in which breeders select plant ideotypes based on knowledge of crop physiology for improvement of plant traits under the target environment and then breed for them, rather than breeding for ‘defect elimination’ and ‘selection for yield’. A crop ideotype is a virtual idealized crop, or a crop model, which is expected to produce a greater quality and quantity of grain when developed as a cultivar. Process-based ecophysiological crop models are the most powerful tools that help to (i) deconvolute a complex trait, such as drought tolerance, into a list of simpler component traits suitable for further analyses and linking with phenotype and genotype, and then breeding; (ii) evaluate the performance of different plant traits under future climatic conditions and thus assist in discovering and prioritizing target traits for improvement; (iii) search optimal combinations and trade-offs between target traits; (iv) design ideotypes optimized for target environments and guide plant breeders towards the most relevant targets (

Sirius was calibrated and validated for different modern wheat varieties, and performed well under diverse climatic conditions across Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand, including free-air CO

Although a few studies have projected the effects of common water limitation and drought stresses on wheat yield potentials under future climate change in Europe, the quantitative effects of reproductive stage drought stress on grain number and subsequently on grain yield have not been considered before (

A few experimental studies have reported the performance of reproductive stage drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive wheat germplasms under current climate, but quantitative potential yield benefits from drought tolerance during reproductive development under future climatic conditions are mostly unknown (
