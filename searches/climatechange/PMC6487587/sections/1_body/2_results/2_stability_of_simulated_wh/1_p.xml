<p class="p">Averaged over sites, mean yield variance (CV) over 100 years’ simulations was 0.05 (CV=0.04–0.06) and 0.09 (CV=0.05–0.10) for DT and DS ideotypes, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The result indicates 44% smaller yield variance for DT compared with the DS ideotype. Among individual sites, four out of 13 sites had almost equal yield variance (CV~0.05) for both the ideotypes, viz. TU, VI, RR, and WA. In the rest of the sites, CV of wheat yield potential for DT was 50% smaller compared with DS.
