<p class="p">The highest differences in the optimized parameter values between ideotypes were found for 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic> (33%), 
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic> (63%), 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic>, (26%), 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> (156%), 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic> (982%), and 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic> (226%) at SL, LL, KA, and TR (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For all these parameters, optimized values were greater for DT compared with DS, except for 
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic>, where both the values were greater for DS compared with DT. An overall minimum or almost no difference in these parameter values between ideotypes was found at WA, RR, VI, and TU. An intermediate ideotype effect was obtained for the same parameters at the rest of the sites, with greater improved values for DT compared with DS. There were no ideotype and site effects for the other two parameters, viz. 
 <italic class="italic">Wsa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Wss</italic>, where almost constant model optimization effects were obtained (80% for 
 <italic class="italic">Wsa</italic> and ~4% for 
 <italic class="italic">Wss</italic>).
