<p class="p">Averaged over the sites and ideotypes, optimized values for 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic> were found to be increased from their initial values by 29, 36, 87, and 122%, in which optimized values were 10, 8, 54, and 87% greater, respectively for the DT ideotype compared with DS (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, the optimized value of 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic> increased by 95% compared with its initial value, but optimized values were 54% greater for the DS ideotype compared with DT. An equally high optimized 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic> value (~7%) was obtained at almost all the sites for the DS ideotype. Optimized values of the rest of the three parameters, viz
 <italic class="italic">. Pp</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Wsa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Wss</italic>, decreased by 83, 80, and 4%, respectively, where no difference (â‰¤2%) was found between ideotypes, except for 
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic>. Similar to the simulated wheat yields, strong site effects were found on the optimized parameter values and between ideotypes in an individual site.
