<p class="p">When the site-specific performance of individual wheat ideotypes was compared, the highest yields (17–18 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were achieved for the DT ideotype at WA, RR, TR, CF, TU, and MO, whereas lowest yields (~14 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were obtained at SL and KA. Intermediate yields of 15–16 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were found at the rest of the sites. On the other hand, maximum yields (16–18 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) for DS were obtained at WA, RR, TU, and CF, whereas minimum yield was found at SL (~10 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), followed by KA and LL (~12 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). A medium wheat yield of around 13–15 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was observed at other sites. When the site-specific performance of DT was compared with DS, simulated wheat yields of DT were 28–37% greater compared with DS at SL, LL, and TR, with the highest potential yield benefit of 37% for DT at SL. In contrast, a similar magnitude of wheat yield was obtained for both DT and DS ideotypes in the range 15–18 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at WA, RR, VI, and TU, where the difference in yield potentials between two ideotypes was ≤1%. The mean wheat yield of DT was 10–23% greater compared with DS at the other six sites.
