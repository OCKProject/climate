<p class="p">The upper two panels in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> show simulated wheat yield and yield variance (coefficient of variation; CV) for DT and DS ideotypes under the future climate change in 2050 at 13 sites across major wheat growing regions in Europe, when yield CV was limited to 10% during model optimization. Averaged over the sites, the DT ideotype achieved 13% higher mean yield (16.1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) compared with DS (14.2 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Averaged over both ideotypes, the highest wheat yield was found at WA (17.9 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), followed by RR, CF, and TU, whereas the lowest yield was observed at SL (12.0 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), followed by KA. All the other sites had a yield in the range of 14–16 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. However, there were strong site effects on ideotype performances at individual sites.
