<p class="p">The lower two panels in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> show simulated wheat yields and yield CV for DT and DS ideotypes across 13 European sites when yield CV over 100 years was limited to 15% during model optimization. When yield CV was increased from 10% to 15% during the optimization process, no effect was found on the results (yields and CV) for the DT ideotype across different sites as reported above. Averaged over the sites, the minimum and mean wheat yields of DS increased by 11 and 7%, respectively, whereas maximum yield did not increase either at individual sites or averaged over different sites. At the same time, the maximum and mean CV of wheat yield for the DS ideotype increased by 50 and 18%, respectively.
