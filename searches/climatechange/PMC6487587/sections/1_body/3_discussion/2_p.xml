<p class="p">Another reason for higher yield potential of the DT ideotype compared with DS could be overall better optimized cultivar parameters contributing to a greater source and sink capacity under drought stress, and a direct and indirect contribution to drought tolerance. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> were greater in the DT ideotype compared with DS. A high 
 <italic class="italic">SG</italic> value implies delaying leaf senescence and greater plant capacity to maintain more active photosynthetic tissues longer under water stress during anthesis and grain filling, and is thus considered one of the most important traits for drought tolerance (

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Luche 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). An extended grain filling period (a high 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic> value) increases grain yield by increasing light interception for more photosynthesis and production of more carbohydrate to be translocated directly to the developing grains. It also increases the possibility of completion of re-translocation of labile carbohydrate reserves to the grains (

 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov and Stratonovitch, 2013</xref>). Duration of the grain filling period is an important trait to improve through breeding for increasing wheat yield potentials under future climate change (

 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Greater 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> increases the potential LAI, which in turn increases light interception, photosynthesis, carbohydrate production, and finally grain yield (
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov and Stratonovitch, 2013</xref>). Increasing both leaf area and grain filling period could increase yield potential further under future climatic conditions for drought-tolerant wheat cultivars. However, greater leaf area and longer grain filling period could conflict with drought avoidance for drought-sensitive cultivars. Our results of relatively smaller increase in optimized values of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic> for DS show that increasing 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic> is a trade-off between avoiding drought by reducing transpiration and achieving higher yield potential for the DS ideotype. 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic> was smaller in the DS ideotype compared with DT, indicating a relatively higher chance for DS to escape any terminal drought by early flowering and maturity due to the shorter vegetative stage. Early flowering and maturity are important drought escape traits for many crops including wheat (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Greater 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic> values for DS compared with DT indicate that drought-sensitive cultivars could take up soil water faster to avoid current drought stress. But, faster water uptake could be risky for DS to complete the life cycle successfully under severe drought at the end of the growing season. On the other hand, drought-tolerant cultivars would take up soil water slower in favour of successful completion of the life cycle with a likely terminal drought. Drought stress generally reduces crop yield through decreased photosynthesis and increased leaf senescence (

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fahad

 </xref>). Decreased response of photosynthesis to water stress (
 <italic class="italic">Wsa</italic>) and reduced maximum acceleration of leaf senescence (

 <italic class="italic">Wss</italic>, but the respective values were almost equal across sites and ideotypes.
