However, introduction of a relatively simple description in Sirius for a reduction in grain number due to drought stress during reproductive development was found to be effective for quantitative evaluation of the potential yield benefits from drought tolerance in wheat under future climatic conditions. We conclude that drought tolerance during reproductive development is important for high yield potentials with high yield stability of wheat under future climate change in most of the wheat growing regions in Europe, with predicted maximum potential yield benefits of 28–37% in southern Europe and 10–23% in central and eastern Europe. Introduction of drought tolerance during reproductive development, along with improvements in cultivar parameters linked with increased yield and drought tolerance directly or indirectly, is the key to achieving higher wheat yield potentials along with higher yield stability under future climatic conditions in Europe. Our results identified the important cultivar parameters and their optimal combination for future improvement to achieve high yield potentials under climate change in Europe, viz. grain filling duration, phyllochron, leaf area, stay green, rate of root water uptake, photosynthetic response to water stress, and maximum acceleration of leaf senescence due to water stress.
