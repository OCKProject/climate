<p class="p">Overall, higher yield potential of the DT compared with the DS ideotype under future climatic condition could be linked to a greater number of grains for the DT ideotype. The number of fertile grains setting during reproductive development was reduced by drought stress for the DS ideotype, depending on the level of drought stress at different sites, whereas the primary grain setting number remained unaffected for DT due to drought tolerance during reproductive development. Reduction in grain number decreased the total sink capacity resulting in reduced yield potentials for DS. Adverse effects of drought stress on the primary grain setting number during reproductive development have been reported by different experimental studies for common wheat germplasms/lines/cultivars (

These studies also found some wheat germplasms tolerant to drought stress during reproductive development, indicating the possibility of improvement in drought tolerance through genetical adaptation. Our study shows that drought tolerance during reproductive development is an important trait for achieving high wheat yield potential under future climate change in Europe.
