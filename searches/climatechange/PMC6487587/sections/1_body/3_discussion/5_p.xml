<p class="p">Another important finding of the present study was that drought-tolerant wheat ideotypes would have greater yield stability under future climatic conditions, whereas yield stability of drought-sensitive ideotypes would be substantially lower. These results were further supported by the fact that the yield potentials of the DT ideotype were not affected across different sites even when the selection criteria of yield variance (CV) was increased to 15% during the optimization process. On the other hand, mean yield potential of the DS ideotype increased (7%) at the cost of reducing yield stability (18%) further. This indicates that there would be a trade-off between yield potential and yield stability for drought-sensitive wheat cultivars.</p>
