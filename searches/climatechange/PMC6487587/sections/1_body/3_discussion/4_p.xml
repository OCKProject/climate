<p class="p">The highest yield benefits (28–37%) due to drought tolerance were obtained mainly in southern Europe (e.g. SL and LL). This result could be explained by the high probability of drought stress during reproductive development under future climate change, and the highest differences in the optimized parameter values (e.g.

 <italic class="italic">Gf</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ph</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pp</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ru</italic>) between the ideotypes at those sites. Similarly, a medium yield benefit of 10–23% for DT in most of the central and eastern European sites (e.g. MO, SR, DC, and HA) could be due to a most likely medium drought stress during reproductive development under future climatic conditions and an intermediate difference in optimized parameter values in favour of the DT ideotype. In contrast, a minimum or no yield benefit for DT compared with DS was found only at a few sites in north-western and central-western Europe (e.g. RR, WA, and TU), characterized with a low probability of, or no, severe drought stress during reproductive development under future climate change. In these sites, almost equal optimized cultivar values were obtained for both the DT and DS ideotypes. This is in accordance with the minimum or no difference in wheat yield potentials due to ideotypes at those sites. It is worthy of note that we found the highest yield benefits (28–37%) due to drought tolerance at one additional site, TR (Denmark), but it was characterized by a good annual precipitation (721 mm year

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the adverse impact of drought stress on yield potential during reproductive development could happen locally at some sites even with good annual precipitation, for example in Denmark. Drought stress during reproductive development is a dynamic, but a short-term, event (~10–15 d), which depends on many abiotic and biotic factors at that time. Thus, a drought-tolerant wheat cultivar would be important for high yield potential under climate change even in northern Europe (e.g. Denmark). The results for the DS ideotype on decreased wheat yield potentials under future climate change in most of the European sites are in line with
