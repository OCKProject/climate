  <p class="p">Wheat yield and yield coefficient of variance (CV) of drought-sensitive (DS) and drought-tolerant (DT) ideotypes optimized under the future 2050 climate scenario (based on HadGEM2 and RCP8.5) at 13 sites, representing major wheat growing regions in Europe. The yield CV during model optimization was limited to 10% (A) and 15% (B). (This figure is available in colour at
