<p class="p">Large spatial-scale events of drought-induced tree mortality have been registered in Europe and North America (Anderegg et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Tree death is generally preceded by a severe decline of the growth and the dieback of a large part of the crown (Sánchez-Salguero et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Dobbertin and Brang (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) probed that the adoption of “defoliation” improves models to predict the mortality of trees in national forest inventories. Substantial reduction of foliar mass is assumed reflect the loss of photosynthates and compromises carbon allocation and tree growth (Garcia-Forner et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). According to Grote et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), big trees are especially subjected to water shortage and more likely to die than small trees, but Ruiz-Benito et al. (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and Van Gunst et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that in a “competitive” environment, as far as water resources are concerned, small trees are more likely to die.
