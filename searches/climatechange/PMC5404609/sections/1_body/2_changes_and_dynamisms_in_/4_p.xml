<p class="p">Tree diversity enhances growth and stabilizes productivity at stand level and on individual trees (Jucker et al.,

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), and it is supposed to modify the impacts of stress factors through “plant-to-plant” interactions. Such interactions may be either negative (competition) or positive (facilitation). According to the “stress gradient” hypothesis (He and Bertness, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), positive interactions are more frequent than negative ones in the poorest sites, where resources are scarce.
