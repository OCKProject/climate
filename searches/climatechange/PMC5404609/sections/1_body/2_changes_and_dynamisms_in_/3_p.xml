<p class="p">A different scenario suggests the persistence of the current tree species, but with changes in the forest structure (i.e., reduction of tree density) to withstand the reduction of water resources. The “local evolution,” or adaptation, of dominant tree species is promoted by the selection of more adapted individuals, that are those bearing the most suitable genotypes (Savolainen et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The local evolution of species as a result of climate change is achieved by taking advantage of the existing genetic variability in natural populations. Increasing interest is devoted to epigenetic acclimation processes (Barbeta et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and the so-called memory effect (Crisp et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which may be responsible for the progressive reduction of the negative effects of severe drought on tree physiology and survival (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
