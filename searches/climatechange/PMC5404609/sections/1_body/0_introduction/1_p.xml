<p class="p">Ecosystem services of forests are related to specific functions, such as growth, photosynthesis, regeneration, element cycling, soil formation, biodiversity holding, and so on. For this reason, a wide “bouquet” of attributes must be taken into consideration to evaluate the overall functionality of forests and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. These attributes may be considered “proxies” for specific relative ecosystem functions and services. The growth of trees and standing biomass is connected not only to the economic value of the forest (provisional services) but also to carbon sequestration and climate regulation (regulatory services). The overall canopy closure (i.e., leaf area index—LAI) can be considered a proxy for stand productivity (Gower et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) and stand transpiration (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), trees' capacity of uptake and filtration of air pollutants (Janhäll, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and element cycling (Burton et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1991</xref>) as well for soil conservation through the regulation of heavy rain impacts (Park and Cameron, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Parameters related to stand structure, species composition, and diversity may be considered indicative of the capacity of regeneration, to support game and wildlife and to host beneficial organisms against parasites. Some of these attributes are currently assessed in national forest inventories, and data can be useful to map the extension and level of related ecosystem services.
