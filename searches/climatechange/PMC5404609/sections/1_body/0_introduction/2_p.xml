<p class="p">The ecosystem functions and services of forests can be affected by the harshening of environmental conditions. Climate change impacts on forests is the result of complex interactions between meteorological factors and soil conditions (Barbeta et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), pathological agents (Wermelinger et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), forest fires (Flannigan et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>), and environmental pollution (De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The action of these co-occurring factors contributes to tree mortality and the reduction of canopy cover, as well-changes in stand composition and diversity (Millar and Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). These effects can be evaluated by comparing subsequent forest inventories; however, the long period of time elapsing between two successive surveys can make them scarcely applicable if our purposes are to detect and monitor in time and space the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem structure, functionalities and services provided.
