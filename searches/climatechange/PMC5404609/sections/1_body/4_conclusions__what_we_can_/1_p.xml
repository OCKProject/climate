<p class="p">To make the current terrestrial surveys able to capture the changes in forest ecosystems due to climate change, we need to shift the focus from the conditions of individual trees to the demography of the community. Mortality (including small trees, suckers, and understory woody vegetation) and regeneration are therefore key parameters to predict and interpret changes in tree species composition, local evolution, and possible desertification processes. Before tree death physiological stress conditions occur. These changes in plant health status, can be effectively assessed by foliar parameters, such as carbon isotope composition (that is proxy of drought stress, (Farquhar et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1982</xref>), and of carbon sequestration strategies of plants), chlorophyll fluorescence analysis, as indicator of overall plant stress conditions (Bussotti et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), and leaf morphology parameters (e.g., SLA, that indicates photosynthetic acclimation and vulnerability to stress, Bussotti, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Tree ring analysis, moreover, is highly desirable to explore tree growth responses in relation to resilience, mortality and foliage loss (Lloret et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). A first list of the actions needed to improve the informative potential of extensive monitoring surveys in forest ecosystems is provided in Table
