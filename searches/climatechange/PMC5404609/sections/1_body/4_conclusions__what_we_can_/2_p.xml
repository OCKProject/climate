 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; von Gadow et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and experimental plots (ecosystem manipulation, Perry and Troelstrup, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>) are relevant for the assessment and validation of the feasibility of the proxies to be extensively assessed and their ecological and physiological significance.
