<p class="p">The greatest usefulness of the extensive forest monitoring network in Europe is its very existence, as well as the existence of expert groups of scientists and technicians at national and European levels and a set of consolidated methods and manuals that make the assessed parameters (i.e., defoliation) reliable and generally accepted. What it needs is the introduction of concepts and indicators suitable for evaluating the mechanisms and processes performed by trees to withstand new environmental challenges owing to climate change. This integration of the current forest monitoring approach implies a substantial improvement of the diagnostic capacity of tree health indicators, combining the traditional visual assessment with more effective morphological and physiological indicators (Bussotti and Pollastrini,
