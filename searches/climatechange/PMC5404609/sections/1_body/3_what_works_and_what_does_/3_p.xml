<p class="p">The data series of ICP Forests (Level I, Timmermann et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), available from'90 in the past century, suggest a substantial stability (or slightly increasing defoliation) of crown conditions at the European level of some of the most diffuse tree species (
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris, Picea abies</italic> (L.) Karst., 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> L.), alongside a progressive worsening of crown conditions of Mediterranean species. Local events of mortality (Bussotti et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), with impact at the regional level, are scarcely captured in the current forest monitoring activities. Therefore, for management purposes, locally intensifying the network to capture the most critical tree species and/or ecological conditions may be useful. This result can be achieved by involving local communities, as well as appealing to the so-called citizen science (McKinley et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
