<p class="p">Changes in the health and physiological conditions of trees are assumed to provide insights for the prevision of changes in ecosystems and may represent an alarm signal to interpret the dynamics of acclimation and/or adaptation processes of forests in new environmental conditions. Moreover, responses at tree and stand levels are influenced by stand structure, tree species composition, genomic features and overall diversity. Therefore, adopting a holistic view in the interpretation of interactions between tree health and all the components and processes of the ecosystem is necessary and more realistic.</p>
