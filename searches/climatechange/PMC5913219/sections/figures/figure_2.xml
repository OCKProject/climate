  <p class="p">Blue and frost ring intensities by population and associated annual growth. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> The distribution and medians of blue ring and frost ring intensities, where provenances are sorted by the mean annual temperature of their source climate (warmest on the left, 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 117). 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> Show how growth is related to blue and frost ring intensities on an annual basis, where average blue and frost ring intensities (including zero values) are represented by the size of the circles. Provenances are colored according to their region and labeled by their identification number. 
   <bold class="bold">g</bold> The location of provenances and regions as well as the species range of lodgepole pine (dark gray) and the location of test sites sampled in this study (black triangles). The map was produced by the authors with ArcInfo 10.1 using vector and raster data from

   <bold class="bold">h</bold> The difference of the provenance source climate to the average climate of the test sites thereby indicates the degree and direction of climate transfers
