  <p class="p">Blue and frost rings as a function of growing degree days. Stained micro sections of tree rings are shown in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>. Safranin dyes lignin red and Astrablue dyes cellulose blue, so that the dual-staining procedure results in a blue ring where a layer of cells lacks lignin. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> An example for a blue ring of high intensity with a subsequent frost ring in position 1 (i.e., first cells of earlywood indicative of fall frost damage). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> A frost ring in position 2 (i.e., later in the earlywood indicative of spring frost damage), while 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> shows a normal tree ring. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> The occurrence of blue and frost rings by year. Gray bars indicate the sample size per year (total 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2999), light blue bars indicate the occurrence of blue rings, dark blue bars represent frost rings occurring in position 1, and the gray points represent frost rings in position 2. 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold> Bars represent growing season defined as frost free days, black circles represent early warming in spring, as the date on which cumulative degree days above 5 °C exceeded 100. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the average start and end of the growing seasons. 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> Examples of growing degree days above 5 °C among for a year with high occurrence of blue rings (1999), a year with frost rings in position 2 (1992), a year with no blue or frost rings (1998), as well as the overall average (1980–2005). The lines are smoothed using a 15-day running mean. 
   <bold class="bold">g</bold> The cumulative effect of the growing degree signatures shown in 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>
