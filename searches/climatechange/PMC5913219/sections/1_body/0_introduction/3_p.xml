<p id="Par5" class="p">Tree rings can provide additional information for evaluating cold adaptation since they provide a record of how past climate has influenced growth. Two wood anatomical features have been linked to cold and frost. First, layers of deformed, collapsed tracheids and traumatic parenchyma cells have been described as frost rings
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. Frost rings have been linked to generally colder years
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup> in which air temperatures fall below freezing during a period of cambial activity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>. Second, light rings consist of layers of cells that are incompletely lignified
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup> and have been associated with frost events that kill the cells before the lignification process is complete
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. Due to the lack of lignin, light rings do not fully absorb the red Safranin dye during a double staining procedure with Astrablue. This staining procedure causes non-lignified layers of cells to appear blue, hence light rings have also been referred to as blue rings
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. These blue rings (failed lignification)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> and frost rings (cambium damage)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup> therefore act as long-term archives of cold damage.
