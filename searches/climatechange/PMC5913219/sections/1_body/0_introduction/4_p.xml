<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we study these cold and frost signatures in trees grown in provenance trials, allowing us to quantify genetic differentiation in susceptibility to cold among populations. This can inform limits to seed transfers designed to address projected climate change. Our study species is lodgepole pine (

 </sup>. A subset of 20 provenances from across western Canada and the United States, grown at three central planting sites, were selected to analyze the response to climate transfers. We first investigate whether frost imprints in tree rings can act as a reliable indicator of cold susceptibility by analyzing the association of climate and cold events at the test sites with the occurrence of blue and frost rings. We further analyze frost imprints in the context of long-term growth data to quantify potential impacts of cold damage on productivity.
