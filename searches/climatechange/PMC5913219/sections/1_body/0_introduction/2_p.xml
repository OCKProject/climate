<p id="Par4" class="p">Due to their economic importance, adaptation and maladaptation of trees have been studied intensively with genetic provenance trial series, also known as common garden experiments

 </sup>. Seeds collected from across a species range (i.e., provenances are the geographic locations from which seed sources originate) are grown at multiple planting sites to reveal intra-specific genetic differentiation. Such reciprocal transplant experiments are ideal for studying plant–climate interactions and for assessing the risks involved in seed transfer to new locations

 </sup>. Growing northern seed sources at southern planting sites involves a climate transfer that can simulate projected warming, with the growth response being predictive of future performance under realistic long-term field conditions. Conversely, moving southern seeds northward can test the performance of warm-adapted populations under currently colder environments, thereby suggesting limits to seed transfer. Within these designs, genetic adaptation to cold in tree populations has been studied by observation of tissue damage after sporadic natural frost events and by exposing collected tissue samples to artificial freezing tests in the laboratory
