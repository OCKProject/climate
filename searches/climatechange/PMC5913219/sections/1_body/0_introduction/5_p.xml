<p id="Par7" class="p">Provenances from the northern extent of the species range were resistant to fall cold events but susceptible to spring frosts, implying a maladaptation under projected climate warming. Central populations were most productive but also most sensitive to early fall frosts. Meanwhile, transferring the most southern, warm-adapted genotypes northward caused rank-changing growth loss after a spring frost event. We conclude that opposing clines in spring and fall cold adaptation represent risks of both climate change and assisted migration.</p>
