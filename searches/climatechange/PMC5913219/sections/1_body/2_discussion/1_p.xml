 </sup>. The likely explanation for this counter-intuitive observation is that the northern population is adapted to a short growing season. Northern provenances flush earlier than southern seed sources for a given chilling and heat sum (measured in degree days) to take advantage of a limited growing season

 </sup>. However, this adaptive strategy may no longer be successful under anticipated climate change. This is especially relevant since temperature is more influential for spring flushing than photoperiod in most forest trees
