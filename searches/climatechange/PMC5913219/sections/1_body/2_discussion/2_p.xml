<p id="Par13" class="p">Another equally important finding is that this study confirms the need for transfer limits under assisted migration. Both the US and Southern Interior provenances were transferred to colder environments in this experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2h</xref>), with the test sites located either further north or higher in elevation than the provenance origins. Notably, the most productive Southern Interior provenances also showed the highest fall frost damage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e</xref>, Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a, b</xref>). Given that short growing seasons and low cumulative growing degree days are a likely cause of blue rings and frost rings in fall, a transfer of these seed sources to colder environments is likely to exacerbate this problem. While the US provenances did not incur additional fall cold damage relative to the Southern Interior region, spring frost susceptibility compromised their growth: A substantial decline in the US population’s tree-ring growth began shortly after a spring frost event in 1992 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>). Prior to this rank change (

Regarding transfers from colder to warmer environments, we observed an expected cline towards minimal blue-ring occurrences in northern provenances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), but no significant difference between the northern and central interior populations in fall frost damage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>).
