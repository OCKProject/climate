<p id="Par15" class="p">Although maladaptation under climate change is of concern for forests due to the long lifespan of trees, genetic maladaptation may occur in other widespread species where local adaptation exists. Assisted migration is being considered more broadly as a means of conserving biodiversity under climate change
