<p id="Par14" class="p">We conclude that expanding allowable distances of seed transfers can increase the risk of frost damage and potentially reduce growth. Cold adaptation should remain an important consideration when implementing long-distance seed transfers in temperate ecosystems designed to mitigate harmful effects of climate change. The study revealed opposing geographic clines for spring and fall frost damage, which both need to be considered to devise effective strategies to minimize risks in assisted migration prescriptions to address climate change. Provenance trials have been established for most of the major tree species of the temperate and boreal zone, and tree-ring analysis can be conducted non-destructively with increment borers to take full advantage of the information contained in these valuable transplant experiments. In tree improvement programs, breeding populations could be screened for cold tolerance
