<p id="Par9" class="p">An analysis of climate data at the common garden sites reveals that blue rings and frost rings in position 1 are linked to a late initiation of the growing season, an early end of the growing season, and a generally cool growing season (Supplementary Tables

 </sup>, the growing season length and overall growing conditions during the season have an impact on the occurrence of frost and blue rings if the lignification process is incomplete by the time the first fall frosts occur. For example, the year 1999 had high blue ring intensities, and was associated with both a cool spring and summer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>) and a low accumulation of warmth measured in growing degree days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1g</xref>). In contrast, no frost imprint was observed in 1998. This year had a long growing season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>), warm spring, hot summer and warm fall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>), which led to an above-average annual accumulation of growing degree days above 5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1g</xref>).
