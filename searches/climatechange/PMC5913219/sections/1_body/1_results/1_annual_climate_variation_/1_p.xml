<p id="Par8" class="p">In total, we examined 2999 tree rings from 117 trees from 20 different provenances grouped into four regional populations. Across all provenances, we recorded the occurrence of 689 blue rings (23%) and 204 frost rings (7%). In addition to occurrence, we assigned intensity scores, ranging from 1 to 5 (0 indicates absence). Blue rings occurred exclusively in the latewood (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), while frost ring damage occurred most often in the first rows of cells in the earlywood, labeled as position 1. The occurrence of the most severe blue rings in fall was usually followed by frost rings at position 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). It therefore appears that the blue ring captures a cold event at the end of the growing season that leads to cambial damage and irregular growth upon re-activation in the following spring. Occasionally, frost rings occurred in the earlywood after some tracheids had formed normally (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). These were labeled as frost rings in position 2 and we interpret them as damage caused by late spring frost events. Higher occurrences of blue and frost rings in the first ten years of the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>) may reflect higher vulnerability of small saplings to frost (Supplementary Fig
