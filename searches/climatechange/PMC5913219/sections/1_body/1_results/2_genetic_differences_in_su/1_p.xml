 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). See Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> for multiple comparisons among regional populations and the three cold response variables. The Southern Interior provenances were most affected by blue rings and fall frost rings, followed by the United States (US) group. The Northern provenances had the lowest levels of blue rings and fall frost rings, with the Central Interior provenances showed intermediate susceptibility (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b</xref>). In contrast, Northern provenances were most susceptible to spring frost damage as indicated by frost rings in position 2 (
 <italic class="italic">χ</italic>² = 9.2, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.026, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>). Notably, the geographic cline in vulnerability to spring frosts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) appears opposite to the geographic cline for fall frosts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b</xref>), with the most northern and coldest location of origin showing the highest intensity of frost rings in position 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g, h</xref>). Similarly, correlations to climate of seed origin (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) confirm that provenances adapted to northern, colder environments with larger temperature differences and shorter growing seasons incur less blue rings and fall frost damage but are more susceptible to spring frosts.
