<p id="Par17" class="p">Using a circular saw, one radial section capturing all tree rings from the pith to the bark was cut from each stem disks taken at 1.3 m in height. From there these 1-cm wide sections, transverse micro sections of 10–20 μm thickness were cut with a GSL-1 microtome

 </sup>: We applied a 1:1 mixture of Safranin and Astrablue to the micro sections for 5 min; washed them with distilled water; and then washed them with ethanol (70, 96 and 99%) to further remove surplus stain. Canada balsam was warmed to temporarily increase viscosity and applied to the micro sections, which were then covered by a glass cover slip. We then heated the micro sections in an oven at 60 °C for a minimum of 8 h to harden the Canada balsam. For illustration purposes, digital photos were taken with a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E upright microscope with a resolution of 5 megapixels and 12-bit color depth (Nikon DS-Fi2). Micrographs were taken at 20× magnification and automatically stitched together with the NIS-Elements software (Version 4.20.01, Nikon Corporation, 2014).
