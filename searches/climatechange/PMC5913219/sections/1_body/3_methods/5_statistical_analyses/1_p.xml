 </sup>. Due to the ordinal scale of the blue and frost ring scores, we used a cumulative link mixed model, implemented in the “clmm” function of the “ordinal” package for R

 </sup>. This model was used to analyze differences between populations and to assess relationships with climate. A logit link and flexible thresholds between the ordinal scores was used. Site, block, provenance and tree identifier were specified as random effects modifying the intercepts. The unique tree identifiers were included to account for repeated measures taken on each tree

 </sup>. Population was specified as fixed effect. In addition, several different climate variables were included as fixed effects. Continuous variables were scaled to ensure model convergence and tested for collinearity with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Climate variables were selected based on hypotheses about the cause of blue and frost rings. For blue rings, the Julian dates of the start and end of the growing season as well as the annual sum of growing degree days over 5 °C were tested. For frost rings at position 1, the Julian date of the end of the growing season and the annual sum of growing degree days over 5 °C of the previous year were included. Finally, for frost rings at position 2, the Julian date on which the sum of degree days over 5 °C exceeded 100 and the Julian date of the start of the growing season was tested. Categorical variables were assessed for collinearity with boxplots
