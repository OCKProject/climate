For illustration, and to account for the slightly imbalanced design and for variation in the length of the tree-ring series as trees reached the sampling height at different ages, least square means of blue and frost ring intensities were calculated with the “lsmeans” function of the “lme4” package

 </sup> after building a linear mixed effects model with the “lmer” function. Similarly, to assess the relationship between blue and frost rings and the normal climate at the provenances’ source locations, we calculated least square means of blue and frost ring intensities for the 20 provenances. Subsequently, we calculated Pearson’s correlation between climate normals and least square means of blue and frost ring intensities. Rank changes of populations were tested according to the Gail &amp; Simon likelihood ratio test

 </sup>. The Gail Simon likelihood ratio test is a method for testing the significance of qualitative or crossover interactions. A qualitative interaction exists where levels of a group perform better under some circumstances or treatment levels and vice versa. The null hypothesis is that the treatment effects in all sub-groups are in the same direction. In our case, we apply the Gail Simon test to evaluate the significance of rank changes in tree population growth under different time periods (pre- and post-frost in 1992).
