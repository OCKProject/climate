 </sup> for the grid-points closest to our site coordinates. This data is available through KNMI’s Climate Explorer (climexp.knmi.nl/). To capture general temperature conditions, as well as cold and frost events on an annual level, we calculated several additional climate variables. The start of the growing season was set as the last day in spring on which minimum temperatures dropped below 0 °C (Julian date). The end of the growing season was set to the Julian day on which the first frost (&lt;0 °C) occurred again in autumn. Growing season length was calculated as the number of Julian days between the start and the end of the growing season. Growing degree days were calculated as degree days above 5 °C to characterize conditions within the growing season. To capture spells of warm weather early in the spring, before the last frosts have occurred, the Julian day of the year at which the sum of growing degree days over 5 °C exceeded 100 was calculated. To investigate the relationship between blue and frost rings and the climate at the seed source locations, we interpolated climate normal data for the 1961–1990 period with the software ClimateNA
