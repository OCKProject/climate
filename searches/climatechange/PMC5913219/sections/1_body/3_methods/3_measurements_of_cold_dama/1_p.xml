<p id="Par18" class="p">Blue and frost ring occurrences were recorded at the tree-ring level using a light microscope at 100× magnification; sample labels were coded to prevent observer bias. We assigned an intensity score for blue and frost rings on a scale of zero to five (Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>): A zero indicates absence and a one represents a faint blue band in at least one row of cells, while a five represents a larger band of completely un-lignified cells often associated with narrower and distorted cell walls (Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Frost rings are characterized by deformed tracheids of varying sizes, thin cell walls, and damaged ray parenchyma

 </sup>. Frost rings that occurred directly at the ring boundary in the earlywood were labeled as position 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Their position indicates cold events in winter prior to—or at the time of—cambial reactivation. Frost rings labeled as position 2 occurred after several rows of earlywood tracheids had already formed normally, thereby pointing to a spring cold event after growth had already been initiated (Fig.
