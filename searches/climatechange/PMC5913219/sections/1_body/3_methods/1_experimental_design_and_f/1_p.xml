 </sup>. One-year-old seedlings were planted in 1974 and most trees died in 2006 due to the mountain pine beetle epidemic. We used a representative sub-set from this trial for detailed wood anatomical analyses: Five provenances from British Columbia’s North and southern Yukon (N); five provenances each from British Columbia’s Central Interior (CI) and Southern Interior (SI); and five provenances from the United States (US). These 20 provenances were replicated on three experimental sites in British Columbia’s Southern Interior (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Each site consists of two blocks, with provenances planted in plots of nine trees. From each plot, we selected one tree of median height for wood anatomical analyses, although three samples were not suitable due to early mortality or rot. Thus, a sub-sample of 117 trees was used.
