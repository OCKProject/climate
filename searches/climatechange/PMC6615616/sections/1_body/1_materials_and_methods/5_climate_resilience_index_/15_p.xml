<p class="p">On the other hand, in order to enable inter-household comparison as well as to explore most relevant indicators for intervention action in enhancing resilience to climate change-induced shocks, methods other than balanced weighted approach are more useful. In this aspect, the factorial analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the multivariate techniques applied to both data reduction and identification of the dominant factors for householdsâ€™ resilience [

 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Mathematically, a principal component is a multivariate technique that used to extract an initial set of n correlated variables into few uncorrelated (orthogonal) linear combinations of factors that capture the common information most successfully called principal component [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Intuitively, the principal component is a linear weighted index of all the variables presented in an ordered fashion, where the first principal component (PC1) explains the largest amount of variation in the original data. The second principal component (PC2) is entirely uncorrelated to the first principal component and explains additional but less variation than the PC1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Thus, components are completely uncorrelated to the previous components and each component contains an additional but smaller proportion of variation than the original variables [
