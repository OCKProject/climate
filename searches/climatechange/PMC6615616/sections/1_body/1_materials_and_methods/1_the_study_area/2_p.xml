Subsistence rain-fed agriculture integrated with livestock production is the dominant livelihood strategy for the majority of households. Traditional irrigation is rarely practiced in downstream residents to grow vegetables and perennial crops. Barley (

 <italic class="italic">sum sativum</italic>) are the dominant crops grown in the uplands, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Eragrostis tef</italic>, wheat (
 <italic class="italic">Triticum vugare</italic>), horse beans (
 <italic class="italic">Vicia fabia</italic>), etc. are prevalent in middle watershed. Whereas Zea maize and Vigna radiate (
