Whereas the “resilience-with-what” searches for possible assets and livelihood options that contribute to building the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities [

The same leading questions constituting of the aforementioned concepts were also used to conduct 15 face-to-face interviews on community members selected by a snowball technique, where participants are selected upon the recommendation of others.
