<p class="p">The result of the principal component analysis based on the resilience blocks generated four possible components contributing to a cumulative variance of 82.99% using an eigenvalue cut-off of 1.0. The four factors explained 42.24%, 14.98%, 13.55% and 12.22% of variations, respectively. Accordingly, except climate change and variability, all the remaining components were positively and heavily correlated with resilience. As a whole, IFA on factor 1 was the most important component contributing to resilience; whereas AC, ABS and SC were also vital components supporting resilience to climate change-induced shocks (

As a result, in Dinki watershed socio-ecological system, integrated management of all the resilience blocks contributes to enhancing householdsâ€™ resilience to climate change-induced shocks. However, dimensions like income and food access, adaptive capacity, access to basic services and social capital should get great concern and priorities to enhance resilience to shock impacts.
