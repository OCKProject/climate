It is hypothesized that households who have access to basic public services as well as who actively participate in the governance system will have access to information, create positive social bonding and relatively more resilient than their counterparts. In this study, the coefficients of market, credit and road network in the aggregated points were 0.12, 0.08 and 0.17, respectively. This indicates that for a HH having one kilometer nearest access to market, credit and road facilities, the probability of recovery following shock impacts could increase by 12%, 8%, and 17%, respectively. Similarly, the coefficient of vertical linkage was 0.14, indicating for every one household head participated in the governance system, the probability to enhance resilience would increase by 14% (
