<p class="p">Key informants noted that infrastructure, mainly road and market are a basis for further societal developments. In this aspect, access to basic infrastructures is minimal where only 18.06 and 55.56% of households access all-weather road and market within five km distance, respectively, making the study communities isolated from market centers. In agreement with this finding, studies state that underdeveloped infrastructure is a driving cause for insufficient access to public services, minimal market integration and little returns on investments [

Access to credit services was also minimal where only 59.38% of households access to credit facilities in their proximity. Studies state that insufficient physical structures significantly limit access to basic services like health and credit facilities, contributing socioeconomic marginalization [
