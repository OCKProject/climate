It is hypothesized that households having exposure to shock events, those whose most of their farmlands are infertile and located in steep slopes are more vulnerable to climate change-induced shocks like soil erosion, landslides, food insecurity, etc. These households are more likely to be poorly resilient to climate change-induced shocks due to their higher sensitivity and limited livelihood options. In this study, households who experience shock events have -0.459 point, indicating for a household exposed to one shock event, the likelihood of recovery would decline by 46% than households who have not exposed to any shock. Likewise, household who have a higher proportion of infertile and steep slope (inconvenient to farm) farmlands have -0.24 and -18.78 points, respectively. On the other hand, households who have access to the early warning system, awareness on climate change impacts, experience sharing of resources and technology during shocks events, having a higher proportion of farmland under soil and water conservation measures have 0.07, 0.18. 0.12 and 0.13 points of likelihoods to become more resilient to climate change-induced shocks (
