<p class="p">Discussants reported that that household whose farmlands are located in steep slopes and near to river banks is highly vulnerable to soil erosion and flooding impacts. Likewise, land fertility is also reported as a principal factor influencing households’ productivity and wealth status. Accordingly, households whose farmlands are in gentle slope and with better soil fertility are better off in production and are relatively resilient to shock impacts than their counterparts. Discussants and key informants identified that land resource management practices mainly through soil and water conservation contribute to influencing households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks like soil erosion. In effect, households who experience intensive soil and water conservation measures are less likely impacted by erosion and more likely to recover quickly against the adverse impacts of erosion. Thus, poorly resilient households are those whose most of their lands are located in steep slopes, proximate to river banks, with infertile and minimal soil and water conservation practices and thereby less resilient to shock impacts.</p>
