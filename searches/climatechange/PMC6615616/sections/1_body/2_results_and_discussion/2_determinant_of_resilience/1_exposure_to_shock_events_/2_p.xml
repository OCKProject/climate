<p class="p">The result of the household survey was also complemented by the key informant and FGD participants. They presented the socio-ecological dynamics of Dinki watershed during the last 50 (1968â€“2016) years. Accordingly, land degradation, change of state, food insecurity, disease manifestation, market fluctuation and erosion of indigenous knowledge and practices were identified as key disturbances during the study period. Of which, climate change and variability, land degradation and erosion of indigenous knowledge and practices were identified as the three top changes affecting the study community using pairwise ranking. In this connection, the participants perceive resilience as a state of recovery against climate change-induced shocks without significant help from external institutions. However, the effects of climate change-induced shocks and consecutive rate of recovery are not uniform across households. In effect, households in Dinki watershed socio-ecological system were classified into poor resilient, moderately resilient and resilient based on their recovery time to climate change-induced shocks. Such classification was also reported in other parts of Ethiopia [
