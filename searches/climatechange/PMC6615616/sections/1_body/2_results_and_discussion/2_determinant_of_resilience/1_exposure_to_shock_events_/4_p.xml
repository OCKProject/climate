<p class="p">In agreement with the current result, studies state that climate change has a negative impact on households’ resilience. In effect, improving access to assets, early warning system and social safety nets could contribute to mitigate with and adapt to the effects of climatic extremes [

Moreover, in Ethiopian farming community, the indigenous knowledge through weather forecasting (example: cloud color, wind direction, sound of birds, etc.) contributes to decide on farming, harvesting and associated daily activities [

For instance, in undulating terrain areas like in the study area, farming and settlements expand to steep slopes and forested areas, resulting in accelerated soil erosion as well as erosion of households’ resilience to shock impacts [
