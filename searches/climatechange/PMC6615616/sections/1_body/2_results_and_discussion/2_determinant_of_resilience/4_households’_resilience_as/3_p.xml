<p class="p">Relatively higher score of absorptive capacity in the lowland agro-ecology is evident by the fact that its exposure to recurrent climate change-induced shocks might have enabled residents to acquire more knowledge and get prepared for future likely shocks. Besides, large farm and livestock holding, social capital (CBOs, SSS, sharing of resources and technology) as well as coping strategies (in economic and management options) might have enabled lowland residents to better absorb shocks compared to the highland and midland agro-ecological zones.</p>
