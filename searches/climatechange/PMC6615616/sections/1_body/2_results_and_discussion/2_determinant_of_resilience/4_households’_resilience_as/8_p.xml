 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The graph was established based on households’ income per capita and mean LRI values drawn on x and y-axes, respectively. Accordingly, based on the mean LRI value (0.44), households falling above the mean were poor but resilient, resilient and extremely resilient. Whereas rich but not resilient, vulnerable and extremely vulnerable households were presented below the mean. Likewise, based on the mean monthly income (18.66 per month or 0.622 USD per day), households falling to the right of the mean include rich but not resilient, resilient and extremely resilient. Whereas households who were poor but resilient, vulnerable and extremely vulnerable were presented in the left of the mean (
