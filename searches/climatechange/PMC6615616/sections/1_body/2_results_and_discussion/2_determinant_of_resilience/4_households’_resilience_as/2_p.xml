<p class="p">The livelihood resilience analysis through resilience capacities more clearly differentiated the agro-ecological zones in terms of their absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities. In effect, the leading contributing factor to the resilience of Dinki watershed socio-ecological system to climate change-induced shocks was observed to be absorptive capacity with a mean index value of 0.495 followed by adaptive capacity with a mean index value of 0.449 (
