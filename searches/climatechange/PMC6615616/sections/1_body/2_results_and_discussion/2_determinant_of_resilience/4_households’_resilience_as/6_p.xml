<p class="p">Although the mean resilience score in terms of transformative capacity (0.387) is lower to other resilience scores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219393.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>), the lowland showed the highest transformative capacity (0.402) than the other agro-ecological zones (
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). A relatively higher proportion of households who access market in their proximity coupled with higher social capital (transformative) scores through conflict management and vertical linkages in the Lowland and Highland might have contributed to higher transformative capacity in these agro-ecological zones. In this aspect, disputes over access to water, pasture and related land resources are repeatedly reported as major sources of conflict in the study community. As a result, conflict management options through eldersâ€™ institutions might have contributed to building peace and security among the study communities.
