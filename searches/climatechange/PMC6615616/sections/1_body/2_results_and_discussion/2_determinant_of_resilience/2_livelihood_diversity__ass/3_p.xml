<p class="p">Discussant added that access to and size of farmland is the principal factor that determines householdâ€™ resilience to shock impacts. They stressed that land ownership is a priority for the farming community for long-term decision and soil fertility management options. Accordingly, landless households are less likely to work on natural resource management practices even may amplify environmental degradation through overexploitation. Whereas, households with large farm sizes are more likely to invest on land and soil fertility management works, diversify income sources (crop-livestock integration, polyculture, agroforestry, etc.) and more likely to bounce back quickly against shock impacts. In agreement with this finding, studies state that landlessness and small land holding are determinant factors causing land degradation and resilience erosion [
