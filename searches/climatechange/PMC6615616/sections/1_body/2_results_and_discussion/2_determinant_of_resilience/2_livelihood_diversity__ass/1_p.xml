It is hypothesized that households who have multiple income sources, large asset holding and strong social capital become more resilient to climate change-induced shocks than their counterparts. In this study the coefficient of income diversity was 0.14, indicating the probability of increasing recovery following shock impacts by 14% if the household added one enterprise than normal livelihood system. Likewise, the coefficient of the number of coping strategies was 0.09, indicating 9% of faster recovery if the household experience one more coping strategy to shock impacts than the normal system (
