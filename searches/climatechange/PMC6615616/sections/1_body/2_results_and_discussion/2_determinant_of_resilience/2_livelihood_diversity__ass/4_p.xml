<p class="p">Livestock holding is argued to signify wealth and dignity in rural Ethiopia. Discussants disclosed that livestock ownership is a determining factor for household livelihood and sustainability; as households having domestic animals are more likely to enhance and diversify income sources. However, the number and diversity of animals critically influence their economic returns. Accordingly, Oxen ownership is a priority for every farmer to secure his agricultural production. The next priority is reported to have milking cow to sustain livestock production and dietary diversity. Depending on the agro-ecology and households’ choice, having transportation animals, such as donkey/horse/mule/camel would be the next interest. Because, in areas with limited car access, like the study area, humans and materials, including agricultural inputs (fertilizer, improved seeds, pesticides), market inputs and related commodities are transported through these animals; markedly supporting livelihood options, asset accumulation and recovery to shocks. As a result, households with more than two TLU (a minimum of 2 Oxen or 1 Ox + 1 cow) are more likely to be more resilient to climate change-induced shocks. In line with this finding, a study in other parts of Ethiopia states that asset holding, including land and livestock unit, is determinant to diversify income sources, improves income and critical for the households’ resilience to food insecurity [
