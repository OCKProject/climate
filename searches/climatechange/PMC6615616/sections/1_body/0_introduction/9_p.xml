Therefore, research questions, including: (i) how is the term resilience conceptualized in Dinki watershed communities? (ii) are there differences in absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities between agro-ecological zones? And (iii) what are the determinant factors that influence householdsâ€™ resilience to climate change-induced shocks in Dinki watershed? were formulated to address the desired objective.</p>
