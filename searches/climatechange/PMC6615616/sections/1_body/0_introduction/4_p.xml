<p class="p">The intensification of two huge societal trends-climate change and globalization, which amplify multifaceted and non-directional impacts have caused resilience to be acknowledged in a wide range of disciplines globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The concept of resilience stems from the Latin ‘resilire’ to denote to ‘bouncing back’ or ‘recoiling’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. It was primarily applied in mechanics in 1858 referring to the capability of a material to resist a force (rigidity) as well as to absorb the force with deformation; later it was used in psychology in 1950s, in system ecology in 1973 and in social-ecological systems in the 1990s [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In recent understanding, resilience is conceptualized beyond engineering resilience (absorptive capacity)- “capacity to resist shock and bounce-back” and ecological resilience (adaptive capacity)- “capacity to buffer, adjust, and continue to functioning following shocks”[
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]; instead it also includes the transformative capacity_” capacity to create a fundamentally new system in times of crises” [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In terms of climate change, absorptive capacity refers the “ability to cope with the consequences”, adaptive capacity refers the “ability to adjust changes, moderate damage and to take opportunities” [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Whereas, transformative capacity refers to the “ability to create a new system to make conditions attainable” [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The majority of academics and experts from a wide range of disciplines recognize resilience with a multiplicity of abilities, including “ability to resist and bounce back”, “ability to moderate changes and continue operating”, “ability to create a new system in times of crises” [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These abilities collectively denoted to the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These capacities are termed as the core-components of resilience [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] or the three-structural elements that need to be considered during the resilience analytical framework. On the other hand, the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities result in persistence, incremental adjustments, and transformational responses, respectively. Moreover, resilience itself was recognized as an outcome variable in many disciplines [
