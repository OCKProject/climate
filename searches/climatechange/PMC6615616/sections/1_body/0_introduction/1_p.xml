 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. These shocks are short-lived, abrupt, occur very rarely, lasting only from several hours to several days. Weather shocks are noticeable due to their severe impact from the usual weather pattern and cause adverse impacts on humans, infrastructure and ecosystems. Examples include very high (low) temperature, very heavy rainfall, extreme heat, flooding, drying, very high wind speed, etc. Extreme events which last for longer periods (months to years) are termed as extreme climate events [
