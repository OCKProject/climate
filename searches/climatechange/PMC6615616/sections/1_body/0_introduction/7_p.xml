<p class="p">In the case of high intensity (chronic leading to maximum impact due to frequency or long duration) and recurrent shocks, it may be difficult to sustain system functioning through adaptive resilience, involving transformative resilience. It is often associated to system-level changes in factors like infrastructure (example: road, communication, credit access, health facilities, etc.), governance, formal safety nets which substantially strengthen long-term resilience [

For instance, changing of the agrarian livelihood into resource extraction economy, ecotourism, change in resource management practices, etc. Transformative resilience may require institutional reforms, behavioral changes and technological innovations [

The nexus between shock intensity and the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities is linear where absorptive involves enhancing resistance in times of small-scale disturbance; adaptation during greater disturbance and transformative when conditions become extremely unattainable [
