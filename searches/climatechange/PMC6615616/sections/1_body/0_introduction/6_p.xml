<p class="p">The three resilience capacities can be linked depending on shock intensity. Accordingly, during minimal shock intensity (minimal impact or infrequent), it is natural that the system would block or resist it [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Hence, internal resistance is known as the natural characteristic of a system manifested on a daily basis where resources could block the shock enabling the system to continue functioning-highly comparable to the human immune system [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Absorptive capacity is especially basis to buffer short-term disturbances as well as during the beginning phase of coping of huge shocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The next adaptive resilience involving system adjustment to sustain system functioning will be exercised if the shock exceeded the absorptive capacity [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Adaptive capacity is “the ability of a system to adjust itself to sustain system functioning”[
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. These adjustment practices are incremental as well as learning through failure and success that adds to adaptability [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This capacity involves “resourcefulness-the potential to identify challenges, develop priorities, mobilize resources, to integrate experience and knowledge during crises, to plan for upcoming shock impacts” [
 <xref rid="pone.0219393.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These multi-level (individuals, households, community) and incremental adjustment mechanisms for farming communities may include livelihood diversification, establishing market networks, empowering storage facilities, developing pooling among communities, introducing of shock resistance varieties, new farming practices, strengthening social networks, etc. [
