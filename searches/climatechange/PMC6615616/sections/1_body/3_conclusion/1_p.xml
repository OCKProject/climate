<p class="p">In this study, the Climate Resilience Index based on resilience capacities frame has differentiated the agro-ecological zones in terms of their absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities. Besides, the principal component analysis has generated major factors that contribute to households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks. Likewise, the multiple regression analysis identified the determinants of resilience. The methods presented a detail description of factors contributing to households’ resilience to shock impacts. As a result, access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands, livestock, livelihood diversification, infrastructure, as well as social capital and ecological stability are identified to influence households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks. However, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with constrained adaptive capacities like limited diversification practices, poor access to infrastructure, underdeveloped social capital, among others, the mean resilience score of the study communities is minimal. Similarly, although improved absorptive capacity through early warning system, social protection, climate change information, etc. contributes to prepare, anticipate and cope with shock impacts, it is equally important to strengthen both the adaptive (adjustment strategies) and transformative (system-level change) capacities to ensure long-term resilience in the study communities.</p>
