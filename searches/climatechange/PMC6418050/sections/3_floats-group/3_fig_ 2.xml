  <p class="p">Relationship between daytime maximum temperature and subsequent night-time distances traveled by African wild dogs outside the denning period on nights with

   <bold class="bold">b</bold> high (12-h full moon equivalents) levels of moonlight. Gray points represent the raw data, with the shaded curves representing the kernel density of the data in that 1 °C temperature band. Black circles represent model estimates, with black horizontal lines indicating the standard errors. The model outputs were calculated using mean daily rainfall
