 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2015</xref>) respond to high ambient temperatures by changing their behaviors. Such plasticity has the potential to mitigate climate change impacts (Martin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, these thermoregulatory behaviors often come with a fitness cost, such as a decrease in foraging time, or reduced vigilance, which may impact survival and reproduction as the climate warms (Sinervo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2010</xref>; du Plessis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2012</xref>; Cunningham et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2015</xref>; Turbill and Prior 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2016</xref>). Speciesâ€™ behavioral responses are, therefore, likely to be key in determining the extent to which a species is impacted by rising temperatures.
