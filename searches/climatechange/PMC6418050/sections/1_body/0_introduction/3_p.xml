<p id="Par4" class="p">Species can adapt to climate change in three ways: adaptation in time, whereby they shift their phenology, moving the timing of critical life events, such as breeding, in response to changing seasonality; adaptation in space, where species’ ranges shift to remain within appropriate climatic conditions; and adaptation in self, whereby individuals of a species alter their behavior or physiology in response to changing temperatures (Foden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>, Pacifici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). Such adaptation to climate change can either occur through evolutionary change, whereby traits are inherited through generations, or through phenotypic plasticity, whereby species’ traits are altered without altering their genes, often within the lifetime of an individual, in ways which mitigate climate change impacts. These traits can include species’ physical characteristics, geographic range, physiology or behaviors, as well as changes to species phenology. However, most studies and models of climate change vulnerability either look solely at the correlation between species occurrence and climatic variables, ignoring the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts (Kearney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2010</xref>; Pacifici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>), or else focus on physiological rather than behavioral traits (Bellard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2012</xref>). In studies where models of climate responses have incorporated behavioral thermoregulation, they have generally been focused on ectotherms (Kearney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2009</xref>; Huey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2012</xref>).
