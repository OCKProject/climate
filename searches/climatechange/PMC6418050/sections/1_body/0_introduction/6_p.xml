<p id="Par7" class="p">A primary opportunity for African wild dogs to adapt to rising temperatures is through a change in self. Shifting activity to night-time, which is cooler than daytime, has been suggested as one of the primary ways large mammals may mitigate the impacts of rising temperatures (Fuller et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, nocturnal hunts also occur (Cozzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>), especially on moonlit nights, and increasing the frequency of nocturnal hunting might allow wild dogs to exploit lower night-time temperatures, potentially offsetting climate change impacts. Such a coping strategy might be especially important during the 3-month period each year when pups are confined to a den and adults’ energy demands are highest (Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>).
