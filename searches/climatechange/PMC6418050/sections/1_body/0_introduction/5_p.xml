<p id="Par6" class="p">The African wild dog is a highly social carnivore, with pack members cooperating to hunt, raise young, and defend resources (Creel and Creel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2002</xref>). The species is globally endangered; the wild population numbers fewer than 700 packs, confined to just 7% of the speciesâ€™ former range within sub-Saharan Africa (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2012</xref>). Being highly mobile, with a relatively flexible diet, the species has few of the traits typically associated with climate change vulnerability (Bellard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2012</xref>; Pacifici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). Indeed, it has been suggested that wild dogs may benefit from rising temperatures that may reduce the ability of large-bodied prey, for example, wildebeest (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, demographic evidence indicates consistently harmful effects of hot weather on wild dogs, with high ambient temperatures associated with lower recruitment across multiple populations (Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). Wild dogs hunt less on hot days, and these demographic impacts may reflect consequently lower food intake (Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>).
