<p id="Par24" class="p">Denning, rainfall, temperature and moonlight were key predictors of activity and distances traveled across the 24-h period from dawn to dawn, for denning and non-denning periods combined. Contrasting with hypothesis (i) African wild dogs traveled less far and were less active on hot days both inside and outside the denning period. This negative effect of temperature, however, was greater inside the denning period than outside it, as indicated by the inclusion of a negative interaction between the effects of temperature and denning in the top models for both activity and distances traveled, and the importance of maximum temperature as a predictor of activity and distances traveled in the denning period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Despite being included in the top models, rainfall, days at the den site and pup age had little impact on activity and distances traveled, with confidence intervals for all estimates crossing zero.
