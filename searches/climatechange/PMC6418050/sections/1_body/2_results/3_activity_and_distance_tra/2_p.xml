<p id="Par25" class="p">Across the denning and non-denning periods African wild dogs were more active, and traveled further, across a 24-h period when moonlight levels were higher, in line with hypothesis (ii). As predicted by hypothesis (iii) African wild dogs were more active and traveled further during the denning period compared to outside the denning period across a 24-h period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Top models for activity during the denning period included interactions between temperature and days spent at the den site, and temperature and rainfall. These were only included in 2 out of 12 top models, however, and had small positive effects.
