<p id="Par21" class="p">Moonlight, temperature, rainfall and denning status were important predictors of wild dog activity and distances traveled by night. In line with hypothesis (i) packs increased night-time activity and distance traveled following hot days outside the denning period, (Denning (No) in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Contrary to our predictions, however, wild dogs did not significantly increase their nocturnal activity and distances traveled following hot days when denning (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The lack of increase in activity and distances traveled following hot days is indicated by negative interactions between the effects of temperature and denning on both distance traveled and activity levels in the models of denning and non-denning periods combined. This pattern is also shown by the 95% confidence intervals in the models of activity during the denning period crossing zero, and the negative relationship between temperature and distances traveled during the denning period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Rainfall was of high importance for the denning and non-denning periods combined, being included in all top models for activity, and 3 out of 4 top models for distance traveled. Rainfall was included in a much lower proportion of the top models in the denning period, and the effect sizes were smaller. African wild dogs were more active at night when rainfall was higher.
