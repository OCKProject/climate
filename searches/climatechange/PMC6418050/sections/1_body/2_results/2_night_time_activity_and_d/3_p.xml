<p id="Par23" class="p">In line with hypothesis (iii) wild dogs were more active and traveled further during the denning period than outside it. Days at den and pup age were of relatively low importance as predictors of wild dog activity and distances traveled during denning, and the 95% confidence intervals associated with the effect sizes crossed zero in all cases. Within the models for activity in the denning period only, there was an interaction between the effects of maximum temperature and days spent at a particular den site included in the top model set; however, this variable was included in just 1 of the top 8 models and the effect size was small (TableÂ
