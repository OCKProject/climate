<p id="Par19" class="p">Our analyses suggested that temperature, rainfall and denning status were all important predictors of African wild dog activity and distance traveled by day. During daylight hours, wild dogs were less active and traveled shorter distances on days when maximum daily temperatures were higher throughout both the denning and non-denning periods (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Wild dogs also traveled less far when daily rainfall was higher during both denning and non-denning periods, but rainfall had a smaller effect, and was of lower importance, in the models of the denning period alone. An interaction between the effects of maximum temperature and rainfall was included in all top model sets; however, the effect size was small, with the 95% confidence interval crossing zero in all cases other than the models for activity in the denning and non-denning periods combined. Rainfall appears to slightly lessen the impact of high temperatures on daytime activity and distances traveled; however, this effect is less pronounced, or even reversed in the case of distance traveled, during the denning period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
