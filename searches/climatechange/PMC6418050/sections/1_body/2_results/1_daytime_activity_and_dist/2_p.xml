<p id="Par20" class="p">In line with hypothesis iii) wild dogs were more active and traveled further during the denning period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). During the denning period, wild dogs were also more active and traveled longer distances when the pack had spent more days using a specific den site (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The interaction between days using a den site and maximum temperature was of low importance, included in 2 out of 6 of the top model sets, with a small positive interaction between maximum temperature and days spent at the den site. Pup age was included in the top model sets of activity and distance traveled during the denning period, and had a small negative effect on both.
