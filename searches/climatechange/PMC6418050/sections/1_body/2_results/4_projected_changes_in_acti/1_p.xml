<p id="Par26" class="p">Climate change projections suggested that the study site was expected to warm by between 1.6 and 3.9 degrees, and to experience lower rainfall levels by 2070 (Online Resource 11, Online Resource 12). In the best case climate scenario, wild dogs were predicted to reduce 24-h activity and distance traveled outside the denning period by 1%, reducing daytime activity by 5% but increasing nocturnal activity by 7%, and reducing daytime distance traveled by 4%, while increasing distance traveled at night by 6% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). During the denning period, however, the models predicted greater reductions in 24-h activity and distance traveled. African wild dogs were predicted to decrease 24-h activity and distances traveled by 4% and 8%, respectively, at average moonlight levels (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).
