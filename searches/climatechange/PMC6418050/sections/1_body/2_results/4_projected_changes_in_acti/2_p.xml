<p id="Par27" class="p">Greater impacts were predicted in the worst case climate scenario, with wild dogs projected to reduce activity and distances traveled across a 24-h period by 2% outside the denning period, with a decrease in activity of 12% in the day and an increase of 18% at night. A decrease in daytime distances traveled of 10% was predicted, alongside a subsequent increase of 15% in night-time distance traveled. Inside the denning period, when wild dogs have first started using a den site, they were predicted to be 8% less active and travel distances 14% lower across a 24-h period than under current temperatures (TableÂ
