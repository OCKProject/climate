<p id="Par10" class="p">Data were collected between 2011 and 2016. We fitted GPS-collars (GPS-plus, Vectronic Aerospace GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to 15 wild dogs in 8 different packs; there was only one active GPS collar on each pack at any one time. Wild dogs were darted from a vehicle from a distance of 10–15 m—further details of collar deployment methods are provided in Woodroffe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2011</xref>). Individual wild dogs were GPS-collared for an average of 207 days (SD = 126); details of the monitoring dates and packs of individual study animals are shown in Online Resource 1. The collars contained accelerometers that recorded average acceleration in two (unspecified) dimensions every 5 min on a scale of 0–255. GPS collars were programmed to record locations at specific times throughout the day and night. The programmed number of GPS locations per 24-h period varied between individuals from 6 to 13 (Online Resource 2). The GPS collars incorporated VHF beacons, and additional pack-members were also fitted with VHF collars to help in locating the pack in case of GPS collar failure. We downloaded the data from GPS collars over a remote VHF link. We also made visual observations of wild dog behavior throughout the study which corroborated the timing of periods of activity recorded by the collars. We identified denning dates, and dates when packs moved den sites, using GPS collar data, based on the distinctive movement pattern of repeatedly returning to the same location (Woodroffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2010</xref>). African wild dog packs switch den sites multiple times throughout a denning period—with an average of 5 den moves (SD 2.85) from birth until the last den is abandoned when pups are approximately 3 months old (Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2017</xref>). Because den site changes repeatedly during the denning period, the number of days spent at each den site is not strongly correlated with pup age (Online Resource 3).
