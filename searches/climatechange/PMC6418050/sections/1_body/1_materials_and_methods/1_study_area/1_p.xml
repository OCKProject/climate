<p id="Par9" class="p">The study area covers Laikipia county in Northern Kenya (37°2′E, 0°6′N), and parts of neighboring Samburu, Isiolo and Baringo counties. The habitat mainly comprises semi-arid bushland and savannah, with livestock farming and tourism as the primary land uses. Despite not being formally protected, as the majority of land is under private or community ownership, many landowners promote wildlife and tourism alongside pastoralism and ranching activities, leading to high levels of wildlife abundance and diversity. Mean annual rainfall is 590 mm varying from around 400 mm per year in the North East to over 900 mm per year in the South West, with highly variable seasonality. Daily maximum temperatures range from 25 to 36 °C with minimum temperatures falling between 12° and 17 °C (Caylor et al.
