<p id="Par16" class="p">Due to the distribution of the model residuals (Online Resource 6), gamma generalized linear mixed-effects models were fitted to all datasets. Residuals were checked for normality and heterogeneity by eye using Q–Q plots (Online Resource 7). An information theoretic approach was used to select the top model set, comparing the corrected AIC (AICc) between models. As this approach yields several acceptable models, a model averaging approach was used to determine final estimates (Burnham and Anderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2002</xref>). The relative importance of fixed effects was evaluated by averaging parameter estimates across the top models (ΔAIC ≤ 5). As some literature suggests that ΔAIC ≤ 2 (Harrison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2018</xref>) should be used as a cut off, we also report the number of models in the ΔAIC ≤ 2 set that each fixed effect was included in. Tables of the top models are presented in Online Resource 8. All independent variables were tested for intercorrelation and all Pearson’s correlations were found to be below 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.25 (Online Resource 9). We carried out all analyses in R version 3.3.2 (R Core Team 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2018</xref>) and used the 
 <italic class="italic">lme4</italic> (Bates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2015</xref>) package to fit models. The package
