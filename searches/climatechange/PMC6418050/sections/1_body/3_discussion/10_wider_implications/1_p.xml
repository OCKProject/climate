<p id="Par37" class="p">Behavioral plasticity is likely to be a key determinant of the severity of climate change impacts across a wide variety of species. Mammals have some of the most complex behaviors of any taxa, and behavioral plasticity is likely to play an important part in their responses to climate change (McCain and King 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such flexibility may be particularly significant for crepuscular species, since, as temperatures rise, each day will include fewer hours when low ambient temperatures coincide with high light levels. Behavior changes at higher temperatures are likely to be key in determining species’ climate change responses, and ultimately impacts of climate change on the species’ viability in the future. It is vital that crepuscular species’ ability to become active at night is investigated in future research.
