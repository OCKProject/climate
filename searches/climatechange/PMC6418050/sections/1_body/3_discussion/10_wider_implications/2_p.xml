<p id="Par38" class="p">The ability of species to shift their behavior in response to high temperatures is likely to be an important determinant of the extent to which they can adapt to rising temperatures. However, thermoregulatory behaviors must be traded off against other behaviors, such as foraging (Cunningham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2015</xref>), and have been found to impact reproduction in some species (Cunningham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2013</xref>). In the African wild dog, the thermoregulatory behavior of lower activity during the day on hot days, coupled with their constrained behavioral shift to nocturnality during the denning period, is likely to result in lower pup survival. It is important that such trade-offs are identified, and their effects on population dynamics and viability established, for other species. To identify these impacts, long-term, detailed, studies of species are essential. Behavioral shifts need to be incorporated into vulnerability assessments of species through including the behavioral plasticity of species into trait-based assessments where this information is available. For species with high conservation priority, mechanistic, species-specific assessments which incorporate detailed behavioral responses to climate change are likely to be most appropriate in informing future conservation actions.
