Poor nocturnal vision would make both hunting and avoidance of competitors challenging, as wild dogs may be less able to detect lions and hyaenas during nights with less light, resulting in greater levels of kleptoparasitism and mortality. However, wild dogs’ nocturnality was also largely restricted to moonlit nights at a site with very low lion and hyaena numbers (Pole
