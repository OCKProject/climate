<p id="Par36" class="p">Our findings highlight the constraints to climate change adaptation in African wild dogs. There is little opportunity for wild dogs to adapt to rising temperatures in space, since their distribution is already limited by habitat loss and human activity (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2012</xref>). For wild dog ranges to expand into new areas, there would need to be an extensive programme of habitat restoration and translocations (Gusset et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2008</xref>). As they already breed at the coolest period of the year where this period is predictable (McNutt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2017</xref>), there is no opportunity for shifts in the timing of breeding to compensate for rising temperatures. Previous studies have suggested that large mammals like the African wild dog are unlikely to be able to adapt to rising temperatures through evolutionary change, as their long generation times mean that climate change is likely to outpace the speciesâ€™ rate of evolution (Fuller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2016</xref>). Since wild dogs have little potential for adaptation in time and space, and are limited in their rate of evolutionary change by long generation times, this leaves behavioral adaptation as one of the most plausible forms of climate change adaptation. However, our findings suggest that a shift to increased nocturnal hunting would be severely constrained in the African wild dog, because both moonlight and the need to guard pups during the denning period will remain fixed as temperatures rise. Consequently, wild dogs may not be behaviorally flexible enough to enable them to compensate sufficiently as temperatures continue to rise, contrasting with the pattern reported from other species, which have been observed shifting activity to cooler times and microclimates in response to higher temperatures (Hetem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2012</xref>; Cunningham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2015</xref>). These findings have clear implications for the future conservation of African wild dogs, as it may be necessary to focus conservation efforts on areas predicted to experience less warming in the future, for example, the southernmost parts of Africa or high altitude areas, to protect the species from extinction.
