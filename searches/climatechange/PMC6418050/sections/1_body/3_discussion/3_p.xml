<p id="Par30" class="p">In contrast with our conclusions, Creel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>) suggested that high ambient temperatures might benefit wild dogs. They reported that wild dog hunts entailed shorter chases at higher temperatures, attributing this pattern to large-bodied prey overheating before their smaller-bodied predators. Chases, however, have been found to make up only around 8% of the distance covered by wild dogs in Northern Botswana (Hubel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2016</xref>), a site where chase distances were significantly longer than those estimated for our study site (Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2007</xref>). The fact chases make up such a low percentage of distances covered by wild dogs would suggest that chases make up only a relatively small proportion of energy expenditure compared to searching for prey, similar to findings of studies into cheetah (
 <italic class="italic">Acinonyx jubatus</italic>) energetics (Scantlebury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2014</xref>). If daytime hunting were more efficient on hotter days, as suggested by Creel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>), there would be no need for the subsequently increased activity at night described here, and no reduction in reproductive success at high ambient temperatures, as described by Woodroffe et al. The difference between this study and that of Creel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>) may also reflect differences in the size of prey species [10 kg (main prey species dik-dik and impala), Woodroffe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2007</xref>, vs 88 kg mean mass (main prey species wildebeest and impala), Creel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>] and the more open habitat found in Creel et al’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>) study site that could potentially facilitate longer chases.
