<p class="p">As done successfully in the area of health communication, evidence-based communication should guide the presentation of climate information.

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), it is yet unclear how this affects cognitive outcomes such as understanding, credibility, and use of information. We believe that cognitive research could deliver the evidence needed to communicate climate information in a way that fosters understanding and informed decision-making. Future research should therefore develop and test communication guidelines based on cognitive process theories and with appropriate target audiences such as policy-makers. Understanding of climate information is not sufficient for grounded climate action; it is however, necessary.
