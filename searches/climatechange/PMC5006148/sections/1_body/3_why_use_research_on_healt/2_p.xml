<p class="p">However, decisions in the context of climate change may be considered more extreme than health decisions with respect to uncertainty, and decision impact. Decisions in the climate change context are characterized by large amounts of scientific uncertainty. This does not allow for unambiguous probability estimates (Amelung and Funke, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), even more so than in the medical field. With the communication of health/medical evidence, policy makers and the public have become accustomed to the concept of “significance.” This concept, however, can rarely be applied to climate science, further enhancing the difficulties associated with probabilistic evidence. The effects of climate change will only show decades or centuries later (Wigley, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), thereby also affecting future generations. The large time lags inherent in the climate system, and the large regional variability of its effects (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) also pose particularly strong motivational barriers to take action (Gifford, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Today's decision-makers will not be personally affected by the outcomes of their climate action—or inaction—, and they will not be held accountable for them, whereas decisions concerning health are typically characterized by stronger personal affection and accountability.
