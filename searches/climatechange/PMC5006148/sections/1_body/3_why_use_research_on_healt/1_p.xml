<p class="p">Communication on health, and climate information are similar on key aspects. First, similar to the topic of health, climate change is highly complex (Rind, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) due to an overwhelmingly large amount of information that grows and changes at a cognitively intractable pace. Second, both health, and climate information draw on probabilistic information that is difficult to grasp even for highly educated audiences. At the same time, probabilistic information can demonstrably be presented in ways that increase understanding (Hoffrage et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Third, similar to the health domain, critical action needs to be taken based on uncertain information (Should we invest in adaptation? Should we invest in reforestation? e.g., Canadell and Raupach, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lobell et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). This is why it needs to be ensured that the central, decision-relevant aspects of the information is conveyed. Lastly, the climate change, and the health domains share considerable overlap in that climate change is regarded as a large and increasing health threat (Sauerborn et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), enhancing problems of undernutrition, injury and disease due to heat waves, and infectious diseases (Sauerborn and Ebi, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Woodward et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Phalkey et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
