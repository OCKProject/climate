<p class="p">These extreme characteristics of climate decisions enhance the necessity of research on effective climate communication since the perceived necessity to act 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> is lower than in health. Several years ago, it was reasoned that health communication should be more successful (World Health Organization, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), especially at conveying complex messages (Freimuth and Quinn, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), and should no longer be based on researchers' intuition but rather on evidence about how the information is understood (Reyna, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). A substantial amount of evidence is now available showing how effective health communication can improve understanding, quality of decision-making, health behavior, and even health itself (for reviews, see Houts et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Coulter and Ellins, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Street et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). We believe that it is high time for evidence-based (instead of constraint-based) climate communication, and that cognitive psychology can and should deliver such evidence.
