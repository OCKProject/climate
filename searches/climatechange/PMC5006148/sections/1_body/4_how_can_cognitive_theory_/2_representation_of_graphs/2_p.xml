<p class="p">Interestingly, when it comes to communicating interactions, data may be better understood when explained via text rather than graphs (Parrott et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Fischer et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Fischer et al. found that if it is explicitly mentioned how different system elements interact (such as that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and absorptions jointly shape atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration), the understanding of the overall system behavior is increased, compared to the “same” information is depicted in a line graph.
