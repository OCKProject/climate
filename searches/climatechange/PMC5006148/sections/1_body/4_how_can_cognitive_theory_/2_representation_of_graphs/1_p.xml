<p class="p">IPCC graphs are full of detail. While this is understandable given the complexity of the topic, the wish to convey exhaustive information may exert paradoxical effects: recent meta-analyses and reviews on the communication of health information (Houts et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Zipkin et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) find that “simple” graphs that minimize distracting details are generally better understood, so that reducing the amount of information contained in a single graph might ironically lead to better-informed decision-makers. Moreover, similarly to the results on cognitive ease mentioned above, poor comprehension of graphs seems to be associated with the impression that the evidence is of poor quality and not persuasive (Ancker and Kaufman, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). This has important implications also for climate change communication: if the SPM's graphs fail in comprehensibility, their messages might lose credibility and be rejected altogether.
