<p class="p">A large body of research within the cognitive sciences shows that the way information is presented affects both understanding and the credibility of the information. Specifically, analytical processing of all factual details is not sufficient or sometimes even counterproductive for comprehension of uncertain and complex information (Kahneman, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Reyna, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Marx et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Highlighting the global patterns of dynamically complex systems such as the climate may lead to more accurate reasoning than a more analytical and detailed perspective (Fischer and Gonzalez, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Comprehension may also be improved when the presentation format highlights key points, and helps to reduce cognitive effort (Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Moreover, studies on the effects of experienced cognitive ease demonstrate that as the difficulty of processing information increases, its estimated credibility decreases (Oppenheimer, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Kahneman, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). This has the important implication that if readers of the SPMs experience reduced processing fluency, they may perceive the SPMs as less credible and trustworthy. In the following section, we provide some illustrations for our claim that cognitive theory and evidence could be used to enhance climate communication in the SPM's graphs and texts.
