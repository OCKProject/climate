<p class="p">Greenland plays a fundamental role in the Earth’s climate system with the physical location of an immense land mass capped by an ice sheet in the North Atlantic significantly influencing global atmospheric circulation. The large latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the World’s biggest island and the highly variable climatology cause strong spatial gradients in biotic and abiotic variables. Climate is the fundamental cause for this variability, thus its observation is fundamental for understanding current states as well as past and future changes of global relevance, from sea level rise to alterations in species composition.</p>
