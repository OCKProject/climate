<p class="p">Not least because of pronounced recent changes, a long-term ecosystem monitoring program (Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring, GEM) was initiated in 1995 (Meltofte and Thing 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1996</xref>) integrating all relevant components of the terrestrial and marine ecosystem at Zackenberg (ZAC). ZAC has since become a benchmark site for ecosystem studies in the high Arctic (Elberling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2008</xref>; Olesen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2010</xref>). Key findings of the process studies that have been carried out in the framework of the GEM include analyses of gas fluxes from the ground to the atmosphere (e.g., Mastepanov et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2008</xref>), and runoff, water chemistry and snow-cover studies (e.g., Christoffersen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>). These studies generally link the investigated process variable to climate as its driver. The climatology is well described in Hansen et al. (

 <italic class="italic">Ambio</italic>, several additional studies investigate a parameter’s trend or variability as well as the cause or consequence of a change in either. The records used in many studies that originate in the GEM effort date back to 1995 when the observation program was initiated and hence are temporally limited. An overarching and relevant question for many if not all of these studies is therefore the representativeness of the derived conclusions, which builds the main motivation for the present study. We tackle this question by (1) deriving climatological latitudinal air temperature and air pressure gradients along Greenland’s East and West coast, (2) comparing climate trends at ZAC with trends at other coastal sites for the period 1996–2014 and (3) comparing the trends derived in the time period 1996–2014 with other periods, where instrumental data exist.
