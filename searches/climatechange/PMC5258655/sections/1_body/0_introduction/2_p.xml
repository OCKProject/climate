<p class="p">Written records of atmospheric observations in Greenland date back to the early eighteenth century (van Loon and Rogers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">1978</xref>). Systematic instrumental observations started in the late eighteenth century on the West coast (Vinther et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2006</xref>), however, not before 1895 on the East coast (Box 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2002</xref>; Cappelen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2016a</xref>). Some additional climate-related studies were performed in the course of the 2nd International Polar year 1932/1933 (e.g., Laursen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1959</xref>) and later during the WWII (e.g., Ahlmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1942</xref>). A step forward in terms of establishment of new climate stations was the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), when several stations were established also in the remote Northeast Station Nord (STN), Danmarkshavn (DMH) and Daneborg (Hansen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2008</xref>). Until the 1990s, Greenland’s climate received rather little attention but recent dramatic changes in the ice sheet and ice caps and their potential use for paleo-climate information has increased the importance and therefore the number of studies considerably. Two recent studies investigated Greenland temperature changes in detail. (Hanna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>) found the most pronounced warming in West Greenland during winter; (Mernild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>) investigated both general temperature trends and also trends in extreme temperatures, and found different results for the East versus the West coast.
