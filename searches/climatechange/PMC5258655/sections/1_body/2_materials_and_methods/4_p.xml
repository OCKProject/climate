<p class="p">For trend detection, the non-parametric seasonal Mann–Kendall trend test (Hirsch and Slack 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">1984</xref>; Burkey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2006</xref>) is applied to the respective parameter. The choice for this test is made because of its robustness against non-normality, censoring and outliers. Trends are only shown, when they reject the test’s null-hypothesis of no linear trend at the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 significance level. All investigated trends are assessed on time series of daily means of which the seasonal Mann–Kendall test with months as the seasonal input is performed (Hirsch and Slack
