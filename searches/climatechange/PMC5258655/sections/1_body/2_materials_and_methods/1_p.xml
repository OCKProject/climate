<p class="p">The data we present in this study stem from various long-term monitoring initiatives. The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) has been running numerous AWS at various sites along Greenland’s coast and publishes the data annually (e.g., Cappelen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2016b</xref>). Originally, data were recorded every 3 h following the WMO policy of synoptic weather stations (SYNOP-stations). Since 1996, the stations in Greenland started with hourly observations (every whole hour UTC). A comprehensive quality control was applied to the whole dataset and erroneous data were removed (Boas and Wang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>), and the quality control has been continued since (Cappelen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2016a</xref>). An overview of the location of the AWS’s is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. We focus on air temperature and air pressure in this study as, for these variables, a point measurement can be interpreted as representative on a regional scale with more confidence than most other parameters measured on an AWS (i.e., precipitation, humidity, wind direction, wind speed). Air pressure is reduced to mean sea level. All AWS used lie below 100 m a.s.l. We restrict the dataset to the period where three or more stations with daily resolution are available. This limits the period with measured data to 1958–2014.
