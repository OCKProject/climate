<p class="p">Data gaps occur in the AWS data and their careful treatment is a key requirement for a reliable study. We apply the following criteria to determine temporal means: If more than 80 % of the hourly values exist, a daily mean is calculated. Likewise, monthly means are calculated if 80 % of the daily means exist and annual means are only included if all months are covered according to previous criteria. Furthermore, we only determine trends, when more than 95 % of the data in the respective time period are covered.</p>
