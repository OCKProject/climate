<p class="p">Apart from the stations DMI is operating, we use a climate dataset from ZAC. The set-up of the station deserves special description, it is designed to deliver high-quality data in an extreme Arctic environment in order to minimize data gaps. Two climate stations only about 25Â m apart measure the key atmospheric parameters concurrently using two separate data acquisition systems. Single time series for the individual parameters are calculated by combining data from the two stations. The way this is done is extensively described in Jensen et al. (
