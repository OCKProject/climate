<p class="p">Also in a temporal context, we found that warming during the monitoring period (1996–2014) has been slightly weaker than if the monitoring had started half a decade before. The consistency of this finding throughout all stations we investigated makes this an important and stable assumption and it is in line with the ‘warming hiatus’ that has been reported on a global scale for the past two decades (e.g., IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>). Recent studies, however, highlight the complexity of interpreting the global ‘hiatus’ signal and show very large uncertainties, especially for the Arctic (Karl et al.
