<p class="p">Observed climate trends in ZAC are in line with general Greenland climate trends but they are weaker than the statistically significant ones. This means that whenever biotic or abiotic changes in ZAC are attributed to climate drivers, changes may be even stronger in other areas of Greenland. It has to be noted, however, that ecosystem interaction and feedback mechanisms are highly nonlinear, which highlights the importance of coordinated and continued long-term ecosystem monitoring efforts and/or the use of proxy data in order to improve our spatial understanding.</p>
