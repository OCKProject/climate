<p class="p">The marked warming during February deserves attention and a more detailed investigation of its origin should be made. Since it is observed over large parts of the West coast, it is unlikely that changing sea ice conditions are the main trigger as we assume that the warming would then predominantly affect the stations where the sea ice change occurs. Since both regions with and without seasonal sea ice show this warming signal, we rather assume it is connected to changed atmospheric patterns, asymmetric changes in the north Atlantic oscillation or the Greenland blocking index (Hanna et al.
