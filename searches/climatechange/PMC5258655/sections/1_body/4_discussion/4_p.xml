<p class="p">Regarding the probable causes for the observed changes, the general atmospheric circulation (Overland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hanna et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>), changes in ocean currents and temperatures (e.g., Holland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>), altered atmospheric composition (Greenhouse Gases, humidity, aerosols; for example, Najafi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015</xref>) or clouds (van Tricht et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2016</xref>), and thus changes in the radiative balance do not reveal a complete list of potential factors. Furthermore, these are not independent from each other and feedback mechanisms occur (e.g., alteration in radiation balance due to a cryosphere/albedo feedback). An in-depth analysis of these drivers is beyond the scope of this article. We do, however, find evidence in the presented data that there is a link between changes in atmospheric circulation and the observed temperature trends. It is striking that positive pressure trends throughout varying time windows precede the strongest temperature warming by a few years, which is particularly the case in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is consistent with a more positive occurrence of the Greenlandic Blocking situation as recently highlighted by Hanna et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>). It is also worthwhile relating the land surface temperature trends presented in our study to general low-frequency variability of the climate system such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) (Schlesinger and Ramankutty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">1994</xref>). The late 1990s and early 2000s fall into a period of positive AMO-anomalies (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>) suggesting a coherent cause of both ocean and land temperature trends.
