<p class="p">When studying ecosystem changes and their drivers, it is crucial to understand the spatial representativeness of the study site. Air temperature and air pressure are spatially consistent enough to derive latitudinal gradients over a large study area as shown above. However, regarding the presented climatologies, there are some obvious local effects that influence the pattern. The abrupt changes in both air temperature and pressure patterns between STN and HKH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b, d) in the very Northeast of Greenland serve as an example of a local climatology deviating from the general latitudinal pattern despite them being only around 120 km apart. STN clearly shows a more continental climate, whereas HKH shows much weaker annual variations. These weaker annual variations at HKH are due to the location of the AWS on a small island and a persistent polynya called ‘Nordostvandet’ nearby (Cappelen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2001</xref>). Similar effects can be seen at the West coast near 69°N or in the very Southwest. In general, due to the distance between stations, our study does not resolve climate gradients that are due to local effects such as coastal influence or continentality, which in parts can cause strong climate gradients (e.g., Taurisano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2004</xref>; Abermann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2015</xref>). The exception being Southwest Greenland where the station density is higher.
