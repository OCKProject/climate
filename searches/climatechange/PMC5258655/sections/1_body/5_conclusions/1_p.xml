<p class="p">We find consistent latitudinal gradients of both air temperature and air pressure along the West and East coast of Greenland. Trend analysis of recent data shows that significant overall warming (up to 0.15 °C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the 1996–2014 period) has occurred which, on a monthly scale, was strongest in February at the West coast, but also notable during summer months both at the East and West coast. This strong warming exceeds periods of cooling between the 1950s and 1980s resulting in an overall temperature increase since 1950 at all stations with long-term data. The period with strongest warming was preceded by a period of significant pressure rise, possibly related to changes in the atmospheric circulation. A significant air pressure decrease in September is evident for the 1996–2014 period, which may be linked to delayed sea ice formation. This analysis could be expanded with the results of climate models or century-scale reanalysis data (e.g., ERA-20C, cf. Poli et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2016</xref>)) allowing for a longer analysis back in time and at higher spatial resolution. This would also assist in resolving local effects such as longitudinal gradients in continentality or topography. With a consistent dataset, this analysis could easily be expanded globally, helping to identify current and past hotspots of climate change.
