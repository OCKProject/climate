<p class="p">A good overview of Greenland’s climate is given in Cappelen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2001</xref>). The climate in East Greenland is determined by the East Greenland Current that flows along the coast from the Fram Strait down to Cape Farewell. It brings cold polar waters south that get gradually mixed with the warm North Atlantic Sea Current and transports vast amounts of ‘Storis’, the polar and first year sea ice formed further North. Seasonal sea ice cover generally reaches lower latitudes in the East than in the West of Greenland. In West Greenland, polar ice is practically absent apart from some ‘Storis’ in the very south transported from the East coast. Seasonal sea ice, however, occurs as far South as Disko Bay. Temperature gradients from south to north are a consequence of varying incident solar radiation with no polar night in the South and more than 4 months of polar night in the North.
