 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the mean monthly temperature for the stations along the West coast (a) and the East coast (c), respectively, for the period 1996–2014. The annual temperature cycle becomes generally more pronounced with increasing latitude. At the northernmost station (STN), the span between coldest monthly average and warmest monthly average is 33.6 °C, whereas the least pronounced range is found in the very southwest (NUN) with 8.9 °C difference between the warmest and the coldest month. The station density is higher along the West coast causing the apparently stronger heterogeneity in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a. When comparing the three coldest months, it is evident that differences along the West coast are considerably stronger (i.e., January tends to be 3–4 °C warmer than February and March North of 68°N). At all stations along the East coast, these three months are almost equally cold. The coldest month is February with a few exceptions, whereas the warmest month North of 70°N is July, further South it can also be August. The high station density in the very southwest causes a signal that is not dependent on latitude but rather caused by local climate. While latitudinal gradients are very strong during winter (on the order of &gt;1 °C per degree latitude), they are largely absent and likely smaller than local climatic variations during summer. Both along the West and the East coast, we identify areas with particularly strong latitudinal differences in temperature (i.e., between STN and HKH in the northeast or around 68°N or 62°N in the southwest).
