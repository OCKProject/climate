<p class="p">The other parameter that shows a clear latitudinal dependence is the atmospheric pressure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c, d) and although related to temperature in a latitudinal perspective (i.e., generally increasing pressure with latitude), the annual pressure variations are not consistent with the pattern of the annual temperature variations. Lowest pressure is generally in January at all stations and highest in May. In addition, in contrast to temperature, the annual pressure variations are more pronounced in the South than in the North. During winter, pressure increases with latitude by between 0.5 and 1 hPa per degree latitude with stronger gradients in the East. Summer months show a weak latitudinal dependence.
