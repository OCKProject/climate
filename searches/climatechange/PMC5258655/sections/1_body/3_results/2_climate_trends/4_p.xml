<p class="p">Fewer air pressure trends of significance have occurred both on the short and long time scale but some consistent patterns can be seen. There is a coherent period of negative air pressure trends in a 15â€“20-year period starting in the late 1970s which is present at all stations. Likewise, in the late 1980s and around 1990, a consistent positive air pressure trend is present. South Greenland is the area where both negative (NAR) and positive (QAQ) trends are most pronounced.</p>
