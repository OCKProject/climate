<p class="p">The seasonal Kendall slope estimator for the entire period (1996–2014) is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Only temperature trends are statistically significant for the entire period, whereas only individual months show significant air pressure trends. Statistically significant trends are between 0.05 and 0.15 °C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and highest values occur in the Northwest. The Sen’s slope of the seasonal Mann–Kendall trends has been derived for each month and statistically significant ones are displayed as a colour code for temperature trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, b) and pressure trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c, d). In terms of temperature trends, on a monthly basis we found some surprisingly coherent patterns. At several stations along the East and West coast, there is a consistent significant summer warming trend that occurs between June and September with the clearest signal in July. Values vary and are typically between 0.1 and 0.3 °C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Summer warming is strongest in Northwest Greenland and not significant in Southwest and Northeast Greenland North of ZAC. The summer warming trend is, however, exceeded by a notable warming during February which is evident at the majority of stations along the West coast but absent in East Greenland. The February warming is around double the strength of the summer warming in absolute values and has a maximum at NU1 (0.6 °C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). A cooling trend is only observed at four stations (ILU, UKI, PAA and QAQ) in April, at one station (UKI) in May and at one station (ILU) in December.
