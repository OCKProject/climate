<p class="p">In the above section, we have described temperature and pressure gradients and trends of the period 1996–2014. The data situation in Greenland allows for an assessment of how this period compares with other periods of the same length as well as how trends appear if a different time window had been chosen. The following figures can be interpreted as a visual look-up table and similar approaches have been used in other contexts by Liebmann et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>) and Olefs et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>). All available stations with daily data of more than 50 years were chosen and the same seasonal Mann–Kendall test applied. The colour code in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> depicts the air temperature (a–h) and air pressure (i–p) trend if a period of between 15 and 55 years (

 <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis). In case the null-hypothesis is rejected at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 significance level, the respective spot remains white. The order of the figures follows the long-term stations along the coast from West via South to Northeast Greenland. Regarding air temperature, the general pattern of the trends is similar. All stations but DMH show a significant cooling for window sizes of 15–20 years starting in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Then follows a period with no significant trends for the short window sizes. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, another cooling starts for the 15–25 year window sizes and is only present at the West coast sites. The most prominent feature regarding the shorter time windows is, however, the strong warming that peaks with a ca. 18-year period starting in the late 1980s (maximum at AAS 15 years starting 1989, 0.27 °C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). On a longer time scale, all stations show significant warming trends that get more pronounced the shorter and more recent the window size chosen. Very recent periods reveal a weakening of the warming trend. Comparing the stations with each other, it is clearly evident that both the short cooling periods and the strong recent warming are most pronounced at the West coast. While AAS is the hotspot for the warming, PAA showed the strongest cooling in the first phase. Overall, long-term warming is very similar at all stations.
