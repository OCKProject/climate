 <p class="p">Jean‐Michel Maes kindly made available his saturniid rearing records from Nicaragua. Grants from the Smithsonian Institution Barcoding Opportunity FY012 and FY013 and in‐kind help from the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding via Paul Hebert and Alex Borisenko at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario allowed the sequencing of many of the saturniid specimens collected recently on BCI. YB was supported by Czech Science foundation GAČR grant 14‐36098G. YB and HB are members of the Sistema Nacional de Investigación, SENACYT, Panama. GPAL was supported by an European Research Council Grant (No. 669609) during the writing of the paper. RR and TD acknowledge support from the FRB and CESAB Synthesis program through the ACTIAS research project.</p>
