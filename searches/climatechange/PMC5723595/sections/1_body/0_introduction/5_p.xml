<p class="p">In addition, species that share similar functional attributes (but not necessarily a common phylogeny) may have similar responses to climate fluctuations, and these responses may be more apparent and easy to interpret than when using a more traditional species‐specific approach (Pau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In temperate systems, functional categories have been used for Lepidoptera as relevant surrogates for life‐history changes induced by climatic shifts (Diamond, Frame, Martin, &amp; Buckley,

 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, in the tropics, where typically taxonomic impediment is high and knowledge of life histories extremely limited, species traits often are difficult to measure and are limited to a few taxa, such as butterflies or ants (Parr et al.,
