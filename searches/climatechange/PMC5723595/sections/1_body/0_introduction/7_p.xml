<p class="p">In recent years, climate fluctuations and anomalies have triggered changes in local community composition and dynamics in Panama and, particularly, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). More than 20 years ago, Condit, Hubbell, and Foster (

In particular, El Niño is responsible for variability in fruit production and famine among frugivorous animals (Wright, Carrasco, Calderón, &amp; Paton,
