<p class="p">In 2009, the ForestGEO (Forest Global Earth Observatory) Arthropod Initiative started long‐term monitoring among multiple contrasting taxa, including saturniid moths, within and near the permanent botanical plot of the Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) on BCI. The program aims to detect long‐term changes in the abundance and composition of focal arthropod assemblages, driven primarily by climatic fluctuations and anomalies, as opposed to short‐term stochastic changes (Anderson‐Teixeira et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Our present contribution reviews the minimum information necessary to discuss local saturniid assemblages in the tropics and relatively long‐term changes in their population dynamics, hence developing a framework onto which other recent time‐series of tropical arthropods may be similarly characterized and studied. Our main working hypotheses include the following: because Saturniidae are rather polyphagous (Bernays &amp; Janzen, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>), we would expect a limited effect of fluctuations in plant resources associated with climatic anomalies on their population dynamics, but perhaps not of temperature and of rainfall. The latter is known to affect caterpillar mortality in Panama (Caldas, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Hence, we contend that Saturniidae on BCI may be sensitive in the long‐term to local changes in rainfall rhythm and intensity and that the magnitude of these effects may be severe for species that are rather host specific (i.e., less polyphagous). In addition, we might expect small‐bodied moths to be more sensitive to climate fluctuations because of higher dispersal limitation than larger species. Finally, species exhibiting strong seasonality patterns might also be impacted by shifts in season magnitude and strength.
