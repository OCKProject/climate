<p class="p">Integrated monitoring of invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants may provide a complementary understanding of biodiversity changes in the face of global climate change (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Invertebrates are particularly sensitive to climate changes. For example, Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) reported that in Great Britain, the proportions of species declining in abundance over the last 20 years that can be directly attributed to climate change are 71%, 54%, and 28% for butterflies, birds, and vascular plants, respectively. Tropical insects often exhibit short generation times, as low as eight generations per year, with extremes to 10–14 generations for insect pests (Nair, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, arthropod monitoring during 5–10 years in the tropics may involve 40–80 overlapping insect generations and may be particularly useful for developing early warning systems, but that idea remains to be tested rigorously for a variety of insect taxa.
