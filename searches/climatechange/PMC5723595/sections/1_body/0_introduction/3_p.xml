<p class="p">Tropical insects may be extremely sensitive to local climate changes and anomalies for several reasons. First, the tropical regions, with their narrow annual temperature fluctuations, are thought to generate insect populations with higher and narrower thermal limits (Kaspari, Clay, Lucas, Yanoviak, &amp; Kay, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Projected air temperatures in the tropics approach the thermal limits of many insects over which muscular coordination may be disrupted or lost (Deutsch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Because insects are ectothermic organisms, they face limited tolerance to a warming world and hence hold greatest risks of extinction in the tropics (Deutsch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Kaspari et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Singer &amp; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Second, tropical insects are very sensitive to desiccation and therefore to extreme drought or rainfall events (Hood &amp; Tschinkel, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>; Singer &amp; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Wolda, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Finally, climate changes and anomalies may produce phenological mismatches between insect herbivores and plant resources, although this has been demonstrated mainly in temperate systems (Singer &amp; Parmesan,
