<p class="p">The specific objectives of this study were twofold. (1) To establish baseline data for assessing long‐term changes in saturniids on BCI, (a) providing a revised checklist of the saturniids of BCI, with most species being characterized by their DNA barcodes (Hebert, de Waard, &amp; Landry,

 <xref rid="ece33515-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">methods</xref>) and including older Panamanian records (1958–2016); (b) building a local phylogenetic tree for the saturniid species occurring on BCI; and (c) constructing a reproducible functional classification among the most common species using functional and ecological attributes describing dispersal ability, seasonality, and host specialization. Further, we will estimate total species richness on the island, discuss the composition of the saturniid assemblage, and test for independence between our functional classification and saturniid phylogeny. (2) To use the recent monitoring data to discuss possible changes in population trends for saturniids during the last eight years on BCI (2009–2016), by first, (a) testing for changes in annual species composition; (b) testing for significant population changes since 2009, either for species, higher taxa, or functional groups; (c) for the same datasets, testing for significant predictors of saturniid abundances during the study period; and finally, (d) evaluating which of the datasets (species, higher taxa, and functional groups) appear best suited to detect changes in population dynamics and interpret them. In sum, our study proposes a comprehensive framework for the study of long‐term monitoring of arthropods in tropical rainforests.
