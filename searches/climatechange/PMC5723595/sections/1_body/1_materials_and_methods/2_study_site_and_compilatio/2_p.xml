<p class="p">Barro Colorado Island (9.15°N, 79.85°W; 120–160 m asl) in Panama receives an average annual rainfall of 2,662 mm, with an annual average daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of 31.0°C and 23.6°C, respectively (

An air temperature increase of 2–5°C is projected for Panama by 2080 (Stocker, Qin, &amp; Platner, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Since 1981, BCI has experienced an increase of 0.36°C in mean annual temperature and 17.9% in mean annual precipitation (Anderson‐Teixeira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). During the study period, annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures rose slightly, especially since 2011 (Fig. S1). For example, the annual maximum temperature of 2016 was 0.6°C higher than that of the base year, 2009. However, annual rainfall did not appear to increase during the study period (Fig.S1). A detailed description of the setting and climatic data for the 50 ha CTFS plot, which is located in the center of the island, may be found in Windsor (

Cerro Barro Colorado, cut off from the mainland by the rising water, became a 1,542 ha island (M. Solano pers. comm.). The island is entirely covered by lowland tropical forest with some anthropogenic clearings, locations of Smithsonian facilities.
