<p class="p">We used eight datasets to compile records of Saturniidae collected or observed on BCI (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33515-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) and verified saturniid taxonomy with Rougerie (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The datasets represent a mix of published lists, online databases, and rearing and monitoring projects (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33515-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The total 1,601 records are distributed from 1958 to 2016, but we will also refer later to the survey by Dyar (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1914</xref>), predating the formation of BCI. The ForestGEO Arthropod Initiative used a light trap protocol to attract Saturniidae with traps set at 10 locations and run for four surveys each year (640 night samples; methods in Lucas, Forero, &amp; Basset, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; and Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece33515-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). These surveys were performed with a weighted frequency of dry/wet periods, so that annual moth population indices reflected well the whole year: dry period, ca January to April, one survey in March; wet period, ca May to December, three surveys in May, September, and November. Further and as far as possible, the May survey was performed 3 weeks after the official start of the wet season as reported by The Panama Canal Authority (data courtesy of The Panama Canal Authority; the average date of wet season onset is 4 May [1954–2016]).
