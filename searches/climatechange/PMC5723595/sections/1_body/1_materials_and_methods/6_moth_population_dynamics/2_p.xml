<p class="p">To analyze recent population trends, we fitted to each species sufficiently well sampled (i.e., probability to have collected at least one individual per survey each of the 8 study years, total of individuals collected &gt;32, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14 species) three different time‐series models (log‐linear Poisson regression models) with the software TRIM (Pannekoek &amp; van Strien, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), using a matrix of species abundance at each location (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10) and year (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8). The models included the following: (1) no time‐effects: counts vary only across sites and not across time points; (2) linear trend: model with a site‐effect and a linear (on the log scale) effect of time; and (3) model with separate parameters for each time point. For models (2) and (3), TRIM calculates a multiplicative slope, which corresponds to the yearly change and is converted into one of the following categories: strong or moderate increase, stable, uncertain, moderate, and steep decline (Pannekoek &amp; van Strien,

 <xref rid="ece33515-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Goodness of fit of the models was assessed with chi‐square tests, and the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion score (AIC) was selected. We ran TRIM models for the most common species, for higher taxa together (saturniid family and subfamilies), and for functional groups as delineated by our cluster analysis.
