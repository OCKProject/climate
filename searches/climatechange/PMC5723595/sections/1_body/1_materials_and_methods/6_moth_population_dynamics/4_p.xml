<p class="p">To sum up these various analyses, the TRIM models aimed to test whether, (1) changes in abundance were similar in all spatially replicated locations (and therefore more likely to reflect real population changes as opposed to changes related to the conditions of the surveys); and (2) significant increase or decrease in abundance existed, compared to the base year, 2009. On the other hand, multiple regressions and the CCA aimed at testing the relative influence of climatic variables on changes in moth abundance and species composition, respectively. Finally, the ARIMA models attempted to forecast two future years of data according to the structure of our existing data.</p>
