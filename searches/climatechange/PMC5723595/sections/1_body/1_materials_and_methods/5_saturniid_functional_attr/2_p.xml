<p class="p">We first used a combination of morphological traits to estimate the ability of a species to disperse (Sekar, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and to shift to different habitats in a changing environment (Diamond et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Slade et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We measured forewing length (FW) and thorax width (TW) for each species and calculated the ratio of TW to FW as an index of flight strength (Wing load). We then build an index of seasonality representing the variance around the peak of maximum abundance of each species per year (hereafter Var_Peak), over the 8 years of monitoring (Lamarre, Mendoza, Fine, &amp; Baraloto, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). A low variance around the peak of maximum abundance denotes a narrow peak of abundance and a strong annual seasonality. Note that quarterly surveys within years allow only a minimal resolution in the estimate of seasonality, but are enough to identify dry or wet season specialists. We also estimated an index of relative host specialization for each taxon (DBIF) as the proportion of host plant families used by the species relative to the total number of host plant families recorded in the database. A small diet index indicates high specialization for saturniid species feeding on fewer host plant families. Calculations of these variables are detailed in Appendix
