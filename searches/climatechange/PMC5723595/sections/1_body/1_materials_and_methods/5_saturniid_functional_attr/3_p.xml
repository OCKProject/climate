<p class="p">We were able to quantify functional attributes for 41 species and create a matrix of species × functional traits that included five variables: FW, TW, Wing load, Var_Peak, and DBIF (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece33515-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). We used this matrix to compute a principal component analysis (PCA). The different components (axes) of the PCA were used as combinations of traits to define a Euclidean functional space with reduced uncorrelated dimensions, where each species was represented according to its PCA scores. This approach is recognized as an efficient way to produce high‐quality functional spaces (Maire, Grenouillet, Brosse, &amp; Villéger, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We then computed a functional tree using hierarchical daisy clustering methods based on functional clusters defined by the species scores on all axes. Further details on these analyses are indicated in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece33515-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that this trait‐based approach represented a functional classification that was independent of moth phylogeny. We mapped each of our clustered functional groups onto the community phylogeny and calculated the mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) between all members of the same cluster. These mean values were compared to randomized distributions as generated by 999 tip label permutations; a two‐tailed test was used to assess the probability that mean values fell outside of either tail of the randomized distribution. Further details and software used for these analyses may be consulted in Appendix
