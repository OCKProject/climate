<p class="p">The ForestGEO data identifications relied on both morphological and molecular data. Of 1,274 specimens collected in light traps, we pinned and retained 646 specimens (i.e., 51%). The remainder was discarded after identification. First, specimens were identified morphologically using Janzen and Hallwachs (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and using more specific publications and expert opinion when needed (RR, TD). Second, DNA Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI, “DNA barcode”) sequences were processed from the ForestGEO pinned specimens at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph, using methods described in Wilson (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In total, we obtained 167 sequences. Molecular data were used to confirm identifications based on morphology and to examine the possibility that morphological uniformity might conceal cryptic species. All species delineated by molecular data are unambiguously referred to by their Barcode Index Number (BIN), which can be used as a proxy taxonomic unit (Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Morphospecies not yet formally described but with distinct BINs are termed “cryptic” species, even if in some cases they can be distinguished morphologically from other species. See Appendix
