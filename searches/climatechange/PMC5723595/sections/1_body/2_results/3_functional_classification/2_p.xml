<p class="p">Saturniid species that share life‐history traits related to dispersal, annual seasonality, and host plant specialization were clustered into five distinct functional groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Saturniid species in Cluster #1 and #5 are best‐represented by large body‐size species (i.e., high dispersal ability) showing a high annual seasonality (i.e., species that showed convergent monthly peaks of abundance over the 8‐year study period) and to a lesser extent high host specialization (specialists; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Table S4). Species grouped in Cluster #5 were among the most specialized saturniids on BCI (see Fig.S3, axis3). Cluster #2 is composed by small‐ to medium‐size Hemileucinae (i.e., dispersal limitation) presenting a low annual seasonality and the most host generalist species. We recorded the use of 45 distinct host plant families by 
 <italic class="italic">Hylesia continua</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Automeris banus</italic> (Cluster #2, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). A group of species in Hemileucinae and Oxyteninae form Cluster #3, including host specialist species with potentially high dispersal limitation due to their small body‐size. Species of Oxyteninae were the most host specialized saturniids in our collection with no more than two host plant families recorded. Finally, species grouped in Cluster #4 are relatively aseasonal and have a very low degree of host specificity (Table S4). Overall, our functional classification best interpreted by the Euclidian functional space (Fig.S3) distinguished in Axis 1 the species with large body‐size (dispersal ability) and seasonal pattern versus smaller body size (dispersal limitation) showing aseasonal patterns (Cluster #1 and #5 vs. Cluster 2#3#4). In addition, axes 2 and 3 separated species showing higher host specificity (Clusters #3, #5) from species that were more host generalists (Clusters #1, #2). Two of the five functional groups (Clusters #2 and #5) represented clustered subsets of the saturniid community phylogeny, while one was marginally significant (Cluster #1; Table S4, Fig. S4).
