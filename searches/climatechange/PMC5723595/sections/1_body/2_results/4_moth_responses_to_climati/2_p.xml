<p class="p">No significant TRIM model could be fitted to the time‐series of all specimens of Saturniidae (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33515-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), hardly surprising as most species had different population trends during 2009‐2016. Of the 14 species that could be tested, three could not be fitted to any of the TRIM models (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33515-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Fig.S5). Two species (14% of species tested) showed a significant increase over time, namely 
 <italic class="italic">Hylesia praedpichinchensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Automeris vanschaycki</italic>. The rest of the species (64%) showed significant effects for each time point but the direction of the change was uncertain. Six species showed a clear peak in abundance in 2011, four species in 2016, three species in 2015, and this was reflected when all specimens of Saturniidae were considered together. Whereas TRIM models could be fitted to only one (Oxyteninae) of five saturniid subfamilies, they could be fitted to two of five functional groups. For functional Cluster #2, the direction of change was uncertain, whereas functional Cluster #5 showed a significant increase in time (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33515-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Fig. S4). The multiplicative slope estimate calculated by TRIM for the 11 species with significant models could be explained by a weak but significant multiple regression explaining 42.3% of the variance: slope = 0.666 + 0.006 × forewing length + 0.162 × Var_Peak (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2,8 </sub>= 4.66, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .046), in which forewing length had a large and positive standard coefficient.
