<p class="p">Six climatic variables (Table S1) explained 39.9% of variance in faunal composition among surveys in the CCA (test for significance of all axes, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 2.8, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .002; Fig.S6). The sum of degree‐days during the 30 preceding days of the survey best explained the formation of the first Axis of the CCA. Soil humidity explained best the formation of the second axis. The average minimal temperature during the 15 days preceding the survey and the average moonlight during the survey was best correlated with axes 3 and 4, respectively. Interestingly, climatic variables with a time lag prior to the survey were more likely to explain the variance in faunistic composition than variables related to the climatic conditions of the survey, but we acknowledge the possible influence of moonlight in this context.
