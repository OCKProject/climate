<p class="p">ARIMA models predicted seasonal peaks for 2017 and 2018 (as expected), but never of the magnitude of years 2011, 2015, or 2016 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Fig.S5). More than half of models (54%) predicted seasonal peaks larger than those of the 2009 base year. Only two of the 24 time‐series tested presented some degree of autocorrelation. Although stepwise regressions accounted for 20%–75% (average 45%) of the variance in log abundance of saturniids per survey, they were not accurate enough to predict the peaks in abundance of year 2011, 2015, and 2016 for many taxa (Table S5, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Fig.S5). Overall, climatic variables accounting for time lags or reflecting conditions during the month of the survey were better predictors of saturniid abundance than variables relevant to the day of the survey (Table S5). One of the most consistent predictors of saturniid abundance was the accumulation of degree‐days during the 30 days preceding the survey (Table S5, best predictor in 54% of regressions, positive coefficient in most cases). Similarly, the average minimal air temperature during the 30 days preceding the survey was also a good predictor of saturniid abundance (negative coefficient in all cases). The sum of rainfall during the month of the survey was also a relatively good predictor, but its influence on saturniid abundance could be either positive or negative, depending on the cases. We also note that soil humidity and solar radiation for the month of the survey contributed positively and negatively to saturniid abundance, respectively, and were possible surrogates for vegetation growth. In contrast, the influence of the monthly ENSO index was not obvious.
