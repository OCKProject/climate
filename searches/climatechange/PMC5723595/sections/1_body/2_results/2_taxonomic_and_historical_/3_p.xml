<p class="p">We were able to obtain at least five DNA sequences for most saturniid species, which were well delineated by DNA barcodes (average normalized divergence within species 0.09%, Table S2). In the ForestGEO dataset, saturniid genera were delineated by at least 9.5% of divergence (Table S2). We recovered phylogenetic hypotheses in general agreement with published studies (Regier et al.,
