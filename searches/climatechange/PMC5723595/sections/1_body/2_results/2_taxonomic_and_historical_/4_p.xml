<p class="p">The NDMS analysis clearly separated recent monitoring years (2009‐2016) from older datasets (Dyar and Blest) and rearing records (Aiello; inset of Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The NDMS also clearly separated ForestGEO monitoring years, with the most dissimilar pairs of years being 2010‐2011 and 2014‐2015 (main Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Axis 1 of the ordination was correlated with the total number of individuals collected each year (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .846, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .008), with Years 2011, 2015, and 2016 yielding high numbers of catches. Axis 2 of the ordination was correlated with the coefficient of variation of abundance in each subfamily for each year (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .905, 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>= .002), with, for example, a high proportion of Hemileucinae collected in Years 2014 and 2011, relative to the overall total of specimens trapped per year (main Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33515-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We also note that the lowest overall faunal similarity was between a pre‐El Niño year (2014) and an El Niño year (2015, Table S3).
