<p class="p">Altogether, we recorded 72 species of saturniids on BCI for the period 1958 to 2016 (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece33515-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), representing ca. 60% of the currently estimated diversity of saturniid species in Panama. Most species were named (88.9%) and had valid BINs (80.6%), including 6.9% of cryptic species, 56.9% of species with sequences originating from BCI, and 43.1% of species with sequences originating from other tropical sites.

The accumulation of singletons for the ForestGEO light trap data suggests that at least 44.1 ± 0.01 species (ICE ± SD) may be collected by light traps on BCI (Fig.S2a). However, four cryptic species were discovered after sequencing 167 individuals. The best‐fit model between the cumulative number of individuals sequenced and the cumulative number of cryptic species discovered was a reciprocal logarithm model, suggesting that many more cryptic species remain to be discovered on BCI, with accrued numbers of specimens being sequenced (Fig.S2b).
