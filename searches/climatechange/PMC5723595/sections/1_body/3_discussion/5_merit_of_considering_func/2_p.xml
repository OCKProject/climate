<p class="p">As compared with other insect groups, Saturniidae overall appear rather homogeneous as far as life history is concerned, because they are almost all relatively polyphagous as larvae and short‐lived as adults. However, our study showed that they display contrasting functional attributes and that functional groups may exhibit different time‐series, possibly related to climate changes or extreme events. For example, functional Cluster # 5 included large species with good dispersal ability, relative host specificity, and seasonality, and those species collectively showed a significant and moderate increase over time, as compared to the 2009 base year. This pattern is also demonstrated by the positive relationship between the multiplicative slope calculated by TRIM models, related to an increase in population abundance, and forewing length. Hence, we conjecture that the saturniid population increase expected in future years, as discussed in the previous section, would be reflected primarily by species included in functional Cluster # 5, a result suggesting that rising air temperature may more directly affect larger species. It would also support our prediction that the effect of climate fluctuation on species restricted to a smaller set of host plants (i.e., specialist) might be stronger. However, we found little support for direct effects of rainfall on small dispersal‐limited saturniid species such as functional Clusters #2 and #3.</p>
