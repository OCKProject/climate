<p class="p">Adult saturniids do not feed, have short life spans (often 4 to 14 days), and, particularly for the heavy‐bodied species, are unable to fly until they first have raised the temperature of their thoracic muscles to 35°C by a period of “shivering” (Blest, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1960a</xref>). For saturniids, rising air temperatures may mean allocating less time to shivering and more time available for mating partners and searching for suitable oviposition sites and may represent a significant advantage for species with particularly short adult life spans (Janzen, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984b</xref>). We speculate that it may represent the basis for explaining the positive effect of rising air temperature on certain saturniid species, as observed for the time‐series of species included in functional Cluster # 5.
