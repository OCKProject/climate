<p class="p">TRIM models were significant for 79% of species tested, 40% of functional groups, and 20% of higher taxonomic groups (subfamilies). The average percentages of variance explained in multiple regressions were also 43%, 54%, and 49% among species, functional groups, and subfamilies, respectively. Unquestionably, time‐series should be analyzed at the species level for an optimal interpretation of observed patterns. However, we imperatively need strategies to summarize these patterns conveniently when confronted with diverse groups such as insects. Our results suggest that the use of functional groups over taxonomic categories complement and improve our ability to interpret results, even for groups as ecologically homogeneous as the Saturniidae. Further, species traits that we compiled for each saturniid species are rather preliminary, as compared to those used for tropical ants (Parr et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Improved species traits may result in improved resolution of functional groups. Our basic analysis of phylogenetic clustering revealed that the functional groups that were most suitable for time‐series analysis were also clustered across the community phylogeny. It is likely that groups, that share a close common ancestry, present uniform responses to environmental changes driven by physiological conservatism.
