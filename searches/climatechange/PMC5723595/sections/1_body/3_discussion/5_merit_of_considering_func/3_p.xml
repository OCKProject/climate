<p class="p">Species from cluster #5 likely have many common traits due to shared ancestry (with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">Automeris vanschaycki</italic>), suggesting also that the subfamily Arsenurinae as a whole may be a useful source of indicator species. They cannot be considered as fully phylogenetically independent in their climactic response, as the traits explaining this response maybe correlated between species. It is possible that a trait correlated with body size is the main driver of their response to climate. However, our analysis also identified that the slope of increase in abundance in TRIM models was also correlated primarily with forewing length. We suggest that we have isolated one of the key traits for predicting population increases: body size, with the added advantage that taxonomy may be used to select further indicator species, but acknowledge that wider sampling may help test the generality of this conclusion.
