<p class="p">The time‐series for most saturniid species tested showed significant effects for each time point. However, the often‐abrupt yearly changes in abundance for these species precluded establishing the direction of change. Yet many species were more abundant in 2016 as compared to the 2009 base year, and ARIMA forecasts for the next two years suggest that this pattern will hold for many species. The populations of only two species,

 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), and the present observation may be related to this ability. Our simple models based on stepwise multiple regressions with climatic variables were able to some extent to predict saturniid abundance, but they could be improved using synthetic climatic variables and other variables accounting for biotic factors. Unfortunately, to date, there is no index of vegetation phenology that can be suitable at the community level for BCI (S.J. Wright pers. comm.). Our regressions suggest that in many cases, the accumulation of degree‐days during the 30 days preceding the survey was a relevant and positive predictor of saturniid abundance. The influence of rainfall in this respect was more equivocal. Hence, we expect that the current increase in air temperature observed on BCI (Anderson‐Teixeira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) will lead to an overall increase in many saturniid species in the long‐term, all other things being equal.
