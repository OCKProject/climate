<p class="p">The accumulation curve for the ForestGEO light trap data suggests that the saturniid fauna has been relatively well sampled as at least 44 species were present at the fixed locations where the traps were running. With respect to estimating the local species pool on BCI, this finding is misleading for at least two reasons. First, our collection refers only to the shady understorey of the forest, where attraction of saturniids to light is probably &lt;50 m (Beck &amp; Linsenmaier, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Moving the ForestGEO light traps to other locations on BCI may increase the number of species collected, as suggested by the list of the 72 species recorded altogether on the island. Second, accumulation of cryptic species is strongly dependent on the number of specimens sequenced, and we were able to sequence only a small proportion of the material collected by ForestGEO light traps (13%). The present saturniid list for BCI currently includes only four cryptic species (6% of the total), including one species that was common enough to be well monitored during the period 2009–2016. Janzen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), after sequencing a massive 48,000 + saturniid specimens from Guanacaste (Costa Rica), showed that the proportion of cryptic species was 40%. Therefore, a species pool of 60 + breeding species on BCI looks plausible.
