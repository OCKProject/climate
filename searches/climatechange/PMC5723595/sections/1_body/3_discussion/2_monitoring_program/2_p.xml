<p class="p">Light traps represent a relatively easy and convenient way to collect Saturniidae in tropical rainforests (Lamas, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). However, light trap catches are heavily biased toward males (83% of individuals in the ForestGEO data) that are actively seeking females. This may or may not impede sound interpretation of the data, depending on the objectives of the study. For the purpose of long‐term monitoring, this appears not to be problematic. More questionable for saturniid surveys is the low efficiency of automatic bucket traps to collect the largest species, such as
