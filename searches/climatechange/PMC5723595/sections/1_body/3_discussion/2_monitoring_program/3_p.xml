<p class="p">It is also well known that light traps measure the density in flight activity for moths, dependent on air temperature, humidity, moonlight, etc., which may not necessarily be correlated with actual population abundance (Muirhead‐Thomson, 
 <xref rid="ece33515-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). In our study, we note that climatic variables explaining the abundance of saturniids within surveys rarely included variables related to the dates of light trapping but, rather, variables with time lags of 30 days. This suggests that our data reflect real changes in population dynamics rather than mere changes in moth activity, an idea clearly supported by the high number of species tested whose time‐series could be fitted with TRIM models accounting for the effects of time at each location. This effect would have been less obvious if species abundances were entirely dependent on local trap conditions (e.g., effect of background trap illumination in the forest) and in turn more likely to vary differently among sampling locations. Further, the four surveys performed per year with a weighted frequency of dry/wet periods represented a good compromise between sampling effort and precision in measuring fluctuations in moth abundances and allowed us to derive representative moth population indices for the whole year, accounting for seasonal effects (Basset et al.,
