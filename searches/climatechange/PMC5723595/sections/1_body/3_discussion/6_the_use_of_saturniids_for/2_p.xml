<p class="p">Most of the rather large saturniid moths are charismatic and may be appreciated by the public; their taxonomy is relatively well advanced, they are easily collected by automatic bucket light traps, local species pools are probably often &lt;100 species, and a few common species are amenable to statistical analysis of long‐term population trends, as shown in this study. The largest species cannot be collected easily with the trap model that we used, but this is not necessarily a strong limitation. The biology of saturniids also is interesting with regard to monitoring, as discussed previously. Overall, these various attributes appear rather positive to recommend saturniids as model taxa for studying the long‐term effects of climate change on tropical insects. However, the relative sensitivity of saturniid species to climate change in the long‐term is unknown and may be appreciated only when comparing saturniid time‐series to those of contrasting tropical insects popular in the conservation literature, such as butterflies, bees, and ants. We will discuss this issue elsewhere, as the ForestGEO monitoring data accumulated for BCI are ideally suited for that.</p>
