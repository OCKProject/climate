   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). The model was fitted to five imputed datasets using multinomial logistic regression. The mean null deviance = 965.6, the degrees of freedom for the null model = 1400, the mean residual deviance = 954.3, and the residual degrees of freedom = 1396. The model fits the data significantly better than the null model (p = 0.024).
