<p class="p">Other factors may contribute to the explanation of the differences between the results in [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and the results presented in this study. It is possible that the combined measure of scientific literacy and numeracy that Kahan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] construct is not useful for predicting differences between people with different educational levels. Additionally, the methods used in our study account for particularities associated with the analysis of data on individual scales of measurement; Kahan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] assumed that the data fell on an interval scale to justify the use of linear regression methodology. Thus, in [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] the use of linear regression methodology on rating scale and count data might have significantly affected the results.
