<p class="p">The results show that the dynamics between valuations, educational level, and risk perception predicted by CCT are not at work in the domain investigated in this study. While this result is far from a refutation of the CCT as such, it does show that the CCT has no explanatory power in connection with the climate change responses among forest owners in Sweden and Germany. Furthermore, it provides information that is valuable in its own right in that it helps for understanding forest owner climate change response.</p>
