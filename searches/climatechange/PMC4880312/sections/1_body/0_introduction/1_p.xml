<p class="p">Do forest owners' levels of education or value profiles explain their responses to climate change? The cultural theory of risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and its recent offspring, the cultural cognition thesis (CCT) [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] have challenged the familiar and much discussed "knowledge deficit" model (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]) in which scientific education plays an important role in fostering understanding in people who can learn about and adapt their decision-making to new information, including information about changing climate. Scientific literacy and numeracy are positively correlated with education level [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; thus, it is plausible that the CCT might explain part of the dynamics of education level and value profile impact on forest owners' responses to climate change. According to CCT an individual's beliefs will converge with those of people with whom he or she shares common values. One implication of CCT is consistent with the claims of [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], which reports that people with a lower education level perceive higher risk than those with a higher education level. However, this depends on whether the situation is "pathological" [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The CCT claims that in "pathological" situations complex psychological mechanisms reflecting the segment of the public to which an individual belongs make him or her adopt interpretations of scientific evidence and perceptions of risk that fit the world view he or she has [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Science-literate individuals often become more culturally polarized because they have the specific capacity to search out and interpret evidence in patterns that sustain the convergence between their risk perceptions and their group identities [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In this paper we assess this application of CCT. In particular, we ask whether, under certain circumstances at least, climate change risk is indeed perceived to be higher by forest owners with lower levels of educational attainment (specifically, more limited scientific literacy and numeracy) than it is by forest owners with higher education levels. We expect to find that the influence of the cultural and other values of individuals on this relationship is statistically significant. If the psychological mechanisms identified by CCT operate among forest owners, we should observe polarizing differences in risk perception between groups of people with different value profiles. However, CCT claims that polarization occurs only in people with certain cultural values, and that the mechanisms are salient only in certain "pathological" [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] situations. Hence in what follows our findings relate to the applicability of CCT to forest owners specifically, not CCT as such. Notwithstanding that people also learn from sources in their environment, the knowledge deficit model suggests that education plays an important role in equipping people to address predicaments like climate change.
