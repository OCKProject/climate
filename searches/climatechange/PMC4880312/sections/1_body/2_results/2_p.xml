<p class="p">Strength of belief in having experienced the effects of climate change was correlated with university education for German but not Swedish respondents (

 <xref rid="pone.0155137.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>). This component of the perception of climate-change risk was correlated with the value profiles for respondents in Sweden (
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Swedish respondents with any value profile except "Forest user" reported that they had not experienced the effects of climate change (i.e. a response of "Probably not") significantly more often than those with the "Forest user" value profile (
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The "Forest user" value profile is driven primarily by self-sufficiency (
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), which indicates that those in this group spend considerable amounts of time in the forest, a finding that provides a non-value-based explanation of the observed difference.
