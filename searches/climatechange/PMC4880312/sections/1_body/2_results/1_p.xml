<p class="p">In neither of the two countries was university education found to reduce the perception of risk from climate change (

 <xref rid="pone.0155137.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>). Indeed in most cases university education increased the perception of risk. Even more importantly, the effect of university education was not dependent on the individuals' value profile. The perception of risk in terms of the strength of belief in the local effects of climate change was higher for Swedish and German respondents with university education than for those without (Tables
