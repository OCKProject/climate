 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] was used to test for differences between groups of data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155137.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Preferences for services and benefits were reported on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 denoting no value and 10 denoting the highest value (with missing data for individual questions interpreted as 0). In valuations of this kind, respondents are known to use scales of measurement that often are non-linear and that differ between individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The individuals' valuations for each country were optimally scaled to maximize the sum of the largest eigenvalues [
 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] for each country (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s008" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>), the number of which was determined using scree plots. The optimally scaled transformations (&gt;0) were then used for each country to co-cluster the benefits, services and respondents using the machine-learning technique of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999), to identify clusters of value items and show how the forest owners' preferences were loaded on these (

 <xref rid="pone.0155137.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]). To enable consideration of different value strengths, the individuals’ loadings on the identified clusters of values were used to cluster private forest owners for each country into groups representing different value profiles using the Affinity Propagation Clustering methodology [
