The cultural cognition thesis (CCT) has cast serious doubt on the familiar and often criticized "knowledge deficit" model, which says that laypeople are less concerned about climate change because they lack scientific knowledge. Advocates of CCT maintain that citizens with the highest degrees of scientific literacy and numeracy are not the most concerned about climate change. Rather, this is the group in which cultural polarization is greatest, and thus individuals with more limited scientific literacy and numeracy are more concerned about climate change under certain circumstances than those with higher scientific literacy and numeracy. The CCT predicts that cultural and other values will trump the positive effects of education on some forest owners' attitudes to climate change. Here, using survey data collected in 2010 from 766 private forest owners in Sweden and Germany, we provide the first evidence that perceptions of climate change risk are uncorrelated with, or sometimes positively correlated with, education level and can be explained without reference to cultural or other values. We conclude that the recent claim that advanced scientific literacy and numeracy polarizes perceptions of climate change risk is unsupported by the forest owner data. In neither of the two countries was university education found to reduce the perception of risk from climate change. Indeed in most cases university education increased the perception of risk. Even more importantly, the effect of university education was not dependent on the individuals' value profile.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>EU 7th framework programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>226544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanewinkel</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Mistra</institution></funding-source><award-id>Mistra-SWECIA</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>M14-0138:1</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsr&#x000e5;det Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lund University Centre of Excellence for Integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the EU project MOTIVE ("Models for adaptive forest management", grant 226544) (Motive-project.net) to KB, EP and MH and the foundation for strategic environmental research programme Mistra-SWECIA to KB.

The cultural theory of risk [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and its recent offspring, the cultural cognition thesis (CCT) [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have challenged the familiar and much discussed "knowledge deficit" model (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) in which scientific education plays an important role in fostering understanding in people who can learn about and adapt their decision-making to new information, including information about changing climate. Scientific literacy and numeracy are positively correlated with education level [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; thus, it is plausible that the CCT might explain part of the dynamics of education level and value profile impact on forest owners' responses to climate change. According to CCT an individual's beliefs will converge with those of people with whom he or she shares common values. One implication of CCT is consistent with the claims of [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which reports that people with a lower education level perceive higher risk than those with a higher education level. However, this depends on whether the situation is "pathological" [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The CCT claims that in "pathological" situations complex psychological mechanisms reflecting the segment of the public to which an individual belongs make him or her adopt interpretations of scientific evidence and perceptions of risk that fit the world view he or she has [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Science-literate individuals often become more culturally polarized because they have the specific capacity to search out and interpret evidence in patterns that sustain the convergence between their risk perceptions and their group identities [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this paper we assess this application of CCT. In particular, we ask whether, under certain circumstances at least, climate change risk is indeed perceived to be higher by forest owners with lower levels of educational attainment (specifically, more limited scientific literacy and numeracy) than it is by forest owners with higher education levels. We expect to find that the influence of the cultural and other values of individuals on this relationship is statistically significant. If the psychological mechanisms identified by CCT operate among forest owners, we should observe polarizing differences in risk perception between groups of people with different value profiles. However, CCT claims that polarization occurs only in people with certain cultural values, and that the mechanisms are salient only in certain "pathological" [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] situations. Hence in what follows our findings relate to the applicability of CCT to forest owners specifically, not CCT as such. Notwithstanding that people also learn from sources in their environment, the knowledge deficit model suggests that education plays an important role in equipping people to address predicaments like climate change.</p><p>Forests are directly exposed to, and dependent on, the climate. Thus, forest owners who assign value to their forests and therefore have a stake in climate change are likely to be highly sensitive to the issue of climate change. Previous research has found that Swedish and German forest owners' perceptions of the risks posed by climate change differ widely, and that the variation can be explained almost completely by individual experiences of the effects of climate change and the strength of an individual's belief in local climate change effects [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other studies support the significance of these two factors in perceptions of climate change risk [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have found that they are interdependent [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Thus, in order to study the dynamics of the impact of education level and value profile on forest owners' responses to climate change, and in an attempt to test the applicability of the CCT to these dynamics, we designed a questionnaire study to assess preferences for various services and benefits provided by the participant's forest, perceptions of climate change risk, and education level among private forest owners in Sweden and Germany. The countries were chosen so as to include forest owners operating in different economic, social, political and cultural structures in Europe. The reported strengths of belief in the local effects of climate change and personal experience of the effects of climate change were used as measures of perceived risk from climate change [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; and reported levels of educational attainment were used to divide respondents into those who had, and those who had not, studied at university, thus mimicking high and low levels of scientific literacy and numeracy, respectively. Although the correlation between science literacy and numeracy and educational level is not perfect, this positive correlation is well established (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The data obtained were used to test the hypothesis that under certain circumstances the forest owner's perception of risk from climate change correlates negatively with educational level and depends on valuations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We designed a questionnaire study to assess the preferences for services and benefits provided by the forest and perceptions in relation to climate change of 1,335 private forest owners in Sweden and Germany.

The Swedish forest owners were randomly sampled from contact people with forest holdings larger than 5 ha who were listed in the Swedish Real Property Register (Swedish Act 2000:224). Each recipient was assigned a code to enable targeted reminders to be sent to those who did not reply. To allow researchers to connect a particular answer to a particular respondent, the file containing responses needed to be cross-tabulated, which has not been done at any time. In Germany, the questionnaire was sent to all members of the forest owner organization Forstkammer Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg. The dispatch of these questionnaires was facilitated by this organization and the authors of this study had no access to identifying information for these individuals nor did they collect such information. The questionnaires were distributed by mail in spring 2010, accompanied by a covering letter explaining the objectives of the study and the purpose for which the data collected would be used. Respondents returned the questionnaires voluntarily as described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The research adhered to Swedish law on research involving human participants (Swedish Act 2003:460) and the handling of personal data (Swedish Act 1998:204).

Preferences for services and benefits were reported on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 denoting no value and 10 denoting the highest value (with missing data for individual questions interpreted as 0). In valuations of this kind, respondents are known to use scales of measurement that often are non-linear and that differ between individuals [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The optimally scaled transformations (&#x0003e;0) were then used for each country to co-cluster the benefits, services and respondents using the machine-learning technique of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999), to identify clusters of value items and show how the forest owners' preferences were loaded on these (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s003">S3</xref> Figs).

After ensuring that the tentative variables passed a test for collinearity based on the variance inflation factor [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we applied multinomial logistic regression to all five datasets in each country to test for differences between the groups that were differentiated by level of education and value profile with regard to their stated strength of belief in the local effects of climate change and having experienced the effects of climate change. The best and most parsimonious models were chosen by backward selection after adding all variables using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) as a performance indicator. The expected probabilities of the respondents' strengths of belief in the local effects of climate change and in having experienced the effects of climate change were estimated from 25,000 simulations drawn from the posterior distribution for each model. All analyses were conducted using the R Project for Statistical Computing packages v2.14.1 and v3.1.2 [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and in particular by applying the libraries "vcd" for visualizing categorical data [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], "Aspect" for optimal scaling [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], "NMF" for nonnegative matrix factorization [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], "APCluster" for Affinity Propagation Clustering [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], "Amelia II" for multiple imputation [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and "Zelig" for multinomial logistic regression modelling [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>In neither of the two countries was university education found to reduce the perception of risk from climate change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s010">S5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s013">S8</xref> Tables and Tables <xref rid="pone.0155137.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155137.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>). Indeed in most cases university education increased the perception of risk. Even more importantly, the effect of university education was not dependent on the individuals' value profile.

The "Forest user" value profile is driven primarily by self-sufficiency (<xref rid="pone.0155137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which indicates that those in this group spend considerable amounts of time in the forest, a finding that provides a non-value-based explanation of the observed difference.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p>The results show that the dynamics between valuations, educational level, and risk perception predicted by CCT are not at work in the domain investigated in this study. While this result is far from a refutation of the CCT as such, it does show that the CCT has no explanatory power in connection with the climate change responses among forest owners in Sweden and Germany. Furthermore, it provides information that is valuable in its own right in that it helps for understanding forest owner climate change response.</p><p>Other factors may contribute to the explanation of the differences between the results in [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the results presented in this study. It is possible that the combined measure of scientific literacy and numeracy that Kahan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] construct is not useful for predicting differences between people with different educational levels. Additionally, the methods used in our study account for particularities associated with the analysis of data on individual scales of measurement; Kahan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] assumed that the data fell on an interval scale to justify the use of linear regression methodology. Thus, in [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the use of linear regression methodology on rating scale and count data might have significantly affected the results.</p><p>We conclude that the results do not converge with those that would be expected if the mechanisms identified by the CCT were in play, and hence we find no evidence that forest owner value profiles exert a stronger influence on risk perception than university education does. This result is important for the design of effective strategies to engage forest owners to respond to climate change. While [<xref rid="pone.0155137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] suggests that climate change information should be adapted to the audience's valuations to be effective, the results in the present study imply that in most cases there is no reason to rule out education as a means of fostering understanding in forest owners who can learn about and adapt their decision-making to a changing world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec005"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155137.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Value clusters by country.</title><p>Clusters among 95 value items (numbers below each column correspond to questions in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s006">S1 Table</xref>) identified for optimally scaled valuations made by respondents in Sweden (a) and Germany (b) across 500 runs for each country, respectively.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155137.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155137.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Loadings on value items by country.</title><p>Loadings on value items estimated for valuations made by respondents (rows) in Sweden (a) and Germany (b) across 500 runs for each country, respectively.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155137.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155137.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Value profiles by country.</title><p>Value profiles for identified groups in Sweden (a) and Germany (b) based on individual respondents' preference loadings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) on all value clusters identified in each country (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), respectively.
