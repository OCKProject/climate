<p class="p">The benthic assemblage structure was analyzed at three stations that differed with respect to glacial influence, for example, sediment inputs originating from meltwater streams (South Coast creeks, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), substratum types, and the hydrographic characteristics of Potter Cove (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>). The Inner Station (I; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), located at the creeks’ debouch, is strongly affected by glacial meltwater and sediment discharge. Silt/clay sediments characterize this station. The Middle Station (M, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) is less affected by sediment input than the Inner Station in the shallows (15 to 20 m), but in similar ways between 25 and 30 m (
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">31</italic>
 </xref>). In the Middle Station, the substratum is formed by moraine deposits interspersed with fine sediments. The Outer Station (O, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) is the least influenced by sedimentation and is typified by hard substrata (

  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). Major shifts were observed in species composition, abundances, and benthic community structure in areas directly exposed to sedimentation, such as the Inner Station and deeper zones of the Middle Station, but not in the Outer Station where the effect of glacial discharge was minimal (

  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">31</italic>
 </xref>). The changes in species abundances and community structure are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and by the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and similarity percentage (SIMPER) analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, and tables S1 and S2). The nMDS analysis shows that the Outer Station and shallower zones of the Middle Station group together (all depths and sampled years), including the deeper areas of the Middle Station of 1994 and 1998. Whereas the Inner Station and the deeper zones of the Middle Station from 2010 clumped together in three subgroups, the first one grouped samples of 15 and 20 m except the 20-m samples of 1994. These samples were in the second subgroup closer to the deeper areas of the same year and the 30-m samples of 1998. The last subgroup clumped samples of 2010 from 25 and 30 m of the Inner and Middle stations. ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses indicated that these differences were statistically significant, the Inner Station showed a higher overall differentiation, and the pairwise comparison showed that higher dissimilarities were observed at deeper zones of the Inner and Middle stations, and that ascidians, sponges, and pennatulids are the taxa that contributed more to these differences in the Inner Station, whereas algae, ophiuroids, ascidians, and pennatulids were responsible for the differences observed in the Middle and Outer stations (
