<p class="p">In the last two decades, concentrations of SPM increased significantly in the inner Potter Cove (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), with mean values increasing from 7.5 mg liter
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to ca. 15 mg liter
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In contrast, no significant changes of SPM concentrations were observed at a hydrographic monitoring station close to our outer station (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). Maximum monthly mean values, measured since 1991, peaked in 1997 to 1998, then decreased and peaked again in 2008 to 2009 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). SPM and sediment accumulation at Potter Cove are mainly driven by meltwater runoff from the retreating Fourcade Glacier (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>). In the adjacent Maxwell Bay, where Potter Cove is tributary, mass accumulation rates of bulk sediment (MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub>) have tripled since the 1940s (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>). Consistently, MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub> estimations based on 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb analyses obtained from a sediment core sample (PO3) in the inner Potter Cove (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) indicated a continuous increase of sediment accumulation since 1900, and MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub> values around 1995 were three times those measured near 1900 and the highest registered so far (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and fig. S3). Both SPM and MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub> data sets provide evidence for a sedimentation maximum between 1995 and 1998, which was between our first two photographic surveys. However, the second peak in SPM of 2008 to 2009 was not reflected in the MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub>. These differences can be caused by parameters such as wind speed and wind direction, determining that most of the sediments can be either transported outside the cove or deposited on the bottom. The second SPM peak signal was lacking in the MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub> data, probably indicating that most of these sediments were carried out from the Inner cove by the prevailing currents and therefore affecting seabed organisms to a lesser extent. Moreover, MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub> data set integrated the accumulation of sediments on the bottom over longer time periods, offering a closer perspective on benthic fauna than SPM.
