<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but regional assessments to determine feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness are limited and rarely account for the interactive effects of future climate, atmospheric CO

We examine the net effect of all of these factors and a suite of mitigation strategies at fine resolution (4-km grid). Proven strategies immediately available to mitigate carbon emissions from forest activities include the following: (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) reforestation (growing forests where they recently existed), (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) afforestation (growing forests where they did not recently exist), (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) increasing carbon density of existing forests, and (

 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>), bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and increasing wood product use in buildings. However, examples of commercial-scale BECCS are still scarce, and sustainability of wood sources remains controversial because of forgone ecosystem carbon storage and low environmental cobenefits (

 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Carbon stored in buildings generally outlives its usefulness or is replaced within decades (
