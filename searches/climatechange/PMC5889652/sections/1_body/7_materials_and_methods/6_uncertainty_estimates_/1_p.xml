 </ext-link>). Uncertainty in NECB was calculated as the combined uncertainty of NEP, fire emissions (10%), harvest emissions (7%), and land cover estimates (10%) using the propagation of error approach. Uncertainty in CLM4.5 model simulations and LCA were quantified by combining the uncertainty in the observations used to evaluate the model, the uncertainty in input datasets (e.g., remote sensing), and the uncertainty in the LCA coefficients (
