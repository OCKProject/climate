<p class="p">Decomposition of wood through the product cycle was computed using an LCA (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Carbon emissions to the atmosphere from harvest were calculated annually over the time frame of the analysis (2001â€“2015). The net carbon emissions equal NECB plus total harvest minus wood lost during manufacturing and wood decomposed over time from product use. Wood industry fossil fuel emissions were computed for harvest, transportation, and manufacturing processes. Carbon credit was calculated for wood product storage, substitution, and internal mill recycling of wood losses for bioenergy.
