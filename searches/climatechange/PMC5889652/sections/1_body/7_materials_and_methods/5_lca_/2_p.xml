<p class="p">Products were divided into sawtimber, pulpwood, and wood and paper products using published coefficients (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). Long-term and short-term products were assumed to decay at 2% and 10% per year, respectively (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). For product substitution, we focused on manufacturing for long-term structures (building life span &gt;30 y). Because it is not clear when product substitution started in the Pacific Northwest, we evaluated it starting in 1970 since use of concrete and steel for housing was uncommon before 1965. The displacement value for product substitution was assumed to be 2.1 Mg fossil C/Mg C wood use in long-term structures (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>), and although it likely fluctuates over time, we assumed it was constant. We accounted for losses in product substitution associated with building replacement (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>) using a loss rate of 2% per year (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), but ignored leakage related to fossil C use by other sectors, which may result in more substitution benefit than will actually occur.
