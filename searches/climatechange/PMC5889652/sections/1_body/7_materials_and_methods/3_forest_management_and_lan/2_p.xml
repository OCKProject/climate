We assumed no competition with conversion of irrigated grass crops to urban growth, given Oregonâ€™s land use laws for developing within urban growth boundaries. A separate study suggested that, on average, about 17% of all irrigated agricultural crops in the Willamette Valley could be converted to urban area under future climate; however, because 20% of total cropland is grass seed, it suggests little competition with urban growth (
