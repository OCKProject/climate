<p class="p">Harvest cycles, reforestation, and afforestation were simulated to the year 2100. Carbon stocks and NEP were predicted for the current harvest cycle of 45 y compared with simulations extending it to 80 y. Reforestation potential was simulated over areas that recently suffered mortality from harvest, fire, and 12 species of beetles (

We assumed the same vegetation regrew to the maximum potential, which is expected with the combination of natural regeneration and planting that commonly occurs after these events. Future BAU harvest files were constructed using current harvest rates, where county-specific average harvest and the actual amounts per ownership were used to guide grid cell selection. This resulted in the majority of harvest occurring on private land (70%) and in the mesic ecoregions. Beetle outbreaks were implemented using a modified mortality rate of the lodgepole pine PFT with 0.1% y
