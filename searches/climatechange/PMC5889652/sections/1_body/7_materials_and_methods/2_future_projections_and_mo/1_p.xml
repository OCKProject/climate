<p class="p">Carbon stocks and NEP were quantified to the years 2025, 2050, and 2100 using CLM4.5 with physiological parameters for 10 major forest species, initial forest biomass (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>), and future climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide as input (Institut Pierre Simon Laplace climate system model downscaled to 4 km Ã— 4 km, representative concentration pathway 8.5). CLM4.5 uses 3-h climate data, ecophysiological characteristics, site physical characteristics, and site history to estimate the daily fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and water between the atmosphere, plant state variables, and litter and soil state variables. Model components are biogeophysics, hydrological cycle, and biogeochemistry. This model version does not include a dynamic vegetation model to simulate resilience and establishment following disturbance. However, the effect of regeneration lags on forest carbon is not particularly strong for the long disturbance intervals in this study (
