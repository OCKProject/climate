<p class="p">Historical disturbance regimes were simulated using stand age and disturbance history from remote sensing products. Comparisons of Community Land Model (CLM4.5) output with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) aboveground tree biomass (&gt;6,000 plots) were within 1 SD of the ecoregion means (

CLM4.5 estimates of cumulative burn area and emissions from 1990 to 2014 were 14% and 25% less than observed, respectively. The discrepancy was mostly due to the model missing an anomalously large fire in 2002 (

 </ext-link>). A sensitivity test of a 14% underestimate of burn area did not affect our final results because predicted emissions would increase almost equally for business as usual (BAU) management and our scenarios, resulting in no proportional change in NECB. However, the ratio of harvest to fire emissions would be lower.
