<p class="p">Harvest cycles in the mesic and montane forests have declined from over 120 y to 45 y despite the fact that these trees can live 500–1,000 y and net primary productivity peaks at 80–125 y (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). If harvest cycles were lengthened to 80 y on private lands and harvested area was reduced 50% on public lands, state-level stocks would increase by 17% to a total of ∼3,600 Tg C and NECB would increase 2–3 Tg C y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> by 2100. The lengthened harvest cycles reduced harvest by 2 Tg C y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which contributed to higher NECB. Leakage (more harvest elsewhere) is difficult to quantify and could counter these carbon gains. However, because harvest on federal lands was reduced significantly since 1992 (NW Forest Plan), leakage has probably already occurred.
