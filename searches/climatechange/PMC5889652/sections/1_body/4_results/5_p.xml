<p class="p">We evaluated emission reduction strategies in the forest sector: protecting existing forest carbon, lengthening harvest cycles, reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy production with product substitution. The largest potential increase in forest carbon is in the mesic Coast Range and West Cascade ecoregions. These forests are buffered by the ocean, have high soil water-holding capacity, low risk of wildfire [fire intervals average 260–400 y (
