<p class="p">We examined the potential for using existing harvest residue for electricity generation, where burning the harvest residue for energy emits carbon immediately (

Assuming half of forest residues from harvest practices could be used to replace natural gas or coal in distributed facilities across the state, they would provide an average supply of 0.75–1 Tg C y

Compared with BAU harvest practices, where residues are left to decompose, proposed bioenergy production would increase cumulative net emissions by up to 45 Tg C by 2100. Even at 50% use, residue collection and transport are not likely to be economically viable, given the distances (&gt;200 km) to Oregon’s facilities.
