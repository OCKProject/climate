<p class="p">Afforestation of old fields within forest boundaries and nonfood/nonforage grass crops, hereafter referred to as “grass crops,” had to meet minimum conditions for tree growth, and crop grid cells had to be partially forested (

These crops are not grazed or used for animal feed. Competing land uses may decrease the actual amount of area that can be afforested. We calculated the amount of irrigated grass crops (127,000 ha) that could be converted to forest, assuming success of carbon offset programs (
