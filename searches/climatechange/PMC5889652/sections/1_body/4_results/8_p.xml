<p class="p">We quantified cobenefits of afforestation of irrigated grass crops on water availability based on data from hydrology and agricultural simulations of future grass crop area and related irrigation demand (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). Afforestation of 127,000 ha of grass cropland with Douglas fir could decrease irrigation demand by 222 and 233 billion m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>⋅y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> by 2050 and 2100, respectively. An independent estimate from measured precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) at our mature Douglas fir and grass crop flux sites in the Willamette Valley shows the ET/precipitation fraction averaged 33% and 52%, respectively, and water balance (precipitation minus ET) averaged 910 mm⋅y

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Under current climate conditions, the observations suggest an increase in annual water availability of 260 billion m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> if 127,000 ha of the irrigated grass crops were converted to forest.
