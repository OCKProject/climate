 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e and almost 10-fold fire emissions, mostly due to lower fire emissions. The net wood product emissions are higher than fire emissions despite carbon benefits of storage in wood products and substitution for more fossil fuel-intensive products. Hence, combining fire and net wood product emissions, the forest sector emissions averaged 40 million tCO

Fire emissions were only between 4% and 8% of total emissions from all sources (2011–2015 and 2001–2004, respectively). Oregon’s forests play a larger role in meeting its GHG targets than US forests have in meeting the nation’s targets (
