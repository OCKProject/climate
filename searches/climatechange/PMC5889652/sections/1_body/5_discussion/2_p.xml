<p class="p">Harvest-related emissions had a large impact on recent forest NECB, reducing it by an average of 34% from 2001 to 2015. By comparison, fire emissions were relatively small and reduced NECB by 12% in the Biscuit Fire year, but only reduced NECB 5â€“9% from 2006 to 2015. Thus, altered forest management has the potential to enhance the forest carbon balance and reduce emissions.</p>
