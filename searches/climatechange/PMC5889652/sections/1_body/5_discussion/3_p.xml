<p class="p">Future NEP increased because enhancement from atmospheric carbon dioxide outweighed the losses from fire. Lengthened harvest cycles on private lands to 80 y and restricting harvest to 50% of current rates on public lands increased NECB the most by 2100, accounting for 90% of total emissions reduction (

Reduced harvest led to NECB increasing earlier than the other strategies (by 2050), suggesting this could be a priority for implementation.
