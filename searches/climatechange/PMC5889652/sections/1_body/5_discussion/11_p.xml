<p class="p">Increased long-term storage in buildings and via product substitution has been suggested as a potential climate mitigation option. Pacific temperate forests can store carbon for many hundreds of years, which is much longer than is expected for buildings that are generally assumed to outlive their usefulness or be replaced within several decades (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). By 2035, about 75% of buildings in the United States will be replaced or renovated, based on new construction, demolition, and renovation trends (

 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Recent analysis suggests substitution benefits of using wood versus more fossil fuel-intensive materials have been overestimated by at least an order of magnitude (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). Our LCA accounts for losses in product substitution stores (PSSs) associated with building life span, and thus are considerably lower than when no losses are assumed (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). While product substitution reduces the overall forest sector emissions, it cannot offset the losses incurred by frequent harvest and losses associated with product transportation, manufacturing, use, disposal, and decay. Methods for calculating substitution benefits should be improved in other regional assessments.
