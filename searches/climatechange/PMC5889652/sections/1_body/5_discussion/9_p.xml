<p class="p">Oregon has a legislated mandate to reduce emissions, and is considering an offsets program that limits use of offsets to 8% of the total emissions reduction to ensure that regulated entities substantially reduce their own emissions, similar to Californiaâ€™s program (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). An offset becomes a net emissions reduction by increasing the forest carbon sink (NECB). If only 8% of the GHG reduction is allowed for forest offsets, the limits for forest offsets would be 2.1 and 8.4 million metric tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e of total emissions by 2025 and 2050, respectively (

The combination of afforestation, reforestation, and reduced harvest would provide 13 million metric tCO
