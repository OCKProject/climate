<p class="p">Although western Oregon is mesic with little expected change in precipitation, the afforestation cobenefits of increased water availability will be important. Urban demand for water is projected to increase, but agricultural irrigation will continue to consume much more water than urban use (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests appears to be a winâ€“win strategy, returning some of the area to forest land, providing habitat and connectivity for forest species, and easing irrigation demand. Because the afforested grass crop represents only 11% of the available grass cropland (1.18 million ha), it is not likely to result in leakage or indirect land use change. The two forest strategies combined are likely to be important contributors to water security.
