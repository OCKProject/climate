<p class="p">Cobenefits with biodiversity were not assessed in our study. However, a recent study showed that in the mesic forests, cobenefits with biodiversity of forest species are largest on lands with harvest cycles longer than 80 y, and thus would be most pronounced on private lands (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). We selected 80 y for the harvest cycle mitigation strategy because productivity peaks at 80â€“125 y in this region, which coincides with the point at which cobenefits with wildlife habitat are substantial.
