<p class="p">Habitat loss and climate change are the two greatest threats to biodiversity. Afforestation of areas that are currently grass crops would likely improve the habitat of forest species (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>), as about 90% of the forests in these areas were replaced by agriculture. About 45 mammal species are at risk because of range contraction (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Forests are more efficient at dissipating heat than grass and crop lands, and forest cover gains lead to net surface cooling in all regions south of about 45° latitude in North American and Europe (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). The cooler conditions can buffer climate-sensitive bird populations from approaching their thermal limits and provide more food and nest sites (
