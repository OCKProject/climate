<p class="p">Many US states, including Oregon (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), plan to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We evaluated strategies to address this question: How much carbon can the region’s forests realistically remove from the atmosphere in the future, and which forest carbon strategies can reduce regional emissions by 2025, 2050, and 2100? We propose an integrated approach that combines observations with models and a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate current and future effects of mitigation actions on forest carbon and forest sector emissions in temperate regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). We estimated the recent carbon budget of Oregon’s forests, and simulated the potential to increase the forest sink and decrease forest sector emissions under current and future climate conditions. We provide recommendations for regional assessments of mitigation strategies.
