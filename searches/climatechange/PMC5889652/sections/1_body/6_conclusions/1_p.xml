<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">GHG reduction must happen quickly to avoid surpassing a 2 Â°C increase in temperature since preindustrial times. Alterations in forest management can contribute to increasing the land sink and decreasing emissions by keeping carbon in high biomass forests, extending harvest cycles, reforestation, and afforestation. Forests are carbon-ready and do not require new technologies or infrastructure for immediate mitigation of climate change. Growing forests for bioenergy production competes with forest carbon sequestration and does not reduce emissions in the next decades (

Accurate accounting of forest carbon in trees and soils, NECB, and historic harvest rates, combined with transparent quantification of emissions from the wood product process, can ensure realistic reductions in forest sector emissions.
