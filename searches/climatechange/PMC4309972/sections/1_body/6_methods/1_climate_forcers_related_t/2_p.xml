<p class="p">The climate forcers E1–E3 refer to climate change impacts through the effects of the atmospheric Nr species (including N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, NO
 <sub class="sub">x,</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) on trapping heat or scattering solar energy. So far, there has been no official national inventory of gaseous Nr species for China. The results from many published studies show a certain inconsistency due to the different approaches used. Rather than calculating the Nr emissions inventory, we compiled Nr emissions from the existing regional and global emissions inventories associated with China, including IIASA GAINS, EDGAR v4, RCPs, and MACCity. The data covered total volumes and sectoral structures of Nr emissions within the period 2000–2005 (
