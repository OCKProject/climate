<p class="p">China is a large agricultural country with an enormous animal population and tremendous N fertilizer consumption. The characteristics of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> emissions reflect the intensity of synthetic fertilizer use and unique patterns of animal densities and types in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. As the human population continues to demonstrate considerable growth, food production and associated NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> emissions are likely to increase as well
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. Increased NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> produce radiative effects resulting from sulfate-nitrate aerosol and single-nitrate aerosol, respectively. The cooling effect of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> through the direct aerosol effect is larger than NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> on a 20-y basis, but its depletion rate with time is faster than the rate of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Global model studies demonstrated that the increasing nitrate aerosol force would counteract the expected decline in the sulfate force by 2010
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>. The future nitrate aerosol loads are projected to depend strongly on the emission strength of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. It can be deduced that a larger increase in nitrate aerosols in China will be accompanied by larger increases of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, as opposed to the smaller increases in Europe, the U.S. and Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. Although the cooling effect of nitrate aerosols is negligible in the long term, the future air pollution from nitrate in the atmosphere can not be ignored.
