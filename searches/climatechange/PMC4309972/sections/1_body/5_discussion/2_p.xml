<p class="p">The strong GTP and long lifetime of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O makes it the largest and most lasting contributor to global warming in China. Agriculture is responsible for about 80% of the climate warming effect of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. The high N fertilizer input and low N use efficiency in China's agricultural fields are responsible for the increasing N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Our scenario analysis shows that a larger mitigation potential for climate change could be realized through improving N use efficiency to reduce agricultural N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions. Many approaches can be taken to enhance N use efficiency, for example, systematic crop rotation, wise use of fertilizer, and expanded use of nitrification inhibitors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. Although the agricultural activities are the largest contributor, emission of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O from chemical industries also shows a large increase potential; and the control options are the most-effective in this sector
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Hence, the all-around measures to reduce N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emission from agriculture and industry could lead to the co-benefits of climate mitigation and positive environmental effect through protecting ozone layer.
