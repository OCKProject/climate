<p class="p">China—especially the east region—is one of the global heavy N-deposition areas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. Under the action of N deposition, our results show forest land in China is the single largest C sink, followed by grassland and cropland. The N status of different ecosystems in China can be reflected and further analyzed from the flux factors of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S6</xref>. For example, N is usually found to be a limiting factor in plant growth in grassland ecosystems in China, and it is mostly unintended fertilization that has stimulated plant growth there
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>; while almost all croplands can be regarded as N-saturated ecosystems due to continual application of chemical N fertilizers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>, as a results, the N-induced flux factor of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is only 0.45–1.7 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg N. Additionally, there have been very different response patterns of forest ecosystems in China depending on the forest type, the N status of the soil, and the level of N deposition. In N-saturated mature tropical forests, high N addition can reduce soil respiration and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref>, and decrease CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> uptake rate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. However, in N-limited pine forests, elevated N deposition has no significant effect on soil respiration or CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> uptake
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. Overall, the N-induced flux factor of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in forest lands in China is 5–27 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg N, much lower than that of the United States, with 24–65 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg N
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Throughout the whole of China, the terrestrial system acts as a net C sink due to N deposition. However, the potential for sustaining more terrestrial C storage as a result of atmospheric N deposition is limited
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. As the N deposition increases, the net primary productivity induced by per-unit N deposition has leveled off or declined since the 1980s, indicating that part of the deposited N may not be invested to stimulate plant growth, but instead leave the ecosystem by various pathways
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. In addition, globally N fertilizer application-induced CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake began to level off in the 1980s whereas N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emission continued to grow
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" class="xref">49</xref>. As a result, the climate benefits of the enhanced C sequestration would likely be eliminated due to increased N use
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" class="xref">50</xref>. Finally, fertilized N will show an increasing warming effect in the future. This trend is more obvious in China. Excessive N-fertilization limits C sequestration. The declining rate of manure recycling to fields causes more N discharge into water or emitted into the air
