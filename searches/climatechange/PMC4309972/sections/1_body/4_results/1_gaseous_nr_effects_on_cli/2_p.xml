<p class="p">NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> contribute to climate change indirectly through altering the atmospheric constituents and corresponding climate forcers. NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> is a major byproduct of combustion. Fuel combustion in China resulted in a total of 4.04–6.08 Tg N of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions in 2005, mainly from the combustion sectors of power plants (1.15–2.08 Tg N), transportation (1.26–1.66 Tg N), industry (1.35–1.79 Tg N) and household use (0.27–0.54 Tg N). Agricultural soils contribute a minor part with only 0.17 Tg NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>-N, mainly through microbial activity from agricultural soils. In sum, 4.34–6.24 Tg N is released to the atmosphere in the form of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>. In comparison, the total emissions of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were 7.69–12.3 Tg N in 2005, becoming the largest source of atmospheric Nr in China. Agricultural soils (including volatilization and applied fertilizer and manure) and animal and human manure management are the main contributors, at 2.30–5.20 and 4.37–6.02 Tg N, respectively; other sources are negligible for the country as a whole. As a result, the combined climate impact of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> on ozone and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (i.e. ozone-CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> effect, E2) in China is −350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a 20-y and 100-y basis, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S7</xref>). Our results show that the net cooling effect of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> on ozone and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is notable only at a shorter time horizon, and gradually wears off with increasing time horizon. In addition, exposure to tropospheric ozone is known to inhibit photosynthesis, damage plants, and reduce plant primary productivity and land C sequestration capacity (E6)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. The reduction in C sequestration due to the ozone effect for China has been simulated by the terrestrial ecosystem model and estimated at 111 ± 100 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e under controlled simulations for different scenarios
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Therefore, the negative effects on the climate system and crop yields due to the indirect radiative forcing of ozone in China cannot be ignored. Both NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> can enhance the formation of light-scattering aerosols (E3). Compared with the NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> effect on the ozone-CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> effect (−350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> and a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis, respectively), the direct aerosol effect of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> is much less, with only −97 ± 39 and −0.006 ± 0.004 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> and a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis, respectively; while the corresponding NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> effects on aerosol are −59 ± 23 and −0.11 ± 0.13 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e, respectively. As the time horizon is extended, the direct aerosol effects of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> both become smaller, and can be effectively ignored on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis (
