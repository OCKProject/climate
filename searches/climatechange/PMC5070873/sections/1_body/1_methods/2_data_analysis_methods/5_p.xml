<p class="p">We used a model selection process based on Akaikeâ€™s information criterion to determine which models were best supported [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Our response variable violated the distributional assumptions of a generalized linear mixed model in being heavily skewed towards four and five. Because this skew could not be addressed via transformation, we used a multinomial logistic regression model. We collapsed the response variable from five to three numeric factors as follows: we collapsed 1 and 2 into 1, 3 into 2, and 4 and 5 into 3. We did a parallel analysis with the 5-level response variable to verify that the recategorization of the response variable did not alter the main results.
