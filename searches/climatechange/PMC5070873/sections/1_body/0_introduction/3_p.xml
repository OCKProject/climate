<p class="p">Although game theory addresses the ultimate, evolutionary causes of behavior, a broad array of proximate, psychological and cognitive mechanisms potentially influence the willingness of individuals and groups to act on difficult problems like climate change. Response to climate change can have existential [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. This complexity means that the relationship between attitudes, intentions, and behavior is not straightforward [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Even when we believe climate change is real and caused by humans, heuristics and cognitive biases can hinder our ability to act [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. People who exhibit environmental concern do not always know which behaviors help with a particular environmental problem, for example, they may underestimate the effect of purchase choice on carbon emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Individual differences and culture shape how people respond through their effects on self-construal, how people see themselves in relation to others and the natural world [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. People who define themselves as having an implicit connection to others (meta-personal self-construal) are most likely to express environmental concern and take action [
