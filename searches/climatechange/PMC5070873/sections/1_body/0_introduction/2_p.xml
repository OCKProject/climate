<p class="p">The dim view of human potential for collective action that arose in the mid-nineteenth century [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] was revolutionized in the past few decades as theoreticians began to recognize that social costs and benefits of cooperative acts could be as important as the material costs and benefits [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The theoretical result is that collective action is more likely when individuals can choose their cooperation partners, when their actions and reputations are visible to others, and when cooperative social norms and benchmarks are made salient [

 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Including the potential for social rewards and sanctions in game theoretic models and empirical studies of environmental behavior has already painted a more optimistic picture of the potential for humans to avoid the tragedy of the commons [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] than those originally put forth by Olson [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and Hardin [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Increased understanding of social costs and benefits driving cooperation [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] provides a theoretical basis for inclusion of normative beliefs and subjective social norms in models of behavior change, like the theory of planned behavior [
 <xref rid="pone.0163852.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], but even with these new insights, our ability to design effective programs that move large groups of people towards new kinds of energy use and lower levels of consumption is still limited.
