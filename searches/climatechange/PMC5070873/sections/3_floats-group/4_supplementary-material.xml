  <title class="title">Results of multinomial model after elimination of the ‘belief in climate change’ predictor variable.</title>
  <p class="p">This model includes 65 additional participants who did not know whether they believed in climate change or not for a total of 980 participants. The analysis was conducted to look for bias due to not including those participants in the original set of models. All predictor variables significant/not significant here were significant/not significant in the more inclusive model.</p>
