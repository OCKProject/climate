  <p class="p">Effects of genetic differentiation between parental populations, as well as midparent temperature and precipitation on performance of 
   <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic>. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Among between‐population crosses, increased genetic divergence between parental populations had a positive effect on lifetime fitness (number of seeds produced by each seed that was planted). The regression line and 95% confidence interval show the effects of F
   <sub class="sub">ST</sub> when T
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub> and P
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub> are held constant. These incorporate both the conditional and zero‐inflation model components; the confidence interval is conditioned on fixed effects only. Points are raw averages for each gene flow source in each garden, colored by the distance between the source population and the garden (the home of the recipient population). 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Regression estimates and standard errors of genetic differentiation (F
   <sub class="sub">ST</sub>) and absolute midparent temperature differences (T
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub>) on the probability of producing seeds. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Effects of genetic differentiation, temperature differences, and absolute precipitation differences (P
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub>) on conditional seed production. 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> Effects of T
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub> and F
   <sub class="sub">ST</sub> on component lifestages of 
   <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic>. Precipitation differences were not significant when tested for component lifestages. Directionality of effects is illustrated with “+” and “‐”. Not quite significant parameters (0.05 &lt; 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.10) are shown in boxes with dashed margins, predictors in solid boxes are significant (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Size in the previous lifestage is not shown here, but has a significant positive effect on overwinter and reproductive lifestages. * indicates predictors that are only significant in separate models, not in full models with all predictors. Complete statistical results of these tests are in Table 
   <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref> and Table 
   <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>.
