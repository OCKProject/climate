Focal population sites (where common gardens were installed) are indicated by “F” and donor population sites are indicated by “D”.

   <xref rid="evl391-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Colored circles represent the 1951‐1980 average September‐July temperature and summed April‐July precipitation in the home site of each population. Open circles represent weather conditions during the experiment. Focal populations are historically intermediate relative to donor populations in average historic temperature (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐axis), but are from the driest sites of any population used in the experiment (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>‐axis). Conditions in common gardens during the experiment were hot relative to normal conditions at those sites, and hot and dry relative to average conditions of all populations in the experiment. Conditions during the experiment were not quite as warm as projected temperatures for 2055 under the HadGEM2‐ES RCP 4.5 model (grey text; downscaled using ClimateNA, Wang et al.
