  <p class="p">Effects of gene flow (differences between between‐population and within‐population crosses) on performance of 
   <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic>, accounting for midparent temperature and precipitation. Lifetime fitness (the number of seeds produced by each seed that was planted) incorporates germination, survival, and reproduction. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Regression estimates and standard errors from the zero‐inflation part of a model of lifetime fitness. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Regression estimates and standard errors from the conditional part of a model of lifetime fitness. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Effects of gene flow (GF), absolute midparent temperature differences (T
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub>), and absolute midparent precipitation differences (P
   <sub class="sub">diff</sub>) on component lifestages of 
   <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic>. Directionality of effects is illustrated with “+” and “‐”. Not quite significant parameters (0.05 &lt; 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.10) are shown in boxes with dashed margins, predictors in solid boxes are significant (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Size in the previous lifestage is not shown here, but has a significant positive effect on overwinter and reproductive lifestages. This summarizes the significant results of separate models for each lifestage; full statistical results of these tests are in Table
