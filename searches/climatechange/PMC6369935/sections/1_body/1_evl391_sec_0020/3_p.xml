<p class="p">Comprehensive empirical tests of the swamping gene flow hypothesis are difficult to conduct because they require demonstrating both the negative effects of gene flow on edge populations as well as the occurrence of asymmetric gene flow on the landscape. Evidence to date indicates that in some systems swamping gene flow might limit adaptation along geographic gradients (Paul et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) or between habitat types (Anderson and Geber 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Farkas et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and may sometimes limit the geographic range (Fedorka et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Holliday et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, in other systems, there are no detectable fitness costs of gene flow across environmental gradients (Emery 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Moore and Hendry 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Samis et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and strong local adaptation persists despite gene flow (Yeaman and Jarvis 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gould et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Outbreeding depression may generate patterns similar to those resulting from the disruption of local adaptation, but the effects of genetic incompatibilities can be discerned from those of swamping by experimental designs that allow for decoupling of environmental and genetic differentiation.
