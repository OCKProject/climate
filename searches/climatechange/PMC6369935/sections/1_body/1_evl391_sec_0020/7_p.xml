<p class="p">To investigate how gene flow affects peripheral populations, we simulated gene flow among populations spanning the northern half of the range of an annual wildflower, 
 <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic>, and measured lifetime fitness of individuals in two common gardens at the species' northern range edge. We asked: (1) Are range edge populations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic> locally adapted? (2) What climatic factors predict fitness at the northern range edge? (3) Does gene flow positively or negatively affect edge populations? And (4) How does the effect of gene flow from other populations depend upon the genetic differentiation and climatic distances of these populations? Under conditions where the range edge is not at equilibrium with climate, we expect that gene flow from sites that are historically similar to the experimental conditions will improve performance. Under conditions in which this species' range is at equilibrium with climate, and if this edge is limited by adaptation, we expect that gene flow from populations in similar climates will have a positive effect on fitness via heterosis or the contribution of adaptive alleles, but that gene flow from strongly contrasting climates will be detrimental. If populations have genetic incompatibilities (which need not be the result of divergent selection, but could simply be the result of drift under prolonged separation) then we expect the offspring of crosses between populations that are more genetically divergent to perform worse, regardless of the conditions of the test environment. However, if homozygosity is negatively related to fitness, we expect a greater benefit from gene flow between more genetically divergent populations.
