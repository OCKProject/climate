<p class="p">Swamping gene flow is another often‐invoked hypothesis for how equilibrial range limits might form and persist (Lenormand

 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Under swamping gene flow, peripheral populations are unable to adapt to their local conditions because they experience maladaptive gene flow from central populations (Kirkpatrick and Barton 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). This process is predicted to occur when populations are arranged along an environmental gradient where individuals are well adapted and abundant in the center of that gradient. Because of this asymmetry in abundance, net gene flow is asymmetric and brings alleles that are adaptive in central environments to edge populations, disrupting local adaptation to edge environments. This causes edge populations to become demographic sinks, where death rates exceed birth rates, and prevents further range expansion. According to this model, the fitness of edge populations will depend upon the rate of gene flow from center to edge as well as the steepness of the environmental gradient (i.e., the magnitude of environmental differences between the sources of the gene flow and the recipient populations).
