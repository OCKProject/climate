<p class="p">If range limits represent limits to adaptation, this could be the result of insufficient genetic variation in range edge populations. Limited genetic variation at range edges is predicted because range edge populations are often characterized as small, with more frequent or severe changes in population size and elevated rates of turnover relative to central populations (Vucetich and Waite 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Populations that are on the leading edge of range expansions may also exhibit patterns of low genetic variation as a result of successive founder events (Pujol and Pannell 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Significant declines in neutral genetic variation near range edges is a common (although not ubiquitous) pattern (Eckert et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Pironon et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), indicating that some of these processes are likely to affect some range edges in some species. If the observed declines in neutral variation also reflect reduced adaptive genetic variation, this might result in marginal populations being less locally adapted when compared to central populations, as they have less capacity to respond to local selection pressures. Maladaptation is expected to lead to poor demographic performance, reducing colonization opportunities in sites beyond the range, and potentially creating (or reinforcing) a range edge at equilibrium along an environmental gradient (Kirkpatrick and Barton
