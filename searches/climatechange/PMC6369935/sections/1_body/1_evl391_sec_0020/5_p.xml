<p class="p">In addition to contributing alleles that are adaptive or maladaptive in a given environment, gene flow may provide relief from homozygosity caused by drift or inbreeding. Gene flow is expected to increase heterozygosity and reintroduce variation that can allow for masking or purging of fixed deleterious alleles. As a result, gene flow can improve fitness in peripheral populations (Sexton et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The extent to which gene flow causes heterosis depends upon the genetic divergence of populations (Ingvarsson and Whitlock 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), but not explicitly on the magnitude of the environmental differences between the source and recipient of gene flow, although environmental differences are correlated with genetic differentiation in some species (Sexton et al.
