<p class="p">Gene flow may also be beneficial when maladaptation arises due to disequilibrium between a populations' optimal conditions and the environment. This could occur when a species is undergoing a range expansion, or when the environmental landscape is moving out from under individuals, as is occurring under climate change (Aitken and Whitlock 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). If a population is locally adapted to historic conditions in a site, and the environment changes rapidly, then gene flow from populations with historic conditions that are more similar to these new local conditions is expected to improve population performance.
