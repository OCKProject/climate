<p class="p">Most theory about swamping gene flow at range edges has been developed with the assumption of smooth environmental gradients underlying the range, however, this assumption is unrealistic for most species. Topography, continentality, and other landscape features make transects from range centers to edges heterogenous with regards to climate. Other habitat variables, such as soil type or the biotic community (which may mediate responses to climate in addition to imposing selection on their own) are also likely to be spatially heterogeneous. This complicates predictions of the swamping gene flow hypothesis: range edge populations may experience gene flow from environmentally divergent neighboring populations, or environmentally similar central populations, as well as combinations falling anywhere in between. In this case, geography cannot be used as a proxy for predictions about the effects of gene flow; rather, these predictions must be informed by the environmental differences between populations. Gene flow between populations in similar environments may be beneficial, even when populations are geographically disparate, because gene flow can allow for the spread of environment‐specific beneficial alleles that arise in a single population (Sexton et al.
