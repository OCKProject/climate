<p class="p">Species are limited in their geographic extents on the landscape. In many cases, the limits of species' geographic distributions are the result of niche limitation, rather than simply an inability to disperse to suitable areas beyond their current distribution (Lee‐Yaw et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This raises the question of what prevents populations on the range periphery from adapting to sites beyond the range edge (Antonovics

 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), particularly when boundaries are not co‐incident with an abrupt shift in the abiotic environment. The putative causes of limits to adaptation at the range edge hinge upon demographic and genetic features of metapopulations (Sexton et al.
