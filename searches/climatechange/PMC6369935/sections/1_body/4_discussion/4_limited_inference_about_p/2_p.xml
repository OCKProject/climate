<p class="p">It is also important to note that all populations in our experiment had reproductive rates that were well above replacement (one seed produced per seed planted, see

 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>A), so we have no evidence that gene flow has the potential to drive populations extinct or to rescue them from extinction. The high lifetime fitness we observed during our experiment could be due to several factors. First, perhaps warm conditions over the entire season are favorable for all sources, but are more favorable for warm‐adapted populations. Alternatively, we could have increased fitness by limiting antagonistic biotic interactions. Additionally, our conversion from ovary length to seed production estimates assumes that pollinator service is at least as effective as our hand pollinations and that seed production is not resource‐limited. If preventing pollinator access increased fruit production due to within‐plant resource reallocation, our estimates of fitness from ovary length could be overestimates. Finally, and perhaps most plausibly, our plot placement may have upwardly biased our fitness estimates. We placed plots in patches that appeared favorable to

We do not know whether any of these factors interact with provenance, in which case they might change the relative performances of populations in our experiment.
