<p class="p">Our ability to make inferences from our results about the longer‐term effects of gene flow on the persistence and adaptive potential of range edge populations is limited. It seems clear that gene flow from warm sites is likely to accelerate adaptation to warming conditions, but we do not know whether these populations were historically limited by adaptation and whether the additional genetic variation introduced by gene flow would permit better adaptation to local conditions and range expansion on an evolutionary time scale. These types of questions are difficult to test in field systems (but see Etterson and Shaw 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), but inferences can be made by examining genetic variance of wild populations in the laboratory (Kellermann et al.

The development of experimental evolution systems to test equilibrial range dynamics is an exciting avenue for future work—this would be a natural extension of recent studies of range expansion dynamics using experimental evolution in the laboratory (Ochocki and Miller
