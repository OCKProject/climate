<p class="p">On heterogeneous landscapes, the effects of gene flow are likely to depend strongly on climate of origin, which may be decoupled from geography. Although gene flow from divergent climates may result in reduced fitness, gene flow can also confer benefits to range edge populations via both preadapted alleles and reduced homozygosity. As a result, moderate rates of gene flow likely represent a net benefit to edge populations, particularly as the environment is changing. This study highlights the challenges of testing hypotheses about equilibrial range limits in the field, where climate change is a persistent reality. Even if populations were once locally adapted, they are likely no longer at equilibrium with climate. The signal of climate anomalies disrupting local adaptation can be detected in published literature to date (Bontrager et al., in prep.). In light of this, future studies of local adaptation at range edges should be designed in such a way that the results will be informative even in non‐equilibrial conditions.</p>
