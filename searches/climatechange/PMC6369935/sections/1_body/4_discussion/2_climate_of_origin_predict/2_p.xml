<p class="p">Under climate change, local adaptation to historic climate regimes may generate local maladaptation in field trials. We see this in our results: populations from warmer locations performed best in our gardens (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>) and outperformed local populations (Supporting Information Analysis 1 and Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>), and gene flow from warmer locations had positive effects on some lifestages (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). This lagging adaptation to climate has been documented in other recent common garden studies. In a reciprocal transplant experiment of a long‐lived sedge, McGraw et al. (
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that populations were displaced 140 km south of their optimal climate conditions. Wilczek et al. (
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that local genotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> from across Europe were consistently outperformed in common gardens by accessions from historically warmer locations. These results indicate that dispersal and gene flow are important processes promoting range stasis as climate warms, as they allow alleles that are beneficial in warm environments to spread from historically warm populations to recently warming sites. However, climate is multivariate, and as the climate changes it may generate combinations of conditions that no population has historically experienced (Williams and Jackson 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Mahony et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The particular combination of hot and dry conditions in our common gardens was unlike any of our populations' historic temperature and precipitation combinations and approached future climate projections for these sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), although they are similar to normals from some populations not included in our experiment, primarily from the southern half of the species range (data not shown). While precipitation conditions were similar to those historically experienced by the focal populations, temperature conditions favored another set of populations. Whether the optimal traits for different climatic axes are antagonistic and whether segregation and recombination will allow adaptation to novel climates are important considerations in predicting climate change responses.
