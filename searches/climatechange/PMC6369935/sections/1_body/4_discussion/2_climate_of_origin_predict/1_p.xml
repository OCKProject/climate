<p class="p">Populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic> are adapted to their historic climate regimes, a pattern consistent with findings in many other species (Anderson et al.

 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). When grown in common sites, the performance of individuals was determined by the degree to which conditions during the experiment deviated from historic temperature and precipitation averages of each provenance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Because of this local adaptation to climate, gene flow from sites that deviate from local conditions (in our experiment, sites that are cooler than the focal populations) had the potential to disrupt local adaptation, as indicated by the somewhat negative effects of midparent temperature differences on between‐population plants (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Although simulated gene flow from divergent environments had the potential to reduce fitness in this experiment, it is unlikely that gene flow occurs at a high enough rate among natural populations to swamp local adaptation. However, our results highlight that gene flow and dispersal need not be from populations that are geographically distant (or from the center of the range) to be climatically divergent from historic or current conditions. Rather, two of the most temperature‐mismatched populations used in the experiment are from sites nearest to our common gardens (populations D1 and D3; Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
