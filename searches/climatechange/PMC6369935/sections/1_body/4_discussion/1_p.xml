<p class="p">We conducted a common garden experiment at the northern range margin of 
 <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic> to examine how the effects of gene flow on peripheral populations vary with climatic and genetic differentiation between focal and source populations. We examined predictors of fitness of within‐population crosses, in which both parents originated from the same source population, as well as between‐population crosses, in which one parent was local to the common gardens and the other was from another population from across the northern half of the range of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic>. In our experiment, provenances of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic> from climates that most closely matched the conditions during the experiment performed best. Populations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic> at the northern range margin benefited from gene flow from warm source locations during the warm year of our experiment. Gene flow also conferred some benefits independent of climate, as evidenced by the positive effect of gene flow on later lifestages when controlling for temperature differences and the positive effect of increasing genetic differentiation between the parental populations.
