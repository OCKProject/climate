<p class="p">We saw some additional positive effects of gene flow once the effects of climate are controlled for (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). These positive effects may be the result of reduced homozygosity when parental plants come from two different populations; this inference is supported by the positive effect of genetic differentiation between parental populations on performance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). These results are also generally consistent with previous work in which experimental populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic> with higher genetic effective population sizes had lower extinction probabilities (Newman and Pilson 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). An interesting direction for future models of swamping gene flow along environmental gradients might be to explore whether incorporating heterosis‐dependent increases in the effective migration rate (Ingvarsson and Whitlock 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) alters predictions (this could be done with various dispersal distances, under scenarios of various magnitudes of isolation‐by‐distance). However, an important question is whether the benefits of reduced homozygosity (or increased heterozygosity) are transient effects among F1s, how long they would persist in future generations if our between‐population plants backcrossed into the focal populations, and whether these benefits may be counteracted by outbreeding depression as recombination disrupts co‐adapted gene complexes. The answers to these questions are likely to depend on many factors, including the genetic architecture of local adaptation and population size (Willi et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), but fitness declines in subsequent generations are not uncommon after between‐population crosses (Fenster and Galloway 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Johansen‐Morris and Latta 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Novel environments may alter the costs and benefits of outbreeding: increases in variation among individuals might help populations adapt, despite temporary decreases in mean fitness due to outbreeding depression.
