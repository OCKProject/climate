<p class="p">We compiled monthly temperature and precipitation data from 1951 to 1980 for all seed sources, as well as the gardens during the months of the experiment (September 2015 to July 2016) from PRISM (PRISM Climate Group 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). We calculated historic (prewarming, 1951–1980) climate averages for each site, which we compared to conditions experienced by plants during the transplant in our analyses. Our decision to use normals from this time window, rather than a more recent time window, reflects an assumption that populations have been limited in their capacity to adapt to changing conditions, such that historic normals best represent each population's climate optima. However, we note that contemporary normals (1984–2013) are highly correlated with those that we used (September–July temperature:

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), so our choice of time period is unlikely to affect our results. Inter‐annual climate variability was very similar in each of the seed collection sites (data not shown), so we do not further consider variability in climate, and focus on averages only. Pairwise population genetic differentiation (F
