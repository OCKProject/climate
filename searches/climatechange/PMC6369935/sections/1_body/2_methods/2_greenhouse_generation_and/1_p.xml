<p class="p">We grew field‐collected seeds in the greenhouse and implemented a controlled crossing design to generate seeds for the field transplant. We planted maternal families from each population into 22 randomized blocks, with each block containing one family from each population. Two types of crosses were performed: “within‐population” crosses and “between‐population” crosses. For within‐population crosses, dams were pollinated using pollen from the plant of the same population in the subsequent block (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>A). Each plant from each of the 15 populations was therefore used as both a sire and a dam with other plants from the same population. For between‐population crosses, flowers on plants from the two focal populations within each block were pollinated using each of the donor plants in that block (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>B). These crosses simulate an early stage of gene flow: the progeny of a mating event that is the result of long distance pollen dispersal (or the progeny of a cross between a native individual and a recent immigrant). We collected the seeds from crosses as fruits ripened. Further details about our greenhouse conditions and crossing design are in Supporting Information Methods 1.
