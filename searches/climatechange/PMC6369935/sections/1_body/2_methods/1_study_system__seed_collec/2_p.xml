<p class="p">Seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic> were collected from 15 populations in July 2014 (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). We used the two northwestern‐most populations of the continuous distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. pulchella</italic> as common garden sites (hereafter referred to as focal populations). Other populations (hereafter, donor populations) were selected with the goal of sampling representative variation in major climatic axes (temperature, precipitation, and seasonality of these variables; Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>B) across the northern half of the species' range. In each of these populations, seeds were collected haphazardly from plants spaced &gt;0.5 m apart.
