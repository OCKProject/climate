 <italic class="italic">Clarkia pulchella</italic> Pursh (Onagraceae) is a winter annual that grows on sparsely vegetated, south‐facing slopes with low canopy cover throughout eastern Washington and Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana (United States) and southeastern British Columbia (Canada). This species germinates in fall and overwinters as a seedling before flowering in late May, June, and early July. It has no observed seed dormancy, but seeds will not germinate immediately upon dehiscing and require an after‐ripening period of several weeks. It has showy pink flowers and is visited by a diverse array of pollinators, although it has some capacity to self‐pollinate in the absence of pollinators or mates (MacSwain et al.
