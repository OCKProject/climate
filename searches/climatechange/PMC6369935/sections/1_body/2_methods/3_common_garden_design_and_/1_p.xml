<p class="p">For the transplant, we used seeds from 15 of our greenhouse blocks, and substituted seeds from the same type of cross from other greenhouse blocks when they were unavailable from our primary 15. Seeds were glued to toothpicks to expedite planting and monitoring in the field. Two seeds were glued to each toothpick with a tiny dab of water‐soluble glue (when seeds were limited, just one seed was glued to each toothpick). At each of the two sites, toothpicks were planted into 10 fully randomized plots. Each plot contained two toothpicks from each cross type from each of the 15 replicates. We only planted between‐population crosses with local dams at each of the two focal sites (i.e., Blue Lake plots only contained between‐population crosses performed on Blue Lake plants, and Johnstone Creek plots only contained between‐population crosses performed on Johnstone Creek plants). Within‐population crosses from all populations were planted out at both sites. Therefore, each plot contained two replicates of each of 15 crosses from 29 cross types (14 between‐population groups and 15 within‐population groups). For some cross types, less than 15 families had sufficient seeds for the full design, therefore, each plot contained 832 toothpicks at Johnstone Creek and 836 toothpicks at Blue Lake. In total, our design included 16,680 toothpicks and 32,755 seeds. Seeds were planted in September 2015 and watered once in late October, although at that time most seeds that were checked had already begun germinating. Plots were protected with wire cages; further details of transplant installation are in Supporting Information Methods 2.</p>
