<p class="p">Germination was censused 16–20 November 2015. We documented the emergence of either zero, one, or two germinants at each toothpick. If two germinants were present, these were randomly thinned so that just one remained. Overwinter survival was assessed 17–21 March 2016. During both germination and overwinter survival censuses, plant size was measured as the distance in millimeters from the tip of one leaf to the tip of the other (most plants had just one pair of leaves). Further details of monitoring and measuring are provided in Supporting Information Methods 3. In early June 2016, we censused the spring survival of all plants and began measuring reproduction every 2–3 days. As a proxy for seed production, we measured the ovary length of each flower produced on each plant. Pollinators were excluded from our plots to prevent the escape of nonnative alleles so we calibrated a conversion from ovary length to seed production using hand pollinations (linear regression of seed production on ovary length:
