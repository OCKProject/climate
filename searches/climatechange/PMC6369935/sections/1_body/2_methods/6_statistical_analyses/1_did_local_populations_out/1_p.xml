<p class="p">We tested whether local populations were, on average, superior to foreign populations using within‐population crosses only. We compared lifetime fitness of local versus foreign individuals in a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a zero‐inflated negative binomial distribution using the package glmmTMB (Brooks et al. 
 <xref rid="evl391-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). These zero‐inflated models allow specification of fixed effects for both the zero‐inflation part of the model (the probability of a non‐zero value) as well as the conditional part of the model (the effect on the response after accounting for zero‐inflation). Generally, we consider the zero‐inflation part of the model to reflect early lifestages, as the majority of plants that produced zero seeds did so as a result of failing to germinate or survive winter. The conditional part of the model may reflect both differences during reproduction as well as differences among individuals accumulated across all lifestages. In addition to testing for local adaptation represented by lifetime fitness, we tested whether local populations performed better than foreign populations at any component lifestage: germination, size after germination, overwinter survival, size after winter, fruit count, and estimated seed production. Plant size was modeled with a Gaussian response distribution, germination and survival with binomial response distributions and logit link functions, and fruit counts and seed production with zero‐inflated negative binomial response distributions and log link functions. For component lifestage analyses, we included only individuals that had survived to the preceding census and always included plant size at the previous census to account for differences that had accumulated at earlier lifestages. For all of these models, we initially included a random effect structure of block within site, dam within dam population, and sire within sire population. However, models of later lifestages and lifetime fitness frequently failed to converge with this parameterization. When convergence failed, we reduced random effects to only block within site and sire population. Predictions and confidence intervals were visualized with ggeffects (Lüdecke
