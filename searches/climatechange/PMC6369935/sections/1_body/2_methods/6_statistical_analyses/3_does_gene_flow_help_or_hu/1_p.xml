<p class="p">Based on the results of the analyses above, we expected that gene flow from some populations was likely to confer benefits by contributing adaptive genetic variation to focal populations experiencing an anomalous climate. To evaluate whether there were benefits of gene flow that were independent of these climate effects, we calculated the midparent historic temperature average for all individuals (i.e., the average temperature of dam and sire sites) and then calculated the absolute difference between this temperature and the experimental temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). We calculated a metric of absolute midparent precipitation difference (summed over April–July) in the same manner. We used GLMMs as described above to test for an effect of gene flow in addition to an anticipated effect of midparent climate differences on lifetime fitness and each component lifestage. In these models, gene flow was included as a categorical fixed effect (within‐population cross vs. between‐population cross) along with midparent temperature and precipitation differences. We included gene flow and temperature differences in both the conditional and zero‐inflation parts of the lifetime fitness model, and precipitation differences in only the conditional part. We had difficulty disentangling effects of precipitation differences and gene flow (see Results) so we ran these models with and without precipitation differences.
