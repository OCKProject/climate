<p class="p">We examined whether the genetic differentiation (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>) between the two parental populations of the between‐population crosses positively or negatively affected offspring fitness. We could only estimate genetic differentiation between parental populations for individuals with parents from different populations, so in these analyses we use between‐population crosses only. We built zero‐inflated GLMMs as described above using lifetime fitness and included predictors of absolute midparent temperature and precipitation differences as well as F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>. We also tested the effects of these parameters on each component lifestage. Our ability to detect significant effects of climate in full models was limited, likely due to the narrow range of midparent climatic variability across between‐population crosses, so we also built separate models of each of our three predictors on lifetime fitness and each lifestage. All statistical analyses were implemented in R version 3.4.3 (R Core Team
