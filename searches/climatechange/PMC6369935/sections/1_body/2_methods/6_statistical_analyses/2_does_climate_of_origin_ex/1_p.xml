<p class="p">We built GLMMs using the methods described above to evaluate the effects of mismatch between the experiment conditions and populations' historic climates on lifetime fitness and all fitness components, again using only within‐population crosses. We calculated the absolute difference between the garden conditions and the historic temperature and precipitation of each source population. We use absolute differences because we expect that mismatch in either direction along a climate axis will negatively impact fitness. Very few source populations were from sites drier or hotter than conditions during the experiment, so absolute differences mostly result from source populations being historically cooler or wetter than the experiment. Our lifetime fitness model included absolute differences in temperature (for the experiment duration, September–July) in both the conditional and zero‐inflation parts of the model, as well as absolute differences in spring and summer precipitation (April–July) in the conditional part of the model only. We isolated the specific lifestages affected by each of these climatic predictors using the methods described above. In lifestage‐specific analyses, we calculated climate differences using only the months in each census window. In all analyses, all continuous predictors were scaled and centered.</p>
