Populations that were best matched to experimental temperatures performed best in our gardens; lifetime fitness declined with increasing absolute temperature differences between the source and the experimental conditions (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>B), were mismatched from the experiment conditions and performed worse than populations from warmer sites that were more climatically similar to the garden conditions (Supporting Information Analysis 1).
