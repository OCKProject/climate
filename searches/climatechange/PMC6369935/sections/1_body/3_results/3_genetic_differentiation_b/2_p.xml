<p class="p">The negative effect of midparent temperature differences in between‐population crosses is generally consistent with our analyses of climatic drivers of performance in within‐population crosses. Between‐population plants with donor parents that were well‐matched to temperatures during the experiment were more likely to produce seeds, as indicated by the significant negative effect of midparent temperature differences in the zero‐inflation part of that model (Table
