<p class="p">It is important to note that genetic differentiation is not especially correlated with temperature differences (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = –0.25, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> =0.193), although genetic differentiation and precipitation differences are correlated (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.64, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> =0.0003); plants whose parents are more genetically differentiated also have having larger differences between their historic midparent precipitation and conditions during the experiment. We think it is unlikely that the apparent positive effects of genetic differentiation are actually driven by precipitation differences, because we would expect high precipitation differences to negatively affect fitness. The overall weak or absent effects of temperature and precipitation differences in these models may be due to a narrower range of variation in midparent climate for the between‐population crosses relative to the within‐population crosses (Fig.
