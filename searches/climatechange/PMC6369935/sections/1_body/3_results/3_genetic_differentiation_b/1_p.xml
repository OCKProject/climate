<p class="p">Both midparent temperature difference from the garden conditions and genetic differentiation between parental populations had significant effects on fitness (Fig.

Genetic differentiation between parental populations had a positive effect on lifetime fitness via increasing the probability of producing seeds (the zero‐inflation part of the model). The effects of genetic differentiation on lifetime fitness were mirrored in the analyses of single lifestages: F
