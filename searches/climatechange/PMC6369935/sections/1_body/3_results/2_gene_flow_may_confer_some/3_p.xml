<p class="p">A small positive effect of gene flow, independent of climatic differences, is supported by analyses of some lifestage components (Fig.

 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>C). Negative effects of precipitation and temperature differences were similar to those found in the analyses of climatic drivers of performance, while gene flow (i.e., being from a between‐population vs. a within‐population cross) had a positive effect on fruit production and a marginal positive effect on seed production.
