<p class="p">It is difficult to disentangle the effects of precipitation differences from the effects of gene flow in these analyses. This is because our focal populations are already among the driest provenances in our experiment. Therefore, the average between‐population plant is better matched to the experimental conditions than the average within‐population plant, because the midparent precipitation of between‐population plants is always calculated with at least one very dry focal parent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>A). This was not an issue with temperature differences, because our focal populations are intermediate to other provenances in terms of temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="evl391-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>B). When lifetime fitness was analyzed without precipitation differences in the model, we found that gene flow (being a between‐population cross, rather than a within‐population cross), had a positive effect on lifetime fitness in addition to effects of temperature (Table
