 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], because it presents consistent predictive performance compared to other algorithms [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], especially when the number of occurrence points is low [

 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Maxent also resolves truncation issues via a more conservative assumption that is termed ‘clamping’. When a pixel has a value for a given variable outside the range covered by the model (calibration model), is given to that pixel the closest value of the pixel present for that variable in the model [
