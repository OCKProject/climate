<p class="p">Traditionally, the task of choosing the best parameter values has been considered a challenge for these models [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. We used the "ENMeval" package [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] to choose the best parameter values. For each set of variables, 48 models were constructed [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] through the dismo package [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], using the three variables of each set, modeling records (using checkerboard2 for partitioning of occurrence data), maximum background number (10000) and using the following parameter settings: multiplayer regularization values (0.5â€“4.0 with 0.5 intervals), six resource class configurations: L, LQ, H, LQH, LQHP and LQHPT (where L = linear, Q = quadratic, H = hinge, P = product and T = threshold). The Jackknife function of MaxEnt [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] was used to identify the percentage of contribution for each variable. The best model for each set of variables (
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was chosen based on the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) values [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The Akaike information criterion is an important metric in ecological niche modeling [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], but it is necessary to use other statistical criteria to evaluate the performance of the model through independent data [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>].
