<p class="p">Barve et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] emphasized the importance of 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> as the appropriate region through which models should be calibrated. If the fundamental niche extends beyond the environment boundaries represented in 
 <bold class="bold">M,</bold> there may be truncation, which sub-characterizes niches and lead to different sets of problems for model transfer [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Increasing the extent also often includes absences that are more distant environmentally from the presences, but due to the limitations of 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>, makes the model look better than it actually is [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Using a larger study region (
 <bold class="bold">G</bold>') would prone the model to overfit environmental conditions present in the region where the species is known to occur, in situations referred as non-equilibrium distributions [
