<p class="p">The choice of the study area was based on a heuristic structure called 
 <bold class="bold">BAM</bold> [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. 
 <bold class="bold">B</bold> represents the population dynamics (competition, predation, dispute over food or area) in the area where biotic parameters are suitable for the species. Estimation of these parameters would require a dense set of observations over large spatial extensions [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. So we decided to neglect the effects of these biotic interactions on the modeling process. 
 <bold class="bold">A</bold> represents mainly the abiotic conditions that do not depend on the presence or abundance of the species [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This geographic region is the fundamental niche of the species, which can potentially be invaded when both conditions are adequate (
 <bold class="bold">A ∩ B</bold>) but the species has not yet been able to reach is represented by 
 <bold class="bold">G’</bold> [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. It defines the dispersal potential of a species if the barriers are removed [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The parts of the world that have been accessible to the species via dispersal over relevant periods are symbolized by 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The subset of the fundamental niche that is actually represented on relevant landscapes (
 <bold class="bold">A</bold> ∩ 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>) is the occupied area and can be defined as the existing fundamental niche [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Finally, this heuristic scheme then states that stable populations of a species will be found only in the region of intersection of 
 <bold class="bold">B</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">A</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>, (
 <bold class="bold">B</bold> ∩ 
 <bold class="bold">A</bold> ∩ 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
