<p class="p">We submit these variables to two PCAs (supplementary material) to identify: (1) which variables have greater importance to the model (r &gt; 6), excluding those with little relevance (r &lt; 6), and leaving a set of seven climatic variables (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211171.s002" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref>); (2) how many variables, from the seven remaining, explain 100% of the environmental space of 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>. The second PCA showed that it is possible to explain more than 99% of the environmental space of 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> using only three variables (
