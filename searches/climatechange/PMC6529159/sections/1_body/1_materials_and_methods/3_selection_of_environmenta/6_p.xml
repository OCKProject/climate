<p class="p">We used Mobility-Oriented Parity (MOP), available at the “ntbox” package [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], to identify areas of strict extrapolation and also to calculate the environmental similarity between the calibration and projection regions (
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">G’</bold>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Only five of the seven climatic variables available at Bio-oracle had environmental similarities between 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> and the same region of 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> in 
 <bold class="bold">G’</bold>.
