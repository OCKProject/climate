<p class="p">Although the use of AUC-ROC for model evaluation is not questioned herein [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], we additionally used the partial ROC (AUCratio) to choose the best model. AUCratio is an independent cutoff threshold metric where significant values are above 1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The AUCratio is a ratio between the predicted model AUC and null expectation [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] that a model generated with random data does not have a better prediction than the models generated with the input data [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. We calculated the ratio of AUCrandon (at level of 0.5) and the AUCatual (calibrating 5% of omission and 1000 bootstrap interactions) using the predicted distribution model [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] and evaluation records, through the package "ntbox" v.0.2.5.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] for Rstudio [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], to ensure greater robustness in model analysis [
