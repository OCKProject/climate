<p class="p">The Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) is the most common metric to evaluate the accuracy of models [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. AUC values â‰¤ 0.5 indicate that the model failed to perform better than random expectations, whereas values close to 1 indicate a good performance of the model [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. In practice, the AUC-ROC is calculated based on a series of trapezoids [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], with the curve essentially "connecting the points" representing the different thresholds of the prediction [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. This approach is used when input data is partitioned, in this case into training and test data [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. When biotic data are divided into presence and absence (background), the AUC measures the discriminatory ability of the model to correctly predict the origin of these data if randomly selected [
