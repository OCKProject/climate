<p class="p">The distribution of marine organisms, including corals, is determined by interactions of physical, chemical and biological factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Based on that, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) approaches can provide information on the potential distribution of species within specific study areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. SDMs associate environmental or spatial data to a set of distributional informationâ€™s, such as distribution records [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], adopting the general thesis that the best indicator of a species climatic requirements is its current distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Based on that, models indicate the environmental conditions in which a given species may occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], also indicating the most suitable areas for its occurrence [

 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Modern SDMs studies began with BIOCLIM (the first SDM package), which became available in January 1984 [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and are broadly applied to: prevent marine bioinvasions [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], conservation management planning [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and especially to studies on climate changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], predicting possible shifts on geographical distributions of key species [
