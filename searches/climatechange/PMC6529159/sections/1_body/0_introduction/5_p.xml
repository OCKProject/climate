<p class="p">The SDMs also can be used to calculate the relative adequacy of a given habitat occupied by a species and to estimate changes in such suitability over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In the present study, we applied SDMs to generate maps of Current Potential Habitat (CPH) and Future Potential Habitat (FPH) for

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> by the end of the 21st century. These maps indicate potentially suitable areas and estimate habitat gains and losses in the different climatic scenarios projected. The projections will serve as tools for management plans and reef conservation in the southwestern Atlantic reefs.
