<p class="p">In the Southwestern Atlantic, coastal reef communities occur along of 3000 km of the Brazilian coastline [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], showing high endemism of reef-building species [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Four of those endemic species belong to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mussismilia</italic>, commonly known as brain-corals [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Although molecular assessments on 
 <italic class="italic">Mussismilia</italic> are still rare [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], the distinctiveness among species is well established, allowing rapid identification in the field [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The genus has at least two species in risk of extinction: 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">braziliensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The first is restricted to shallow reefs of Bahia State and Abrolhos reefs, whereas the latter is found from the coast of Ceará to Espírito Santo States (from -3.822 to -18.0480 latitude).
