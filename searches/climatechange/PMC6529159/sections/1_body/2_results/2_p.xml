<p class="p">The maximum training sensitivity plus specificity cloglog threshold used to generate the binary maps maximized the sensitivity and specificity of the model [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. This threshold is best suited for studies on rare or endangered species [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], as it reduces the over-prediction rate and selects only areas with high environmental suitability [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The thresholds of CPH (0.314) and FPH (RCP 4.5–00.314 and RCP 8.5–0.241) show that a random prediction in a fraction of the same area does not have a better prediction than the points used in the test step [
