<p class="p">Even showing wide depth ranges, connectivity between coral populations is not always continuous along bathymetric gradients [

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> would serve as genetic stocks for shallow waters, as most of its deep records are sparse and rare [

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic>, regardless of the maintenance of coastal populations. In case of connectivity, such refugia would contribute for the recolonization of the coastal zone affected.
