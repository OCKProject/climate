<p class="p">Most of the current suitable distribution area for 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> (CPH) is south of the São Francisco river, where most published records are concentrated. Despite records in the coast of the Espírito Santo State (~ 19ºS) were not used in our analyses, that area is known as the southernmost distribution limit for the species [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>], with the highest percentage of CPH. That region coincides with a center of diversity within the Brazilian Province (20°S to 23°S), as indicated for benthic organisms, such as algae, invertebrates and fishes [

 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. That center is favored by the confluence of currents in the Brazilian coast, creating a transition zone between tropical and subtropical diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Despite a limited number of records of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> and a smaller percentage of CPH to the north of the São Francisco River, the species is the main reef-builder northwards the São Francisco river [
