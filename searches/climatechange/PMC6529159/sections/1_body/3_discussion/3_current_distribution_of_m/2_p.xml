 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>] and consequently close to the coast. However, scattered records show this species occupying deeper reefs (up to 25 m) [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] and even at mesophotic depths [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Similarly, most of the CPH is concentrated in shallow waters (0–20 m), but with deeper suitable habitats commonly occurring, especially in the southern portion of species distribution. Most of current records of the species are within the Abrolhos Bank, in the East coast of Brazil (16°40′ – 19°40′S and 37°20′ – 39°10′ W), which harbour on of the most rich na extensive coral reef system in the South Atlantic [

 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. The area is composed by a mosaic of protected areas, as well as several distinct environments, such as biogenic reefs, euphotic and mesophotic reefs and rhodolith beds [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. The records are mainly concentrated in the shallow areas of the bank, but some came from southern deeper reefs, between 12 and 25 m (Espírito Santo State), a less studied area [
