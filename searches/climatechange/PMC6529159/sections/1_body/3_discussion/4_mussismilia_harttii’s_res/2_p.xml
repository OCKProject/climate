 <xref rid="pone.0211171.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Thus, in a future scenario, the species would lose suitable habitats in coastal shallow sectors, followed by a gain of deeper habitats, which could serve as refugia in face of climate changes, if other environmental conditions such as luminosity, salinity and others are favorable [
