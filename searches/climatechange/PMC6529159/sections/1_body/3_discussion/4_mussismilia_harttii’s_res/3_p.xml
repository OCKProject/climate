 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> outside the 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> region in the two future scenarios, such as the northern coast of South America and the southern coast of Brazil, may be inaccessible due to geographic barriers for coral dispersion. These include colder water masses in the region of Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro), to the south [

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> within the 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> region are mostly concentrated in the Abrolhos Bank, which might serve as refuge areas in future climate change scenarios.
