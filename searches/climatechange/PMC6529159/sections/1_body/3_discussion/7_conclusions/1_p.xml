<p class="p">This research showed the efficiency of SDMs to predict areas with potential habitat to

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> in the present scenario and in two future scenarios for the end of the 21st century. The results showed a significant reduction of the area with potential habitat for the species. The largest area of the FPH for

 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> is concentrated in deeper waters, especially within the Abrolhos bank, one of the most important areas for biodiversity conservation in the South Atlantic [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Despite having several protected areas, Abrolhos still suffers anthropic impacts, which tend to increase in the next decades, by activities such as port expansion, overfishing, mining and oil/gas extraction. Therefore, it is essential to ensure viable refuges not only for the endangered 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic>, but for all Brazilian coral species, given the expected climate change scenarios. Thus, an expansion of protective measures focused on mesophotic reefs, especially in the Abrolhos Bank, is essential and urgent.
