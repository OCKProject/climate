<p class="p">Another important factor is the competition with algae (macroalgae and filamentous algae). These organisms dominate Brazilian benthic communities on reefs down to 15 m deep [

 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. Thus, in future scenarios, algae will likely continue to be favored, and its competition with corals tends to reduce coverage of the later in shallow waters. In contrast, besides less light availability, deeper areas would be less susceptible to the influence of runoff, temperature and salinity changes. Despite the lack of earlier baselines for Brazilian benthic communities, it is possible to affirm that the current scenario is result of a sum of anthropic impacts, as studies back in the 1960â€™s describe distinctive zonation and coverage in these communities [
