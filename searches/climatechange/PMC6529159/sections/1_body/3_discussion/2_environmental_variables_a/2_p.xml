 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> were mostly influenced by current velocity, bathymetry and temperature, respectively. Nutrient uptake in coral reefs is directly affected by current speeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>], which shape their distribution in both shallow and deep waters [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. The 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> area is under the influence of the Brazilian and the North Brazilian Current [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Studies on genetic connectivity with the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mussismilia</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hispida</italic>) showed that these currents may consist in a barrier to coral dispersal [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. In shallow reefs, currents cause constant sediment resuspension, which influences the coverage and composition of benthic organisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>], changing the visibility of water [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>], influencing the microbial community of corals [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] and the behavior of the coral larvae during the nesting phase [
 <xref rid="pone.0211171.ref110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. Considering that most records of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> result from shallow reefs, it is expected that the species is rather influenced by sediment resuspension. Despite Brazilian corals as a whole are resistant to the input of terrigenous sediments and to relatively turbid waters 101], 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">harttii</italic> has preference for clear waters, in which it is more abundant [
