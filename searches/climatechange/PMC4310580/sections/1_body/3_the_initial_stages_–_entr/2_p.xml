<p class="p">Much of the understanding required to reduce the rates of unintentional introductions is concerned with improving knowledge of the pathways and vectors of invasion (Hulme 
 <xref rid="b145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Preventing an invasion is the most cost-effective way of dealing with it (Simberloff et al. 
 <xref rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). These pathways and vectors are now becoming much better understood across a range of activities in different areas, and for different organisms (e.g. Drake and Lodge 
 <xref rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Tatem and Hay 
 <xref rid="b285" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Huiskes et al. 
 <xref rid="b144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Changing human traffic patterns in tandem with changing climates (including their variability) is likely to change substantially the sites of entrainment risk for any given location (Tatem 
 <xref rid="b284" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In consequence, although something of an invasion cycle exists, where disturbed entrainment areas tend to harbour similar suites of species (Lee and Chown 
 <xref rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), forecasting which species and areas to prioritize for surveillance may be difficult because of rapidly changing environments and species distributions. Ongoing invasion of source areas (see e.g. Roy et al. 
 <xref rid="b251" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) may likewise mean changing risk profiles. Genomic approaches offer a powerful tool to help manage these risks.
