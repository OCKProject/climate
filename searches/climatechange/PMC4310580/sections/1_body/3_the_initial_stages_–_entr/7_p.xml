<p class="p">Although barcoding and metabarcoding approaches are increasingly being applied to the detection of invasives and have been used in several successful detections (e.g. Dejean et al. 
 <xref rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Collins et al. 
 <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Egan et al. 
 <xref rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Takahara et al. 
 <xref rid="b283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), they could also be used to reduce risks of introduction by understanding the composition of species in source hot spots. While doing so might at first seem impracticable, reductions in costs of the technical methods (Lemmon et al. 
 <xref rid="b174" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Rocha et al. 
 <xref rid="b247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), and routine surveillance of areas for incoming species (e.g. Bourlat et al. 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), which are often the same sources for outgoing ones (Lee and Chown 
 <xref rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), mean that the data may become increasingly available for species detection. The main barriers to overcome are making sure that sequence information, biological records and distributional data are available in linked and readily useable forms [although their downstream use also faces a variety of challenges (Amano and Sutherland 
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>)], achieving interoperability among the various approaches and information databases, and estimating the extent of errors of omission and commission for various taxa (Collins and Cruickshank 
 <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). While these barriers are high, they are being reduced by increasing discussions among major data providers and ongoing work to improve interoperability. Although this provider approach is important, good practice by investigators (such as coherence in data submitted to major providers) is probably the most significant way to reduce barriers. DNA barcoding approaches may be especially helpful where changing climates encourage change in human agricultural and business practices, creating rapidly changing invasion scenarios.
