<p class="p">The introduction of alien species is either intentional, usually for economic benefit of some form, or unintentional, owing to the fact that species move around in all kinds of ways and include human vectors and human-mediated pathways in their dispersal portfolio (Hulme et al. 
 <xref rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). For intentional introductions, understanding entrainment risk amounts to investigating the socio-political motivations for introducing new species. These are many and diverse and, through time, have ranged from agriculture and horticulture, which are ongoing (Dehnen-Schmutz 
 <xref rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), to the activities of acclimatization societies (Cassey et al. 
 <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). In the nineteenth century, acclimatization societies were established to ‘improve’ what were considered impoverished biotas in newly colonized regions (e.g. North America, New Zealand and Australia) through the importation of plants, birds and mammals, typically from Europe, but also from other regions. Investigations of survival during transport belong in the realm either of plant propagation and animal husbandry, or maintenance of biocontrol agents (e.g. Teshler et al. 
 <xref rid="b289" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). While these areas may have much to inform the investigation of biological invasions and their evolutionary dynamics (e.g. Vorsino et al. 
 <xref rid="b307" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), we will not consider them here. Rather, our emphasis is on unintentional introductions.
