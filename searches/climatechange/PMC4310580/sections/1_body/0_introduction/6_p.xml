<p class="p">Here, we focus on the use of genomics to understand the changing form of invasion with climate change. We briefly review the contributions that genetic and evolutionary approaches have already made, discuss recent technological developments and then highlight further potential of this approach. We base our overview on the unified framework for biological invasions (Blackburn et al. 
 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), recognizing that each of the stages in the invasion process can be mitigated by an accompanying management response (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, although various views exist about how invasive species should be defined (Pyšek et al. 
 <xref rid="b228" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Valéry et al. 
 <xref rid="b299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), here, to avoid uncertainty (McGeoch et al. 
 <xref rid="b190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), we adopt the definition provided by Richardson et al. (
 <xref rid="b241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In consequence, we are concerned with the processes by which species are transported outside their natural range through direct or indirect anthropogenic intervention and become established, proliferate and interact with the biota in their new ranges.
