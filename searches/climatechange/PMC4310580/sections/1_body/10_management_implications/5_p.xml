<p class="p">However, genomics tools promise much more than ways of simply improving detection and an understanding of spread. High-density markers provide a way of tracking changes in different parts of the genome, essential for understanding hybridization and introgression as well as adaptation under climate change including the application of quantitative genomic approaches to identify regions with candidate genes (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>). This can be used to understand the roles of various evolutionary processes at key steps of the invasion pathway, and the ways in which climate change will interact with the latter. Key areas include investigation of evolutionary change underpinning increased competitive ability and enemy release, especially in a biological control context. Genomics methods can also help redirect resources by improving understanding of the burden of invasion, an especially important role as that burden increases (e.g. Pfenninger et al. 
 <xref rid="b216" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). They can assist with rehabilitation in the case where substantial invasive impacts result in widespread ecosystem changes, by understanding patterns of resistance and identifying resistant genotypes that can persist into the future. For example, where trees are affected by introduced pathogens, there is the possibility of identifying tree genotypes that survive outbreaks (Stukely and Crane 
 <xref rid="b278" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>; McKinney et al. 
 <xref rid="b191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). As information becomes available on adaptive changes in traits controlling the spread and climate change adaptation, it should also be possible to refine models about the non-native range of an invasive species. For instance, Kearney et al. (
