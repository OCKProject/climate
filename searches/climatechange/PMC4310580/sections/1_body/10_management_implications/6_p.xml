<p class="p">In summary, genomic tools are proving to be extremely useful for managing invasive species. While they may be seen as costly for less well-resourced nations, several studies have demonstrated that they are more cost-effective than traditional surveillance tools and other methods. Moreover, technology is now advancing to the stage where users do not need to be familiar with its intricacies (in much the same way, most mobile phone users could not build one), and substantial programmes of technology assistance are in place through various international agencies (such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research,

In consequence, the myriad ways genomic tools can be utilized will enable society to contain the economic cost of biological invasions accentuated by climate change, and prevent a world dominated by weedy species.
