<p class="p">The broad consensus in the literature is that climate change is likely to interact synergistically with biological invasions, leading to increasing economic and biodiversity impact (Walther et al. 
 <xref rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Scholes et al. 
 <xref rid="b259" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Much evidence exists for recent changes in pest and disease distributions (Bebber et al. 
 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), although substantial variation exists among taxa and geographic regions in the extent to which an overall increase in the burden of invasives under climate change might be expected (Bellard et al. 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). A complicating factor is that human activity in the form of trade, transport and adaptation to climate change is likely to increase too. This will complicate decisions about range shifts relative to anthropogenic introductions and thus potentially confounding management decisions that are required to limit the overall burden of invasive species impacts. Even in relatively remote areas, these problems are playing out (Chown et al. 
 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Overall, the prospects are for increased impacts of invasion as climate change proceeds (Scholes et al. 
 <xref rid="b259" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
