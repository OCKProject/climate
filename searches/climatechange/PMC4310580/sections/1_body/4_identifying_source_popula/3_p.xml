<p class="p">Understanding source populations and spread dynamics may benefit from using nuclear and extranuclear genomes. For instance, in the Russian wheat aphid, Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="b333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) tested patterns of invasion by characterizing more than 500 clones for genetic markers in nuclear DNA, mtDNA and endosymbionts. They were able to show that Turkey and Syria were the most likely sources of invasion to Kenya and South Africa respectively, as well as establishing patterns of invasion into the New World. Having the different sources of genomic information was essential to this study as the recent introduction limited the genetic resolution of the aphid markers used. Combining nuclear DNA and organellar markers has traditionally improved the understanding of invasive processes, and it is becoming clear that including vertically transmitted endosymbiont or parasitic organisms can provide new insight into the origins of invasive species as well as the diseases they carry (Gupta et al.

 <xref rid="b197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The addition of mtDNA provides information on introgression patterns between diverged populations or subspecies because mtDNA genomes track maternal lineages (McCormick et al.
