<p class="p">Genomic tools can help in identifying the consequences of these processes because they can be followed across different parts of the genome. This applies particularly to plants where invasive taxa often arise as hybrids (Moody and Les 
 <xref rid="b199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Ainouche et al. 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Schierenbeck and Ellstrand 
 <xref rid="b256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). One famous case is of the damaging riparian invasive 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> species in the USA. The main invasive lineage arose from hybridization between two introduced species, 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. ramosissima</italic>, which have largely separate ranges with some overlap in Asia, but do not appear to hybridize there (Gaskin and Schaal 
 <xref rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Genome-wide neutral markers revealed that hybrids dominate the invasive range, and the level of introgression is strongly correlated with latitude (Gaskin and Kazmer 
 <xref rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). A corresponding latitudinal cline in cold hardiness suggests that hybridization may have contributed to the rapid adaptation of 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> to climatic extremes in North America (Friedman et al. 
 <xref rid="b110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). In reed canarygrass, multiple introductions into North America of genetic material from different European regions have mitigated the impact of genetic bottlenecks (Lavergne and Molofsky 
 <xref rid="b165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). This species has higher genetic diversity and heritable phenotypic variation in its invasive range relative to its native range. Comparisons of neutral differentiation (

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>) to differentiation in quantitative traits among populations (
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>) provide evidence for rapid selection of genotypes with greater vegetative colonization ability and phenotypic plasticity in the introduced range.
