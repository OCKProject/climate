<p class="p">Whole-genome and reduced-representation genomic approaches are invaluable for detecting hybridization, and more powerful than any other method to quantify the extent of introgression of genomic material and (potentially) functional genes involved in environmental tolerance and invasiveness. They have been used to estimate rates and genomic extent of hybridization (Larson et al. 
 <xref rid="b163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Parchman et al. 
 <xref rid="b213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and identify the potential for genetic swamping, or hybrid incompatibilities that may be deleterious to native species (Fitzpatrick et al. 
 <xref rid="b104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Applying genetic and genomic methods to recent polyploids poses extra challenges due to the presence of multiple genome and gene copies; this can complicate short-read alignment and 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembly of genomes, but can also be useful in establishing patterns of relatedness among species and populations (Griffin et al. 
 <xref rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Reference genomes are especially valuable tools in these cases and are helping to reveal within-species diversity and hybrid origins of polyploids (e.g. Evans et al. 
 <xref rid="b100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Marcussen et al. 
 <xref rid="b184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), and reduced-representation library methods can now be applied even without a reference genome (Lu et al. 
 <xref rid="b181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Genomic studies of several plant groups are pointing to porous species barriers across thousands of years where ongoing hybridization and gene flow between species is present despite species maintaining their morphological integrity (e.g. De La Torre et al. 
 <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Griffin and Hoffmann 
 <xref rid="b124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such a dynamic process of hybridization and polyploidy may also occur among different chromosomal races within a species as in the case of buffel grass, which is weedy and invasive in some areas of its current range and consists of different polyploids that vary in their environmental distributions and invasiveness (Kharrat-Souissi et al. 
 <xref rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
