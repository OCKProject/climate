<p class="p">Hybridization can act as a stimulus to invasion (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck 
 <xref rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Schierenbeck and Ellstrand 
 <xref rid="b256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) and occurs on a continuum from the combining of largely reproductively isolated genomes to the mixing of distinct populations within a species. Hybridization offers many potential advantages during invasion. It may increase adaptive potential through the injection of genetic variation and the formation of beneficial gene combinations (Anderson 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1948</xref>). Hybridization is known to result in transgressive segregation, where phenotypic variation in the hybrids exceeds that of the parents (Rieseberg et al. 
 <xref rid="b242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). In sunflowers and Louisiana irises, there are particularly compelling cases for hybridization facilitating the colonization of novel habitats (Rieseberg et al. 
 <xref rid="b242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b243" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Arnold et al.
