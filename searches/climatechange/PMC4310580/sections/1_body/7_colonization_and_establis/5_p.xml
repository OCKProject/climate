<p class="p">Polyploidy has occurred frequently in the evolutionary history of angiosperms, often associated with hybridization events (Wood et al. 
 <xref rid="b319" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). There are several examples of recently derived invasive polyploids (Ainouche et al. 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Schierenbeck and Ellstrand 
 <xref rid="b256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; te Beest et al. 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and polyploidy is over-represented among alien plant taxa (e.g. Pandit et al. 
 <xref rid="b212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Polyploidy is associated with several advantages (reviewed in Otto and Whitton 
 <xref rid="b211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Comai 
 <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Otto 
 <xref rid="b210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; te Beest et al. 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) that could aid in invasion, including pre-adapting species to the environmental conditions in the new range (e.g. Henery et al. 
 <xref rid="b134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), masking deleterious alleles (Otto and Whitton 
 <xref rid="b211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Otto 
 <xref rid="b210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), restoring fertility through chromosome doubling (e.g. Ainouche et al. 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) or through changes to the reproductive system to that contribute to colonization ability (e.g. Robertson et al. 
 <xref rid="b246" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, allopolyploids benefit from fixed heterozygosity due to the combining of divergent parental genomes. This feature may have contributed to the evolutionary success of polyploids over diploids in the Arctic enabling them to survive dramatic shifts in climate (Brochmann et al. 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>).
