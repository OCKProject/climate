<p class="p">Recent work has continued to reinforce the notion that evolutionary genetic changes in invasive species can be rapid and often involve responses to climate. For instance, purple loosestrife, 
 <italic class="italic">Lythrum salicaria,</italic> has invaded wetlands across an introduced range that covers a latitudinal gradient extending in eastern North America from 39°N to 48.5°N. Along this gradient, Colautti and Barrett (
 <xref rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) showed an adaptive cline in flowering time, with earlier flowering at the northern invasion front, where it increases survival and fruit set, but with selection against earlier flowering in the south where it decreases vegetative growth. Climate adaptation involving changes in flowering traits has been recorded in several other invasive plant species (Moran and Alexander 
 <xref rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Evolution of traits in response to climate in invasive species has also been found for a range of animals. In 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila subobscura</italic>, introduced into Chile in the late 1970s, evolutionary divergence in thermal preferences among populations from different climates has weakened clines in chromosomal inversion (Castañeda et al. 
 <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Likewise, physiological tolerances appear to have diverged in response to climate in the mite 
 <italic class="italic">Halotydeus destructor</italic> (Hill et al. 
 <xref rid="b137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Several researchers have argued that evolution in invasive species can provide general answers to questions of whether species will be able to adapt to rapid climate change (Moran and Alexander 
 <xref rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), including those about the speed of evolutionary change, the specific nature of the change that has occurred and factors that might limit evolutionary change.
