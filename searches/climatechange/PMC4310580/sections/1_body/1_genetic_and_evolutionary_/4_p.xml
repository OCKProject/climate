<p class="p">These types of studies are now being supplemented with a range of genomic and transcriptomic approaches that are providing answers to questions about the origins of invasive populations at a new level of resolution, providing new ways of monitoring for invasive organisms, and leading to an understanding of the nature of the changes that underlie adaptive shifts. We consider the promise provided by these studies within the context of detecting and managing biological invasions as climate change proceeds, and within a framework of the different steps involved in detecting and responding to an invader, understanding its source, and then tracking its impact on the surroundings (Fig.
