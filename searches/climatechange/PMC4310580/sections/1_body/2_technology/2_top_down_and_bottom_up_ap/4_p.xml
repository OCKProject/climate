<p class="p">Although there have been few studies that have applied these approaches to identify genes important for adaptation during invasion, the growth of genomic data in nonmodel organisms suggest that these methods will soon be commonplace for invasive species. As strong selection will be required to see evolutionary changes over short time scales, theory suggests that large-effect loci (Yeaman and Whitlock 
 <xref rid="b323" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) or perhaps clusters of adaptive loci may be more likely to underlie a rapid response to selection. However, genetic changes from standing variation as opposed to new mutations are likely to be essential for adaptation during invasion, due to the waiting time required for new mutations (Barrett and Schluter 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Prentis etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="b225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). This suggests that polygenic adaptation from standing variation present in the original introduction is likely, so adaptation through multiple loci of small effect may also play an important role in the invasion. Both empirical and theoretical studies are needed to determine which features of the genetic architecture of rapid adaptation, if any, might distinguish it from longer-term adaptive evolution and if differences in genetic architecture could impact the propensity of organisms to become invasive and/or rapidly adapt to continuing climate change.
