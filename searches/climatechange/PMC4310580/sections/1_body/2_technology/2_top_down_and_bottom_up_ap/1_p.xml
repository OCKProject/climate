<p class="p">Ecological and landscape genomics are approaches that incorporate information about the phenotype, genotype and the local environment to make inferences about the loci involved in local adaptation. ‘Bottom-up’ approaches use the genomic signatures of selection to identify loci likely important for adaptation and do not rely on phenotypic information (Wright and Gaut 
 <xref rid="b320" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Several different methods are used, such as tests examining the site frequency spectrum or the extent of linkage disequilibrium, which can indicate the location of a recent selective sweep (Smith and Haigh 
 <xref rid="b269" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Thornton et al. 
 <xref rid="b293" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The popular

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> outlier method identifies regions of the genome under divergent selection by determining which sites have strong differentiation among populations relative to the entire genome or a set of putatively neutrally evolving loci (Lewontin and Krakauer 
 <xref rid="b176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1973</xref>; Beaumont and Nichols 
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Foll and Gaggiotti 
 <xref rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Steane et al. 
 <xref rid="b275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Another approach involves identifying associations between alleles and the local environment, while controlling for population structure, to make inferences about local adaptation (e.g. Coop et al. 
 <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Günther and Coop 
 <xref rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Many of these tests of selection could be applied to invasive species to identify the genes associated with adaptation during invasion and in responses to climate change. These methods are appealing because genes under selection during invasion can be identified without 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> identification of specific functional traits and do not require common garden experiments. However, the loci identified may only be in linkage disequilibrium with the functional site(s). Moreover, population structure can hinder the ability of these tests to correctly identify adaptive loci, and certain demographic scenarios, particularly those involving nonequilibrium conditions, have been shown to generate a large number of false positives (Lotterhos and Whitlock 
 <xref rid="b180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). A critical assessment of how complicated invasion histories, including founder events and genetic admixture, might impact the ability of these methods to detect loci under very recent divergent selection has not yet been conducted, but these processes could represent an impediment to the successful implementation of these tests in some invasive species.
