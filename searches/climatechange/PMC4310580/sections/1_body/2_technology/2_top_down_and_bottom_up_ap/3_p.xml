<p class="p">Top-down and bottom-up approaches each have their own advantages and disadvantages (Wright and Gaut

 <xref rid="b272" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), suggesting that tackling the problem from both ends will often yield the most useful results. However, there are biases common to all these methods that may obscure the genetic architecture of adaptation during invasion, or to climate change signals (Moran and Alexander 
 <xref rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, detecting small effect loci underlying polygenic traits has been a major challenge regardless of the method applied (Pritchard et al. 
 <xref rid="b226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Le Corre and Kremer 
 <xref rid="b167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Well-powered QTL and GWAS studies appear to be an effective solution to this problem (Bloom et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), and new analytical methods that attempt to integrate information from GWAS with allele frequency data from many populations are providing a powerful way to identify the signal of local adaptation in polygenic traits (Turchin et al.
