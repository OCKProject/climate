<p class="p">An important feature of invasive species for evolutionary studies is that the introduction and spread of the invader is often documented (Baker 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1974</xref>), and in many cases, this includes historic collections. Genomic studies are benefiting from increased progress in obtaining information from specimens stored in herbariums, museum collections or recovered from natural repositories such as sediment layers in lake bottoms (Krehenwinkel and Tautz 
 <xref rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Martin et al. 
 <xref rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such studies are particularly applicable to invasive organisms that are often represented well in collections with longitudinal sampling. These specimen records often cover periods over which populations have been exposed to relatively rapid climate change (such as between 1970 and 2000) (Hansen et al. 
 <xref rid="b132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). More formal approaches are also now being applied to secure the preservation of material across time, such as the resurrection initiative for plants (Franks et al. 
 <xref rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
