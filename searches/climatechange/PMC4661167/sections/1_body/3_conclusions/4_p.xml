<p class="p">The institutional capacity of the cantons has the largest contribution to the formation of the composite indicator. Though we did not observe significant differences across the vulnerability categories, we argue that the availability of environmental- and climate-change-related policies improve the adaptive capacity. These policies serve to anticipate the impacts of climate change and form potential responses. However, this indicator does not capture the nature and extent of those policies. For this we use as a proxy the funds per capita allocated to environmental protection. Results showed that there is a wide variation in the less vulnerable category, thus we cannot reach a conclusion that funds are significantly larger for the cantons in this category. However, getting allocation of funds in general from the central government is often the outcome of an intense lobbying process that depends on the relative economic and political importance of each canton. As the less vulnerable category includes some of Ecuador’s largest cantons (e.g. Guayaquil and Quito) along with others that are much smaller (e.g. Mejía and Marcelino Maridueña), we argue that correcting by economy and population size, both institutional capabilities and greater funds for environmental development can determine whether a canton is less vulnerable to climate change.</p>
