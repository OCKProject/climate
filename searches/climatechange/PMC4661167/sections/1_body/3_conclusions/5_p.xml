<p class="p">Earlier work has shown that variables such as the proportion of households with sewage treatment service, with garbage collection service, and with access to water through piped system indicate both poverty levels and development (Baker

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2002</xref>). Thus, we found that those cantons in the least vulnerable category are also those with higher coverage of these public services. In addition, the proportion of population working in agriculture, hunting or fisheries and the proportion of households on owning agricultural land are associated with local economic capabilities and opportunities. Results show that these indicators are among the ten largest contributions to the composite indicator. That is, vulnerability in Ecuador is also influenced by the concentration of economic activities related to agriculture, which limits other economic activities and the ability of people to shift in response to reduced agricultural income that may result from adverse climatic conditions. Some implications of these results arise: first, land tenure promotes economic development and reduces vulnerability as economic deprivation, in an adverse climatic event, is partially resolved by selling land assets. In addition, as agricultural work does not necessarily demand academic qualifications or schooling, this affects human capital accumulation and implies reduced adaptive capacity.
