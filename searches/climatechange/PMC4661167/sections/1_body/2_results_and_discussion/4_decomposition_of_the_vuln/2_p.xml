<p class="p">The cantons with the highest exposure are also located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, in the Midwest in the province of Manabi, and along the Amazonian region. The least exposed cantons are located mainly in the North and Central Regions of Ecuador, and Guayaquil, and some others to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. The coastal zone is highly exposed, in particular, to the tropical monsoon climate (TMC), which extends to the Andean and Amazonian region. This climate pattern is regulated by atmospheric circulation and influences the seasonal changes of wind intensity and direction. Wind transports heat and moisture from the sea and produces variable effects in the Andean region. In addition, as a result of the elevation gradient of the Andean mountains the exposure of cantons in the Amazonian region is relatively low.</p>
