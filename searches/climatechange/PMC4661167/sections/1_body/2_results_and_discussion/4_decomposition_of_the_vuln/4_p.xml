<p class="p">An implication from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> is that the ordering from the composite indicator is not preserved for all components. For instance, although Quito is ranked as one of the least vulnerable cantons, because of its high adaptive capacity and low sensitivity, it is identified as highly exposed to climatic features. The same applies to Guayaquil, which is very highly exposed to climate but is one of the least vulnerable cantons in the country. On the other hand, a canton such as Sozoranga, which is in the less sensitive and very highly adaptive capacity categories, is ranked as one of those less exposed to climatic features. Similarly, Rumiñahui, a canton with very low sensitivity and high adaptive capacity, is highly exposed to climate.
