Cantons with the lowest adaptive capacity are located in the Northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas; in the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabí and Guayas; and in the East, in the Amazonian provinces of Orellana and Pastaza. In turn, the cantons with very high adaptive capacity are Quito, Guayaquil, and Machala, where some of the surrounding cantons also belong to the very high adaptive capacity category.
