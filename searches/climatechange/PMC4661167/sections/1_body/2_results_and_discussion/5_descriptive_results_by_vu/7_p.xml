<p class="p">Regarding the sensitivity indicators, adult illiteracy rate is significantly higher in the very highly vulnerable category (13.12 %), and lower in the less vulnerable (4.99 %) and moderately vulnerable (8.75 %) categories. For the remaining categories, the illiteracy rate averages 10.01 %. For crowded households, this proportion is lowest for the less vulnerable category (14.19 %) and is significantly different for the rest of the vulnerability categories (highly vulnerable 23.33 % and very highly vulnerable, 27.93 %). Population density is significantly larger in the less vulnerable category (180 inhabitants per square km) compared with the very highly vulnerable category. However, there is a high variation where no pattern is identified and confidence intervals overlap across all categories.</p>
