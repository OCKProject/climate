<p class="p">In the category of moderately vulnerable cantons we find that Quevedo, Latacunga, and Babahoyo (where population size is at least 153,000 inhabitants) are not different, in terms of vulnerability, from other much smaller cantons such as Calvas (pop. 28,185), Macara (pop. 19,018), San Pedro de Huaca (pop. 7624), and Chaguarpamba (7161). This indicates that there is no clear pattern between population size and vulnerability to climate change. In the category of vulnerable cantons we find Portoviejo (pop. 280,029), which is one of the 10 most populated cantons in the country, as well as smaller cantons like Guaranda (pop. 25,001), Salinas (pop. 28,650), and Quilanga (pop. 4337).</p>
