 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the calculated weights of each indicator, that is, their contribution to the formation of the composite vulnerability indicators. The largest weight corresponds to the institutional capacity. For the relative ordering we observe that the climatic indicators are among the ten with the largest contributions. Temperature has the second largest contribution, then wind velocity has the third, relative humidity the sixth; and, precipitation the tenth. Other indicators with large contributions are the proportion of households with sewage treatment service; the proportion of households with garbage collection service; the proportion of population working in agriculture, hunting or fisheries; the proportion of households owning agricultural land; and, the proportion of households receiving water through a pipe system.
