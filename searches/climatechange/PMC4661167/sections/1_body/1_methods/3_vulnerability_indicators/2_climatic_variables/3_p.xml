<p class="p">Four climatic indices were constructed to describe the trends of the climatic variables. The dataset was divided into two regions: western Ecuador (coastal zone) and eastern Ecuador (the Inter-Andean and Amazon regions). Thus, we implemented the EOF for the monthly variation of each climatic variable at canton level, except for precipitation, where we used the yearly averages because there were only 4 or 5 months with positive values of precipitation, whereas for the rest of the year the monthly values were equal to zero. This variation does not significantly affect the results. For computational purposes we use the EOF as the dimensions of reanalysis datasets are large since they combine time series with spatial maps. The EOF characterizes the temporal and spatial patterns of the climatic variables in the areas of interest, and have been used extensively in meteorological and climatological studies (Dai et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1999</xref>). The EOF is equivalent to the principal components used in multivariate statistics and is close relative to the bases used in factor analysis. Furthermore, the EOF basis set defined directly from data can be used to represent a climatological field very economically (Kutzbach 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">1967</xref>), both as a basis for a set of predictors (Barnett and Hasselmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1979</xref>) or as a means of physically interpreting the data (Wallace and Gutzler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1981</xref>). That is, if one thinks of the snapshots of geophysical data maps as realizations of random fields generated by a stochastic process, it is possible to construct second moment statistics linking one point and another in the map. The resulting covariance matrix is real and symmetric and therefore possesses a set of orthogonal eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues. The map associated with each eigenvector represents a pattern that is statistically independent of the others and spatially orthogonal to them. The eigenvalue indicates the amount of variance accounted for by the pattern. The eigenvector patterns contain information about the multidimensional probability distribution that constitutes the climate and are, therefore, of theoretical interest (North 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">1984</xref>). Thus, the EOF is designed to derive the dominant variability patterns from sets of fields of any type of synthetic indicators or indexes, and summarize the variability observed in a group of variables (Bultó et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2006</xref>; Thomson and Emery
