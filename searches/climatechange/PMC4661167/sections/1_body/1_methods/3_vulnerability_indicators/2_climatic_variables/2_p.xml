<p class="p">The climatic variables come from the climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) developed by the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). This reanalysis model is the first that includes both oceanic and atmospheric features, and has demonstrated that it adequately reproduces precipitation and surface temperature, and calibrates for the natural and inter-seasonal variability (Saha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>; Tett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1997</xref>). The ECVs are on a monthly basis for a range of 40 years (1971–2011) and are extracted in a rectangular grid (83 W–74 W, 2 N–6 S). The NCEP reanalysis dataset coincides with the climate observation satellite area, which implies that reliable observations are added in the assimilation process (Kanamitsu et al.
