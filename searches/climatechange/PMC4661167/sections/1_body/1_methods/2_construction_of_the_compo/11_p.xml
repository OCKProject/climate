<p class="p">For vulnerability assessments based on indicators, principal components analysis, encompassing all social and environmental variables, is an alternative to construct the composite vulnerability indicator. It has been widely used and is based on sound statistical theory (Gbetibouo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010</xref>; Leichenko and Oâ€™Brien 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2002</xref>). The aim of PCA is to summarize information through the reduction of dimensions in such a way that the first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. PCA are guaranteed to be independent if the data set is jointly normally distributed (Jolliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2005</xref>). Though we do not intend our assessment approach to compete with PCA, we argue that PCA may exclude variables or indicators with relatively lower contributions to the formation of the components so that a comprehensive ordering of the indicators, as the one we intend in this paper, may not be achieved. The normality assumption in PCA should be managed with care for the same reasons we assume the beta distribution. Thus, PCA would not fit the purpose of this paper. Furthermore, we want to preserve the direct interpretation of results that may not exist when using the components derived from PCA. We therefore restrict the use of PCA for the construction of the EOF and the institutional indicators.
