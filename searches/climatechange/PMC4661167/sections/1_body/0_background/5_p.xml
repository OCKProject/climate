<p class="p">Hence, the purpose of this paper is to assess vulnerability to climate change at a local level in Ecuador. We rely on the statistical behavior of climatic and socioeconomic variables where the weighting and aggregation mechanism of the composite vulnerability indicator is similar to Iyengar and Sudarshan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1982</xref>) and Deepa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2013</xref>). Rather than assuming the variables contribute equally to the composite indicator, our assessment approach defines the weights or contributions of each variables with respect to the aggregated variability of all variables across cantons (i.e. the political-administrative division of Ecuador, see the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Thus, through normalization, this approach mitigates the dominance of variables with large variance. Furthermore, it allows aggregation of variables to a measure of the overall variability that represents the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability (Leichenko and Oâ€™Brien 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2002</xref>). We use a large number of economic, social, and environmental variables to construct the composite vulnerability indicator, and a contribution of this paper is the use of empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) and reanalysis datasets to incorporate the long-run and spatial patterns of the climatic variables.
