 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-10" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). With increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, the habitat suitability for threatened plant species in nature reserves will decrease gradually (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Figs. 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">5</xref>). The climate suitability of 132, 140, and 151 nature reserves are projected to decrease under the low, medium and high concentration scenarios, respectively, by both the 2050s and 2080s (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6" class="xref">Table S6</xref>). Furthermore, the number of nature reserves exhibiting decreased habitat suitability for threatened plant species was larger under the medium and high concentration scenarios for the 2050s relative to the 2080s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Figs. 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">5</xref>). We focused on the habitat suitability of threatened plant species in nature reserves under the high concentration scenario. The nature reserves with decreasing habitat suitability of threatened plant species were distributed across Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Wudaoxia nature reserve (Hubei province) exhibited the largest decrease in climate suitability under the low concentration scenario (in the 2050s), the medium concentration scenario (in the 2080s), and the high concentration scenario (in the 2080s;
