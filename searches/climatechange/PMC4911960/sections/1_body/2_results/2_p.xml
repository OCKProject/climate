<p class="p">For each threatened plant species across all nature reserves, there were significantly positive relationships between 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> (the change in climate suitability between current and future conditions) and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> (the overlap between current and future climate suitability) under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For all threatened plant species belonging to each nature reserve with a decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> value, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values also decreased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, we focused on 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> because of these significantly positive relationships between 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> under the low and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">2</xref>). Climate suitability is projected to decrease significantly from low to high concentration scenarios across the different plant type groups across all the nature reserves (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) and across all threatened plant species occurring within each nature reserve independently (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> values were projected to be larger in the 2080s than the 2050s in the medium and high concentration scenarios based plant type groups (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> increases significantly from low to high concentration scenarios (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Habitat suitability for tree species would decrease most severely, and climate change may have the smallest impact on fern species across all the concentration scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The climate suitability of 63, 65, and 65 threatened plant species are projected to decrease in the low, medium, and high concentration scenarios, respectively, by both the 2050s and 2080s (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" class="xref">Table S5</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Thuja koraiensis</italic> is projected to have the largest decrease in climatically suitable habitat under the high concentration scenario by the 2080s (
