<p class="p">For all 82 threatened plant species across 168 nature reserves, model performance assessed using AUC scores was high (all models had AUC values over 0.7;

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) indicating that the variables selected by a jackknife test typically have consistent and high PC and PI values for tree, shrub, herb, and fern species. The largest effect on habitat suitability for trees (PI, 24.27; PC, 41%), herbs (PI, 22.52; PC, 25%), and ferns (PI, 19.32; PC, 38%) was produced by annual mean temperature changes, and precipitation seasonality most strongly impacted the habitat suitability of shrubs (PI, 17.21; PC, 33%; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). For non-climatic variables, we found that soil pH was the important variable influencing habitat suitability for shrubs (PI, 16.65; PC, 50%) and ferns (PI, 16.82; PC, 25%). Specifically, the most important variables determined in this study were annual mean temperature for 
 <italic class="italic">Malania oleifera</italic> (a tree; PI, 95.615), precipitation seasonality for 
 <italic class="italic">Platycrater arguta</italic> (a shrub; PI, 88.711), and soil pH for 
 <italic class="italic">Alsophila gigantea</italic> (a fern; PI, 90.218; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Table S4</xref>). In addition, we found that temperature seasonality strongly affects habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">Magnolia wilsonii</italic> (a shrub; PI, 92.327) and that mean diurnal range has an important impact on habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">Fokienia hodginsii</italic> (a tree; PI, 61.271;
