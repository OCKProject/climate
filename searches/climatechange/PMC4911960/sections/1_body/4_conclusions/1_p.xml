<p class="p">Our method serves as an important reference for the conservation of plant diversity in the face of climate change. This goal will require both increased research and a continually developed capacity to forecast future climate conditions, as well as identification of the responses of threatened plant species to climate change. An integrative assessment of climate suitability using occurrence localities will enhance the conservation status system for threatened plant species. As climatically suitable habitats decrease for threatened plant species, niche gaps may increase in the future. Climate change may threaten habitat suitability for more than 60 threatened plant species within Chinese nature reserves across more than 130 nature reserves. Hence, climate change is likely to threaten habitat suitability for threatened plant species throughout Chinese nature reserves. Future studies should consider more local scales when making assessments of conservation status for threatened plant species. We urgently need innovative evaluation approaches for threatened plant species at all scales.</p>
