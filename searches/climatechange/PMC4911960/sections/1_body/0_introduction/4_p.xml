<p class="p">Here, we examined the effects of climate change on threatened plant species within nature reserves by assessing changes in climate suitability based on occurrence localities of species compiled from previous field work. In this study, we used Maxent modelling to project the distributions of 82 threatened Chinese plant species from four plant types and distributed among 168 nature reserves. To accomplish this, we fulfilled two goals: (1) the assessment of changes in climate suitability ranges for threatened plants in the future and (2) the evaluation of the overlap between current and future climate suitability ranges. Finally, we suggest several effective approaches for the conservation of threatened plants in the context of climate change.</p>
