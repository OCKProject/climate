<p class="p">Climate change threatens habitat suitability for threatened plant species in more than 130 nature reserves (77.4% of all the nature reserves in the analysis) under the low greenhouse gas concentration scenario, 140 reserves under the medium concentration scenario (83.3%), and 165 reserves (98.2%) under the high concentration scenario by both the 2050s and 2080s. This indicates that climate change will likely decrease the capacity of these nature reserves to protect threatened plants. These nature reserves play an important role in ecosystem services (

Hence, we must take effective measures to reduce the negative effect of climate change on threatened plants within nature reserves, particularly Wudaoxia nature reserve as it is projected to suffer most severely in term of decreasing habitat suitability for threatened plant species.
