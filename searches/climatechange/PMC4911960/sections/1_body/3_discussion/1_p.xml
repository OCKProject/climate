<p class="p">We evaluated the climate suitability of threatened plant species in Chinese nature reserves under future climate change scenarios using occurrence locality data. We project that the habitat suitability of more than 60 threatened plants within more than 130 nature reserves would decrease under these projected climate change scenarios. Overall, this indicates that climate change may threaten habitat suitability of threatened plant species within Chinese nature reserves.</p>
