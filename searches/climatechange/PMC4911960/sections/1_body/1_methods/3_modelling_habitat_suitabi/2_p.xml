<p class="p">We tested the effects of environmental variables on the habitat suitability for threatened plant species using permutation importance (PI) and percentage contribution (PC) based on the jackknife method. PI evaluates the change in model AUC scores when each predictor was randomly permuted. A variable is considered important when AUC scores decrease substantially. PCs represent the influence of a particular environmental variable on the final model; the sum of all the variables is 100%. The threshold PC of habitat suitability for each species was 15% (

 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, we used a linear regression to determine the relationship between the average PI values and the proportion of the total plant species affected using the PC results broken down into the categories of trees, shrubs, herbs, and ferns.
