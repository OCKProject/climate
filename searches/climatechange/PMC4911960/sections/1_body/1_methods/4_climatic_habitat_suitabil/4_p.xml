<p class="p">First, we used a linear regression to explore the relationships between 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> based on occurrence localities of each threatened plant species in all the nature reserves and of all the plants belonging to each nature reserve under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (in both the 2050s and 2080s). We projected a substantial change in habitat suitability between current and future concentration scenarios producing a large gap between current and future climatically suitable habitats of threatened plant species. Hence, we first focused on the change in climate suitability (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>) between current conditions and those of the 2050s and 2080s based on occurrence localities of each species across all nature reserves and of all the threatened plants belonging to each nature reserve individually. Second, we computed the average values of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> for trees, shrubs, herbs, and ferns as groups to determine the change range of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> for different types of plants. Finally, we used a non-parametric test to explore differences in 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> among all plants belonging to each nature reserve and for different plant type groups across all the nature reserves between the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios.
