We obtained the geographical coordinates of occurrence localities within national nature reserves from 168 scientific research reports finished after 1990, drawing our nature reserve samples from all provinces of China except Hong Kong, Macao, Shanghai, Tianjing, and Taiwan. The list of on the threatened plant species within these national nature reserves was drawn in
