<p class="p">We obtained the same bioclimatic variables as 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" class="xref">Table S2</xref> for our future projections. To model the future climate suitability for threatened plant species in roughly the 2050s (i.e., 2040--2069) and 2080s (i.e., 2070--2099), we used the average projection maps generated under four global climate models (i.e., bcc_csm1_1, csiro_mk3_6_0, gfdl_cm3, and mohc_hadgem2_es) and three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios as representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of 2.6 (mean, 270 ppm; range, 140--410 by 2100), 4.5 (mean, 780 ppm; range, 595--1,005 by 2100), and 8.5 (mean, 1,685 ppm; range, 1,415--1,910 by 2100), representing the low, medium, and high gas concentration scenarios, respectively (

We used these three RCPs to represent the low, medium and high emission climate scenarios in order to estimate the future climate suitability for threatened plant species (
