<p class="p">The importance of the relative dose of some contaminants on bacterial diversity has been studied previously. For instance, cadmium has been described to have positive effects on bacterial diversity at intermediate concentrations, while negative effects were shown under high concentrations (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This points to a degree of tolerance of bacterial communities to certain levels of contaminants. Moreover, some contaminants may act as nutrient/energy source at suitable concentrations, only becoming toxic when their concentrations surpass toxicity threshold levels (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Magalh√£es et al., 2011</xref>). In line with this, some pollutants added in this study could have been used as a nutrient/energy source, as may be indicated by bacteria responding positively to pollutant addition. In addition to the dose-dependent effects from pollutants (i.e., direct toxic effects), the importance of temporal exposure has also been defined as a relevant element for effects on the diversity of bacterial communities (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ager et al. (2010)</xref> reported negative effects of pentachlorophenol (organic pollutant also used in the present study) on bacterial diversity, and a subsequent recovery of community structure once the concentration of this pollutant had decreased after approximately 2 weeks. In contrast, in the present study we detected no obvious recovery over time, despite the decreased dissolved concentrations of many of the pollutants added; with stronger differences in community structure, diversity, and BP observed toward the end of the experiment. Although this may relate to the length of the experiment, this could be explained by the presence of multiple stressors (i.e., multiple types of organic pollutants), reducing the ability of some bacteria to develop tolerance to the harmful effects from multiple fronts (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vinebrooke et al., 2004</xref>). This aspect is an important consideration as environmental pollutants often occur in complex mixtures, and while the specific pollutant compounds and their concentrations may have easily definable impacts, the cumulative impacts can often be stronger.
