<p class="p">The effects of organic pollutants on bacterial communities were generally less pronounced than the effects observed due to tDOM addition. However, differences at the OTU level between polluted and non-polluted treatments were recorded. Pollutant addition appeared to have little impact on BP and Shannon’s diversity in the CONT–POLL comparison, but mesocosms with tDOM addition were apparently negatively impacted by pollutant addition in the latter stages of the experiment (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). In general, the differences in bacterial diversity creating this latter pattern mainly resulted from higher abundances of some OTUs in SOIL-EX compared to SOIL–POLL, such as OTU_39 (
 <italic class="italic">Alcaligenaceae</italic> family), OTU_271 (
 <italic class="italic">Planctomyces</italic> spp.), or OTU_613 (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoclavibacter</italic> spp.), among others (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). This could indicate some form of direct toxicity due to the pollutant addition and would explain why the strong recovery of BP in the SOIL-EX treatment was inhibited in the SOIL–POLL treatment despite the same additions of tDOM. The lower bacterial diversity observed in the SOIL–POLL treatment, as opposed to the SOIL-EX treatment, was generally due to the overall decrease in abundance of rare bacteria (&gt;1% relative abundance). Similarly, other studies have pointed out the importance of fluctuations of rare bacteria on the diversity of bacterial communities in the presence of organic pollutants (
