<p class="p">On the other hand, we detected some combined effects of tDOM and pollutants. Four major trends (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>) were detected as a result of the co-effects of pollutant and tDOM addition. Thus, pollutant addition had a positive effect on certain bacteria, which was removed by the addition of tDOM, possibly due to the attachment of the organic pollutants to DOC and other particles (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripszam et al., 2015a</xref>), preventing these bacteria from utilizing them. This trend was observed in, for example, two members of the family 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodobacteraceae</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Gemmobacter</italic> ssp., OTU_7 and 
 <italic class="italic">Loktanella</italic> ssp., OTU_169), and an unclassified member of the family 
 <italic class="italic">Methylophilaceae</italic> (OTU_15). Members from both bacterial families have been previously described to utilize some organic pollutants as a food source (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gutierrez et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). Other bacteria showed a negative impact from pollutant addition, which was neutralized when tDOM was added, likely due to the attachment of the toxic pollutants to tDOM and a consequent toxicity abatement. One important example is 
 <italic class="italic">Ilumatobacter</italic> ssp. (OTU_29), which was one of the most abundant bacteria in the present study. The abundance of this OTU dropped by approximately 21% when only pollutants were added, while it did not significantly differ from the control when increased tDOM was also present. Other bacteria showed a positive synergistic effect from the combination of organic pollutants and tDOM additions. Examples of this trend are 
 <italic class="italic">Janthinobacterium</italic> ssp. (OTU_1), 
 <italic class="italic">Paenibacillus</italic> ssp. (OTU_79), 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia</italic> ssp. (OTU_144), and 
 <italic class="italic">Silvimonas</italic> ssp. (OTU_343). These bacteria mainly originated from the soil addition and showed higher abundances when organic pollutants were also present. 
 <italic class="italic">Janthinobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Paenibacillus</italic> genera have been previously described to grow in water samples exposed to various organic pollutants (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hesselsoe et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grady et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a negative combined effect from organic pollutants and tDOM additions was observed in some bacteria, preventing them to fully increase their growth under elevated tDOM conditions. Thus, Bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Glacieola</italic> ssp. (OTU_757), 
 <italic class="italic">Hahella</italic> ssp. (OTU_1141), 
 <italic class="italic">Verrucomicrobia Subdivision3</italic> (OTU_466), and 
 <italic class="italic">Bdellovibrio</italic> ssp. (OTU_703) showed the highest abundances under increased tDOM conditions, but their growth was limited when organic pollutants were also present. Interestingly, this toxic effect was not observed when only pollutants (and not tDOM) were added. Some of these bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Glacieola</italic> ssp., have been previously described to grow under elevated DOM concentrations (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sipler et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">von Scheibner et al., 2017</xref>). The toxicity effects observed on these bacteria could possibly be explained by the adsorption of organic pollutants onto tDOM (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripszam et al., 2015a</xref>), increasing the direct contact and thus the toxicity.
