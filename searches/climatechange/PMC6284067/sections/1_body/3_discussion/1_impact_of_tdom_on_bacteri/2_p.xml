<p class="p">Despite the relative stability of the abundant and many moderately abundant classes, a number of OTUs belonging to these classes were positively affected by tDOM addition. Bacteria belonging to the orders 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizobiales</italic> (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Bradyrhizobium</italic> spp., OTU_495; and OTU_268), 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriales</italic> (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Buttiauxella</italic> spp., OTU_109 and 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia</italic> spp., OTU_144), 
 <italic class="italic">Solirubrobacterales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Conexibacter</italic> ssp., OTU_1008), 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderiales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Janthinobacterium</italic> spp., OTU_1), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Paenibacillus</italic> spp., OTU_79 and OTU_161), and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium sensu stricto</italic> ssp., OTU_71) were boosted by the addition of soil extract (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>), before stabilizing at lower abundances during the later stages of the experiment. These bacterial classes likely represent members of the soil bacterial community that entered the system due to soil extract addition, though determining survival or any particular function within the system would require further specific studies. On the other hand, bacteria belonging to the orders 
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonadaceae</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonas</italic> spp., OTU_206), 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodobacterales</italic> (OTU_41), 
 <italic class="italic">Actinomycetales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoclavibacter</italic> spp., OTU_613), 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomycetales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Planctomyces</italic> spp., OTU_271), or 
 <italic class="italic">Alteromonadales</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Glacieola</italic> spp., OTU_757) showed a positive response to tDOM addition, increasing in relative abundance at later stages of the experiment (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). These differing trends suggest different dynamics in bacterial activity from different members in the same community, with some bacterial taxa displaying higher response capabilities than others under elevated tDOM, which has been observed in similar studies (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Traving et al., 2017</xref>). Most of these bacterial taxa have previously been shown to respond positively to tDOM. For example, the 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic> orders 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodobacterales</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizobiales</italic> have been described to metabolize high and low molecular weight organic matter and various aromatic compounds, and to inhabit both terrestrial and aquatic environments (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kersters et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2012</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">Gammaproteobacteria</italic> genus 
 <italic class="italic">Glacieola</italic> has been described to be a non-abundant member of bacterioplankton communities capable of growing under increased DOM levels (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sipler et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">von Scheibner et al., 2017</xref>). The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonas</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonadetes</italic> class) responded positively to long-term exposure to increased concentration of DOC (i.e., after 5 weeks), which has been also described in a similar study (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Traving et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, although most of the bacteria significantly affected by the addition of tDOM showed a positive response, we also found some bacteria that responded negatively to increased tDOM, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> ssp. (OTU_21), 
 <italic class="italic">Lactococcus</italic> ssp. (OTU_349), 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> ssp. (OTU_476), and an unclassified member of the family 
 <italic class="italic">Oxalobacteraceae</italic> (OTU_141). These bacteria showed the highest abundances in the control mesocosms and remarkably decreased in abundance in the mesocosms with tDOM addition.
