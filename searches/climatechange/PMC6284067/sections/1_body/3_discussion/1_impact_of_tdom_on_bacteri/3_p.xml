 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rowe et al., 2018</xref>), even if production is only temporarily elevated (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Figueroa et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, allochthonous DOM can influence the bacterial community (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Judd et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Logue et al., 2016</xref>), and the processing of the DOM can have consequences for ecosystem function and global biogeochemical cycles (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Benner and Amon, 2015</xref>). In this study, patterns of BP in mesocosms receiving tDOM addition differed from their respective controls, with a secondary peak developing in the latter stages of the experiment. This corresponded with a notable increase of Ptot and DIP after 2 weeks in the mesocosms that also took place only in mesocosms with tDOM addition. The release of inorganic phosphorus as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from anoxic sediments to the water column has been described in both lakes and brackish waters such as the Baltic Sea (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stigebrandt et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In the present experiment, we observed a decrease in phytoplankton abundance during the first 2 weeks (unpublished data) and an enhanced sedimentation in the mesocosms with tDOM addition resulting in sinking particles and aggregates from the water column (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripszam et al., 2015b</xref>). The sedimentation of such particles created a visible bottom layer within the mesocosms, consisting of organic matter from phytoplankton detritus, zooplankton fecal pellets, and particles from the added tDOM itself. It appears likely that the anoxic and micro-oxic environments that would have formed contributed greatly to the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> cycling in the experimental systems. Under anoxic conditions, the phosphorous stored in the sedimented particles can be released to the water column as DIP or SRP due to microbial processes carried out by some bacteria, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria, leading to an internal loading of phosphorus and thus an elevation of both the DIP and the total phosphorus in the water column (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Palmer-Felgate et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sinkko et al., 2011</xref>). The internal phosphorus loading is a phenomenon increasingly studied in the Baltic Sea (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stigebrandt et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, such processes have been identified to take place even within aggregates and particles formed within the water column itself (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ploug et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Riemann and Azam, 2002</xref>). In the present study, microbial communities from sedimented material itself were not analyzed. However, we found some sulfate-reducing bacteria present in low abundance especially in the soil extract utilized, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfosporosinus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfopila</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfofaba</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfobulbus</italic> (data not shown), which have been previously described in the Baltic Sea (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Korneeva et al., 2015</xref>). Within the oxygen depleted microzones generated in the bottom of the mesocosms receiving tDOM addition, the metabolism of these specific bacteria could have been enhanced, enabling them to generate the increased DIP and Ptot concentrations observed. Since 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> is generally the limiting nutrient in the region where study waters were collected (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tamminen and Andersen, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>), this process would clarify why bacterial communities, now flushed with newly released DIP, were able to have a second peak of production in the later stages of the experiment only in those mesocosms receiving tDOM addition.
