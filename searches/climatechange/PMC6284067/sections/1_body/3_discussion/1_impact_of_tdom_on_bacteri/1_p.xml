<p class="p">Allochthonous organic matter inputs have been shown to promote bacterial metabolism and lead to changes in bacterial community structure (

In the present study, increased tDOM concentration (in the form of soil extract) had a measurable effect on diversity and community structure, altering the bacterioplankton community present in the starting mesocosm waters (natural Baltic Sea waters). The addition of soil extract led to higher BP, higher total BA, and higher bacterial α-diversity (Shannon’s diversity). However, the relative abundances of the major bacterial classes identified in this study were not significantly affected by the addition of tDOM, remaining relatively stable between the different treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>). Classes such as 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Betaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Spartobacteria</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteriia</italic> have been widely described to be common and abundant members of bacterial communities in marine waters, particularly in the Baltic Sea (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which is consistent with the high degree of resilience and redundancy of these bacterial groups under environmental disturbance (

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shade et al., 2012</xref>). The greatest differences in community structure at class level between the different treatments were mainly observed in moderately abundant and rare bacterial classes. For example, relative abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cytophagia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Deltaproteobacteria</italic> generally correlated positively with increased tDOM concentrations (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B,C</xref>), and as noted in other studies (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedrós-Alió, 2012</xref>) shifts in the non-abundant bacterial taxa were observed.
