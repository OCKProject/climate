<p class="p">While further studies, for example functional and activity analyses, would be needed to confirm the specific role of certain taxa (e.g., survival, active role in the environment, contribution to net BP), it does appear that general microbial community analysis has the potential to offer some insights into environmental stressors. Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al. (2012)</xref> alluded to the utility of bacterial communities as rapid and sensitive indicators of environmental disturbance induced by the presence of contaminants. In this regard, we identified a number of OTUs significantly responding to the presence of organic pollutants alone and in combination with increased tDOM. Therefore, given the proliferation of specific bacterial taxa within the communities after this type of environmental disturbance, the rapid generation times displayed by bacterial species, their high sensitivity to disturbance induced by tDOM and organic pollutants, and the decreasing cost of metagenomics analyses, bacterial communities may represent rapid and efficient indicators to assess this type of environmental disturbance.
