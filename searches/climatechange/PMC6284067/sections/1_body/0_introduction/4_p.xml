<p class="p">In order to determine the effects of increased tDOM concentration, occurrence of organic pollutants (sub-acute toxicity levels), and the combined effect of these two factors on pelagic bacterial communities, a mesocosm study was carried out over 5 weeks employing natural sea water from a coastal area of the Bothnian Sea. Bacterial communities in the mesocosms were sampled once per week, and characterized using high-depth sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragment. The impact of the mesocosm treatments on bacterial community structure, as well as on individual bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were analyzed with multivariate statistical techniques.</p>
