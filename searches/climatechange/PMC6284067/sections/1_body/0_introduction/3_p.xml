<p class="p">The fate and redistribution of organic pollutants are also of major concern in regard to projected climate change impacts on marine environments (EU Directive 2008/105/EC;

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripszam et al., 2015a</xref>). The Baltic Sea is subjected to inputs of organic pollutants (persistent and emerging) from diverse anthropogenic sources, such as industrial processes or agricultural products (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), which are channeled into marine environments via direct urban and industrial effluents, terrestrial runoff, ocean currents, or atmospheric transport and deposition (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bidleman et al., 2015</xref>). Weather factors linked to climate change, such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation patterns, ice cover, and rising sea levels, are projected to increase the mobilization of organic pollutants from their source to the marine environment (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kallenborn et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, quality and quantity of DOC have been shown to play an important role in the fate of organic pollutants in the Baltic Sea and other brackish water environments due to differential sorption of organic pollutants to DOC. Such factors influence the solubility, transport, bioavailability, and food web transfer of these organic pollutants (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripszam et al., 2015a</xref>). It is thus expected that they will have a major impact on the Baltic Sea marine environment under predicted future climate change scenarios. While some studies have explored the consumption and metabolism of organic pollutants by different bacterial taxa or their potential for bioremediation (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nzila, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kang, 2014</xref>), little is known about effects of organic pollutants on the structure of naturally occurring marine bacterial communities, particularly under predicted future climate change conditions.
