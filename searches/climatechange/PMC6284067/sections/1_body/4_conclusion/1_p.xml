<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first study on natural bacterioplankton communities under elevated tDOM concentration and in the presence of a mixture of organic pollutants. The addition of tDOM increased bacterial activity (i.e., BP and abundance) and also bacterial diversity; while the addition of organic pollutants led to an overall reduction of bacterial activity and diversity, particularly when comparing bacterial communities under elevated tDOM concentrations. We identified 32 OTUs contributing to the significant differences observed in community composition throughout the experiment, as well as 35 OTUs which responded differently to extended exposure to organic pollutants. These bacteria fell into six major trends according to their response to the stressors: (1) positive response to increased tDOM; (2) negative response to increased tDOM; (3) positive response to organic pollutant addition, which was removed by the addition of tDOM; (4) negative response to pollutant addition, which was neutralized when tDOM was added; (5) positive synergistic effect from the combination of organic pollutants and tDOM additions; 6) negative combined effect from organic pollutants and tDOM additions. Other minor trends included those bacteria that showed direct positive and negative responses to pollutant addition (including methanol). These findings indicate that the interaction between organic pollutants and tDOM, as well as their direct effects, can alter bacterial community structure and function. Furthermore, the changes catalyzed could conceivably have an impact on wider ecosystems processes such as deposition of pollutants to the benthos, microbial-mediated cycles of nutrients, carbon, and pollutants, and even the availability and transfer of pollutants in the food web.</p>
