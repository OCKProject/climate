<p class="p">In order to statistically study the changes in community composition between treatments and throughout the experimental period, a GLM was applied in pairwise comparisons at class level. The GLM analyses showed strong and significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values &lt; 0.01) between the community compositions based on sampling occasion (i.e., a temporal effect) and due to the addition of tDOM for all pair-wise comparisons (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S3</xref>, overall effects). However, this overall analysis gave no indication of a pollutant-based treatment effect (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, overall effects). Similarly, a PCoA indicated a tendency for closer clustering of samples from non-tDOM treatments on the one hand, and tDOM treatments on the other (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>), although the temporal progression (i.e., sampling time) was clearly a more dominant factor.
