<p class="p">The GLM highlighted bacterial taxa that significantly contributed to the differences observed between communities over time and between treatments. Within the abundant classes, 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic> did not significantly contribute to temporal or treatment differences. Other bacterial classes among the abundant group, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Betaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomycetia</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">Spartobacteria</italic>, did not show significant differences between treatments. However, they did show significant differences according to sampling occasion in most of the pairwise comparisons (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This is in line with the relative abundances shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>, where 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic> increased in mid-experiment, 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomycetia</italic> generally increased toward the end of the experiment, and 
 <italic class="italic">Spartobacteria</italic> showed higher relative abundances from week 2 onward. 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacteria</italic> classes showed no significant differences by treatments overall, although significant temporal differences were found (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, similar relative abundances of some classes on certain sampling weeks showed pairing between the two tDOM treatments and pairing of the non-tDOM treatments, for example 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteria</italic> at week 2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>).
