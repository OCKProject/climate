<p class="p">The diversity (Shannon’s diversity index) of the communities decreased from the outset of the experiment until week 2 in all treatments, after which a divergence between tDOM and non-tDOM treatments (increasing or plateauing, respectively) was recorded (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Significant differences were found between different treatments across the overall experimental period, with tDOM treatments showing higher diversity than non-tDOM treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S2</xref>). On the other hand, no overall significant differences were found between pollutant and non-pollutant containing treatments. However, analysis of OTU composition from week 5 alone (representative of the outcome of persistent exposure to the pollutant mixture) indicated significant differences between treatments CONT and POLL, and between SOIL-EX and SOIL–POLL (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
