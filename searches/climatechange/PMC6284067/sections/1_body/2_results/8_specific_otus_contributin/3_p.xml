<p class="p">Correlations between OTU abundance and concentration of the different pollutants added to the mesocosms highlighted a number of relevant interactions between some OTUs and pollutants (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13" class="xref">S6</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" class="xref">S6</xref>). Some OTUs, such as OTU_79, OTU_144, or OTU_387, showed strong and significant correlations with several pollutants almost exclusively in the SOILâ€“POLL treatment, though it must be noted that these OTUs also showed strong correlations with DOC. On the other hand, OTUs, such as OTU_206, OTU_268, OTU_571, and OTU_1008, showed significant correlations with different pollutants, almost exclusively under POLL treatment. Certain OTUs (e.g., OTU_81, OTU_115, and OTU_3075) showed significant correlations under both pollutant addition treatments. Finally, some OTUs did not show any significant correlation with the concentrations of any pollutants in the added pollutant cocktail (e.g., OTU_442 and OTU_495). Most of the significant correlations between specific OTUs and pollutant concentrations were positive, though certain OTUs such as OTU_81, OTU_261, and OTU_343 showed negative correlations (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13" class="xref">S6</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" class="xref">S6</xref>). However, it must be noted that OTU_81 showed increased abundance at the latter stages of the experiment in both pollutant addition treatments (Figure
