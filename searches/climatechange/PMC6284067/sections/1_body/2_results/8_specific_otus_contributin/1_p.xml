<p class="p">Individual OTUs contributing to the significant differences observed between communities from different treatments were highlighted using a GLM approach at the OTU level. Among the 544 OTUs recorded, only 32 showed overall significant differences between treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Such OTUs were generally in low abundance, although they mostly belonged to abundant classes such as 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Betaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomycetia</italic>. Six of these OTUs belonged to moderate classes (
 <italic class="italic">Bacilli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonadetes</italic>) and five to rare classes (
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria_Gp1</italic> and _
 <italic class="italic">Gp2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ktedonobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Negativicutes</italic>). Overall, the differences generally lay in higher abundances of these OTUs occurring in tDOM treatments, which is in line with higher Shannon’s index values from these treatments. However, one exception was OTU_81 (
 <italic class="italic">Betaproteobacteria</italic>), that appeared to respond to the presence of pollutants. This OTU remained in low abundance (52–223 reads; rarefied counts) until week 2 in all treatments, after which it increased to as many as 10,015 reads in polluted treatments toward the end of the experiment. It is worth noting that the five OTUs belonging to rare classes were found to be present only in tDOM treatments, which suggests that their presence was specifically attributed to the addition of soil extract (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). In addition, these OTUs were indeed found in samples from the soil extract (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11" class="xref">S4</xref>).
