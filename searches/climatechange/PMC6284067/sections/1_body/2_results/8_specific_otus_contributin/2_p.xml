<p class="p">Pearsonâ€™s correlations between specific OTUs (those identified by the GLM analysis) and an array of physicochemical and biological variables measured during the mesocosm experiment indicated strong and significant correlations between the abundance of certain OTUs and DOC concentration, PP, and Chl-
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>; especially in the tDOM treatment mesocosms (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S5</xref>). While the correlations with PP were mainly positive, the correlations with DOC were generally negative. However, in many cases the strong negative correlations with DOC relied on higher numbers of these OTUs during week 0 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12" class="xref">S5</xref>), after which their abundance stabilized or decreased, while DOC concentration continued rising due to further (smaller) soil additions. Among the bacterial taxa responding positively to elevated tDOM, some OTUs showed significant correlations with both DOC and nutrients (Ptot and Ntot), such as OTU_206, OTU_268, OTU_452, and OTU_495 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S5</xref>). On the contrary, most of these OTUs showed significant correlations with DOC but not with nutrients (e.g., OTU_1, OTU_71, OTU_79, OTU_109, etc.).
