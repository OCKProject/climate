<p class="p">The experiment started at the peak of the spring bloom. PP was thus highest at the beginning of the experiment and decreased as inorganic nutrients were consumed (Supplementary Figures

In the early part of the experiment, fish heavily grazed on zooplankton (by circa week 2), reducing zooplankton biomass circa 10-fold by the end of the experiment. This process released ciliates and other potential bacterial grazers from predation (provisional assessment, data not shown). Heterotrophic bacteria showed an overall increase from the start to the middle of the experiment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>), where after they decreased in abundance.
