<p class="p">The concentration of pollutants in the water strongly declined during the initial days directly after their addition, and remained at low levels throughout the experiment (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9" class="xref">S2</xref>). A rapid redistribution of these compounds took place with pollutants moving from the aqueous phase to DOC, particles, biota, the walls of the containers, and via evaporation. The partitioning of pollutants to DOC, biota, and particles was particularly pronounced under higher DOC conditions (SOIL–POLL treatment). Sedimentation was also higher in SOIL–POLL treatment, leading to higher pollutant losses in this treatment compared to POLL treatment. A detailed description of the pollutants and their behavior can be found in
