<p class="p">At the end of the experiment (i.e., at week 5), a number of OTUs showing significant differences in abundance between polluted and non-polluted treatments (i.e., CONT vs. POLL and SOIL-EX vs. SOIL–POLL) were identified (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). OTUs containing less than 100 reads in total (from all replicates) were discarded, leaving 13 OTUs that showed significant differences between treatments CONT and POLL, and 25 OTUs between treatments SOIL-EX and SOIL–POLL (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Eight of thirteen OTUs showed higher abundance in the POLL treatment, whereas only 6 of 25 did so in the SOIL–POLL treatment. Of these, only OTU_81 showed significant differences in both pair-wise comparisons (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>).
