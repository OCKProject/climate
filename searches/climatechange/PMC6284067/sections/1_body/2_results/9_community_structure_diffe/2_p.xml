<p class="p">In order to find out whether these OTUs were driven by soil extract addition and not only by the presence of pollutants, the same OTUs were studied by analysis of variance between tDOM and non-tDOM treatments at week 5 (i.e., CONT vs. SOIL-EX and POLL vs. SOIL–POLL) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). OTU_7, OTU_15, and OTU_169 showed the highest abundance in treatment POLL compared with the other treatments. OTU_81 showed significantly higher abundance in both polluted treatments compared with the non-polluted treatments. On the other hand, OTU_29 showed lower abundance in treatment POLL compared with the control. OTU_41 and OTU_692 showed significantly higher abundance in treatments with increased DOC concentration (i.e., treatments POLL, SOIL-EX, and SOIL–POLL), while others, such as OTU_21, OTU_349, and OTU_476, showed lower abundance in these treatments compared with the control. Many of the OTUs from this analysis (17 out of 35) presented the highest abundances in treatment SOIL-EX compared with the rest of treatments (e.g., OTU_271, OTU_613, OTU_703, OTU_757, etc.), showing significantly lower abundances in treatment SOIL–POLL compared with treatment SOIL-EX. On the other hand, OTU_1, OTU_79, OTU_144, and OTU_343 showed the highest abundances in treatment SOIL–POLL compared to the rest, including treatment SOIL-EX.
