<p class="p">A total of 11,631,371 high-quality sequences remained after quality control, trimming and denoizing, with an average of 176,233 ± 36,625 sequences per sample, which resulted in a total of 11,321 OTUs recorded after clustering at 97% similarity level. In order to discriminate and visualize the structure of the bacterial communities, the taxa were divided based on their relative contribution to the overall community using the following thresholds set at class level: &gt;1% as abundant taxa, between 0.1% and 1% as moderate taxa, and &lt;0.1% as rare taxa (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar classifications have been used previously (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lindh et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). The most abundant classes were 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Betaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteriia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacteriia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, comprising 67–86% of the overall relative abundance (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>). Although some fluctuation was observed, their relative abundances in general remained relatively stable throughout the experimental time and across treatments. Nonetheless, 
 <italic class="italic">Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingobacteriia</italic> generally showed higher relative abundances during the first weeks, particularly in the tDOM-amended treatments. Moderately abundant taxa were composed of eight major classes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>). Differences between tDOM and non-tDOM treatments were apparent in this category, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacilli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic> at the beginning of the experiment, or 
 <italic class="italic">Deltaproteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gemmatimonadetes</italic> at weeks 3 and 5. Rare taxa encompassed a much larger selection of bacterial classes than the more abundant taxa (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3C</xref>), and differences between tDOM and non-tDOM treatments were observed, especially at week 5. 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes incertae sedis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Phycisphaerae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Subdivision_3</italic> represent notable examples.
