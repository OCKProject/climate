<p class="p">Bacterial production and DOC were negatively correlated in the control (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.70, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001), while these two factors were positively correlated in SOIL-EX treatment (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.66, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003). On the other hand, comparable correlations were considerably weaker and not significant in treatments SOIL–POLL and POLL (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>-values 0.23 and -0.15, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values 0.37 and 0.54, respectively). BP showed significant positive correlations with Ptot in all treatments except for SOIL–POLL (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.31, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.21), though non-tDOM treatments showed stronger correlations (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.73, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, while in non-tDOM treatments this correlation is explained by a simultaneous, progressive decrease of Ptot and BP, in tDOM treatments the correlations seem to lie in overall increasing values of these two variables (Figure
