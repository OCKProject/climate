Addition of pollutants resulted in an additional increase in DOC concentrations followed by a steady decrease over the duration of the experiment, re-converging with the respective non-pollutant treatments by week 5 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). This increase in DOC concentration was likely due to the pollutants themselves and the use of methanol as the solvent for the cocktail of pollutants (as described in
