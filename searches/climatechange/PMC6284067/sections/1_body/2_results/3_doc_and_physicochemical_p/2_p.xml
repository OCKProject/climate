Although Ptot slightly decreased in all treatments until week 2, its concentration subsequently increased toward week 5 in the tDOM treatments. Similarly, DIP markedly declined during the first 2 weeks in all treatments and then increased toward the end of the experiment only in tDOM treatments. This increase was particularly pronounced in SOIL-EX, though somewhat deferred and lesser in the SOIL–POLL, and in non-tDOM treatments DIP generally remained below the detection limit (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10" class="xref">S3D</xref>). On the other hand, DIN concentrations generally showed a decreasing trend over the duration of the experiment (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10" class="xref">S3F</xref>).
