<p class="p">The addition of soil extract also resulted in the attenuation of the light intensity (PAR) entering the water column. Thus, while the control mesocosms showed an average light intensity of ∼250 μmol PAR quanta m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, the tDOM mesocosms showed on average ∼150 μmol PAR quanta m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, which constitutes a decrease in light intensity by ∼60%.
