<p class="p">Samples for DNA extraction consisted of 500 mL of seawater filtered onto 0.22 μm cellulose–acetate filters (Gelman Supor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>). Each replicated mesocosm was sampled once weekly (except for week 4) and the samples were stored in 1 mL Tris–EDTA buffer (VWR, Radnor, PA, United States) at -80°C. DNA was extracted using an E.Z.N.A.
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>Soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, United States) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified using the primers 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) (Eurofins, Germany). PCR conditions were 95°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Dual-indexed DNA barcodes (Eurofins, Germany) were employed for multiplexing the amplicon libraries in a second PCR reaction using the same PCR conditions. Duplicate PCR reactions were performed in 25 μL volumes containing 1–10 ng DNA template, 12.5 μL 2× Phusion Mastermix (ThermoScientific), 1.25 μL of each adapter (at 10 pmol), and nuclease-free water to complete the final total volume. Duplicate PCR products were pooled, cleaned, and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, United States) and DNA was quantified using a Qubit
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific Fisher, United States).
