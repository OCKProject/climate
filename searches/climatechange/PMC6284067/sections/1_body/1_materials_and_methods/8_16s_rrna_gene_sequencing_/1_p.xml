<p class="p">Polymerase chain reaction products from each mesocosm sample were pooled at equimolar concentration and submitted for 2 × 300 paired-end sequencing on an Illumina
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>MiSeq v3 platform at the Biomedicum Functional Genomics Unit (FuGU), Helsinki (Finland). The FASTQ files generated by Illumina MiSeq were processed in Mothur v. 1.40.5 (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schloss et al., 2009</xref>) according to the Mothur MiSeq standard operating procedure (SOP), with the alterations described in 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Timonen et al. (2016)</xref>. The trimming step was implemented by executing an additional screen.seqs command to remove those contigs presenting a length of the overlapping region from forward and reverse reads below 25 bp. A further screen.seqs command removed ambiguous sequences and homopolymers. The trimmed and denoized sequences were aligned against SILVA reference database (release 119) (

 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yilmaz et al., 2013</xref>) and taxonomically classified with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 80%. As implemented by Mothur 1.40.5, chimeric sequences were checked and removed using the VSEARCH algorithm (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rognes et al., 2016</xref>). The resulting 16S rRNA gene sequences were clustered into OTUs with at least 97% similarity. Sequences have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number
