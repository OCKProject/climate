<p class="p">Alpha diversity from normalized 16S rRNA gene sequences was calculated based on Shannon’s diversity index using the function 
 <italic class="italic">estimate_richness</italic> in the 
 <italic class="italic">phyloseq</italic> package (v. 1.19.1). Significant differences in the Shannon’s index were tested using two-way repeated measurement ANOVA and Tukey’s honest significant differences tests with pairwise comparisons.
