<p class="p">Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured using a PAR Licor sensor (LICOR â€“193SA). The measurements were performed weekly in each mesocosms at five special positions at the surface (45 and 90 cm depths). The resulting 15 data points were used to calculate the average PAR values for each mesocosm.</p>
