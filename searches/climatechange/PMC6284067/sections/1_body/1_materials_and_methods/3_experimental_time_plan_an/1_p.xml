<p class="p">On the 29 May, the mesocosms were filled with 946 L of seawater (salinity ∼3) collected from the research stations central supply of seawater, whose intake is placed 1 km offshore of the UMF facility (63°33′27.0″N 19°50′7.5″E). A soil extract, representative of a quarter of the total planned additions (0.5 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> of the 2 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> addition described above), was then added to the respective treatment tanks (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>) after approximately 1 day of food web stabilization had been allowed. The final 75% increase in DOC concentration was achieved by sequential smaller additions (0.14 mg C L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 6.8% of total planned additions) of soil extract (tDOM) added every third day over the duration of the experiment. Following the first tDOM addition, the mesocosms were left to equilibrate for approximately 4 days, after which a cocktail of pollutants was added at sub-acute toxicity levels (0.1 μg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) to the respective treatment tanks (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stepanauskas et al. (2002)</xref>, ∼30% of the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and ∼75% of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) are potentially bioavailable for bacterioplankton in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, those mesocosms without soil addition received the corresponding DIN and DIP supplements (weekly) in order to match the concentrations in the mesocosms with soil addition and to balance for bioavailability. Twenty liters of water (inclusive of sampling waters) was removed from each tank three times a week throughout the experiment and replaced with fresh seawater that had been passed through a 1-μm filter. Finer filtration or the re-fill water was hampered due to technical constrains during the experiment. The mesocosms were sampled weekly and a number of physicochemical and biological parameters were measured on each occasion and in every mesocosm tank, as described below.
