<p class="p">Bacterial net production (BP) was measured using the [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuhrman and Azam, 1982</xref>). Four 1 mL replicates and one killed control were incubated in the dark at 15°C for 1 h with [
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>H-methyl]-thymidine (84 Ci mmol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, Perkin Elmer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Wellesley, MA, United States) at a final concentration of 24 nM. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 100 μL of ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the samples were then centrifuged in the cold at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellet was washed with 5% TCA and, and after adding 1 mL of scintillation cocktail the samples were analyzed in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS 6500/Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR). BP was calculated using a conversion factor of 1.4 × 1018 cells mol
