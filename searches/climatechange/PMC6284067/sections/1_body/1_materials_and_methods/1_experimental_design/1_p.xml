<p class="p">The mesocosm experiment was performed in May–July 2013 over a 6-week period at the Umeå Marine Sciences Center (UMF), Sweden. Twenty-four polypropylene tanks (1 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) were filled with 300-μm filtered water from the northern coastal Baltic Sea (63°33′27.0″N 19°50′7.5″E) (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8" class="xref">S1</xref>), and thus included a natural seawater community of bacteria, phytoplankton, protozoa, and mesozooplankton. Furthermore, 10 larval perch individuals were added to each mesocosm as top consumer. Two variables were altered in a 2 × 2 factorial design: DOC concentration and pollutant addition; and identical mesocosm treatments were exposed to two temperatures (15 and 18°C), as described in detail by

The 3°C change was considered to likely influence functional and metabolic aspects more strongly than community aspects over the relatively short experimental duration. Thus, only samples from the 15°C treatment were analyzed in this present study. Overall, the treatments in this study were (1) control (CONT) – ambient water conditions (i.e., natural DOC concentrations and no pollutants added), (2) soil extract addition (SOIL-EX) – elevated DOC concentrations by addition of extracted terrestrial matter, (3) pollutant addition (POLL) – addition of a pollutant mixture, and (4) pollutant and soil extract addition (SOIL–POLL) – addition of extracted terrestrial matter and the addition of pollutants. All treatments were applied in triplicate, making a total of 12 mesocosms.
