Next, a sub-sample of 5 mL from each tube was mixed with 150 μL 6 M HCl. After 30 min of bubbling, 15 mL scintillation cocktail was added and thoroughly mixed. The samples were analyzed in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS 6500/Packard Tri-Carb 1600 TR) and net PP was calculated as describe in
