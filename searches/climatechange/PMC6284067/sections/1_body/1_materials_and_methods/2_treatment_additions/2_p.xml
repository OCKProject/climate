<p class="p">POLL treatment â€“ pollutants were selected from a list of hazardous substances presented by the 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Commission, 2008</xref> (EU Directive 2008/105/EC). This list includes different groups of organic pollutants with clearly differentiated structural elements (e.g., anilines and phenols with different degrees of bromination), as well as polar and non-polar properties. The selected chemicals represent compounds commonly isolated in the Baltic Sea, including: (1) persistent pollutants [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); polychlorinated benzenes (PCBz); polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)], which have been described to be very bioaccumulative and have hazardous effects on living organisms (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WHO, 2000a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>); and (2) emerging pollutants, such as anthropogenic organophosphates (used as plasticizers and flame retardants) and biogenic low molecular weight brominated compounds, which have been shown to have carcinogenic and neurotoxic effects (

 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van der Veen and de Boer, 2012</xref>, EU Directive 2012/125/EC). The selected pollutants fell into nine categories according to their chemical composition (Supplementary Figure
