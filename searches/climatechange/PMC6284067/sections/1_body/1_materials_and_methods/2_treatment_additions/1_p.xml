<p class="p">SOIL treatment – DOC increase was driven by the addition of a tDOM extract formed from soil material collected locally on the banks of the Öre river (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lefébure et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, this process involved collected soil being mixed with Milli-Q water and ion exchange resin (Amberlite IRC 7481) for 48 h at 4°C, prior to filtering through a 90-μm mesh. Carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen concentrations were measured to enable calculation of volumes to be added. The addition of soil extract was done to increase the ambient DOC concentration (ca. 4 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) to 6 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, a 50% increase from current DOC levels, as predicted in coastal climate change scenarios for the region (
