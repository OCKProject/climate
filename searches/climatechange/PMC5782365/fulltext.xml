These changes are likely to increase species extinction rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Organisms that depend strongly on short windows of rainfall and suitable temperatures to complete their life cycles may be especially vulnerable to climate change. They will be exposed to shortened growing seasons, which impose more stringent time constraints on maturation and reproduction, reduce population growth rates and increase extinction risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Many organisms from temporary habitats, such as desert annuals or temporary pool zooplankton, have dormant life stages (seeds or eggs), known as propagules, that can withstand harsh conditions including desiccation and survive extended dry periods as part of a propagule bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The propagule bank spreads recruitment over multiple potential growing seasons through long term dormancy and delayed development, thereby buffering populations against unfavorable growing seasons and demographic catastrophes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both empirical and modelling studies demonstrate that propagule banks are crucial for the resilience of populations, especially when growing seasons are often unsuitable for successful reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The propagule bank can only promote population resilience when two crucial assumptions are met. First, a given fraction of propagules must survive desiccation until the next suitable growing season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, propagules must be able to remain dormant for long periods without dying and their dormancy should be lifted by cues of favorable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Second, all propagules should not hatch or germinate simultaneously during any given reproductive window as this could lead to a demographic catastrophe if the window is too short for successful reproduction. The fractions of propagules that resume development or remain dormant are probably important determinants of long term population fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but empirical evidence supporting this is sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Combined, propagule survival and development rates buffer populations against environmental stochasticity.</p><p id="Par7">Although it has been suggested that propagule banks will be vital for organisms such as freshwater zooplankton to maintain positive long term population growth in the face of climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], little research exists on the possible effects of climate change on propagule banks. For instance, it is mostly unknown whether propagule survival would be affected by realistic changes in current temperatures under climate change. If this is the case, climate change could threaten the very mechanisms needed for demographic resilience. However, thus far, there are no studies that have investigated the long term effects of changes to current temperature cycles on the survival of dormant propagules of plants or animals, let alone the consequences for population growth rates. In this context, demographic models that can incorporate experimentally determined responses of life history traits and link this to fitness, may have an important role to play and can contribute to more realistic estimates of the responses of populations to climate change.</p><p id="Par8">Here, we used an animal with dormant propagules as a model system and performed a long term experiment to measure the impact of increased temperature on the survival and hatching of propagules. We then fed these measured life-history parameters into a recently developed matrix population model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and examined how they affect the long term persistence of populations. As model organism, we used fairy shrimps (Crustacea, Branchiopoda, Anostraca), which are common inhabitants of temporary aquatic habitats on all continents. They are dominant filter feeders and strong competitors and their biomass is important as a food source for higher trophic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our model species is <italic>Branchipodopsis wolfi</italic> Daday 1910, a fairy shrimp from small temporary pool habitats in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These specific habitats already experience extreme climate conditions and propagules in sun-exposed sediment regularly confront temperatures exceeding 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Climate scenarios project a further increase in mean air temperature of approximately 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by 2070 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Since this species may already be approaching the physiological limits of drought tolerance, it is likely to be more vulnerable to the effects of increased temperatures under climate change than species that experience less extreme conditions.</p><p id="Par9">During an 8-month laboratory experiment, we exposed <italic>B. wolfi</italic> propagules to three different temperature treatments: a present-day temperature cycle, a future temperature cycle as expected under climate change and a constant 18&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C treatment. By performing this trial both with recently produced (2&#x000a0;months old) and older propagules (12&#x000a0;months old), we investigated whether age influences temperature sensitivity. To follow-up on changes in survival rates and hatching fractions of eggs that were exposed to different treatments, we quantified these parameters every 8&#x000a0;weeks in a common garden laboratory hatching experiment.</p><p id="Par10">We hypothesize that anticipated increases in temperature will reduce propagule survival and that older eggs will be more sensitive to increased temperatures than younger eggs due to energy depletion. Furthermore, we propose that hatching fractions will increase with higher temperatures because increased energy consumption and subsequent energy depletion may release propagules from dormancy prematurely. Finally, we expect that combining the measured temperature responses with other life history parameters in a matrix population model will demonstrate that long term population growth rates will decline if temperatures increase, thereby exacerbating the risk of extinction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study species</title><p id="Par11">The fairy shrimp <italic>B. wolfi</italic> is one of the dominant crustacean species in temporary aquatic ecosystems in Southern Africa, from large pans to small rock pools.

</p><p id="Par25">Our simulations show that under current temperature conditions extinction risk increases from 0.04 to 4.7% as the median inundation length decreases from 9 to 8&#x000a0;days. In contrast, a similar decline in median inundation length under climate change temperatures will inflate the extinction risk from 12.3 to 100% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> for a worst-case scenario).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">Before the end of this century, climate scenarios project that ambient temperatures will have increased up to 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C across semi-arid regions; including large parts of South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These changes are expected to alter the hydrological regimes of temporary aquatic ecosystems considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which compromises their suitability as habitats for aquatic species. In this study, we demonstrated how rising temperatures will not only threaten the persistence of aquatic species by reducing habitat suitability, but by also compromising a common life-history strategy that supports demographic resilience. Once fed into a matrix population model, our findings showed that higher temperatures reduce the survival rates of dormant propagules in a way that jeopardizes the long term persistence of these populations and may lead to the extinction of vulnerable populations.</p><p id="Par27">The susceptibility of zooplankton populations to drying in temporary aquatic ecosystems is well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Rather than decreasing gradually with decreasing inundation length, our simulations suggest that the probability of <italic>B. wolfi</italic> population persistence depends on a specific threshold, which represents a tipping-point for long term survival. When egg survival rates are based on those under present-day temperature conditions, the critical median inundation length needed for positive population growth is approximately 8&#x000a0;days. However, when egg survival decreases due to higher temperatures, this threshold increases to approximately 9&#x000a0;days. While this change might seem trivially small, it could have considerable consequences for long term persistence. In our study area, for example, this change would mean a 35% decline in the number of pools that can maintain fairy shrimp populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; assuming that inundation lengths would remain unchanged from the present. In reality, however, it is unlikely that climate change will reduce egg survival without also altering inundation patterns, although it is unclear how exactly these will change. Some precipitation forecasts&#x02014;but not all of them&#x02014;suggest that early summer rains might increase as late summer rains decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. So, even if annual precipitation stays constant, it is likely that higher evaporation rates during late summer will accelerate the drying of pools and shorten the median length of inundations.</p><p id="Par28">The long term growth rates of <italic>B. wolfi</italic> populations are highly dependent on long, but infrequent, inundation events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which can last for several months on Korannaberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As an explosive breeder the species benefits from such rare events by increasing the number of eggs in the propagule bank by several orders of magnitude. Considering that inundation lengths of any one pool are approximately log-normally distributed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], such periods of rapid population expansion can help to compensate for the more frequent short inundations with low reproductive success. However, this compensatory mechanism is reliant on long term survival and staggered hatching of dormant eggs over multiple inundations.</p><p id="Par29">In our experiment, <italic>B. wolfi</italic> egg hatching fractions were 12&#x02013;22%. Partial hatching, with fixed hatching fractions proportionate to the probability of reproductive success, presumably evolved as part of a bet hedging strategy that buffers against unpredictable demographic catastrophes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our experiment showed that hatching fractions were unaffected by the long term exposure to increased temperatures. Delayed hatching is most successful as a bet hedging strategy when hatching fractions under suitable hatching conditions are consistent over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our results suggest that this is the case for <italic>B. wolfi</italic>. Although other studies have shown that the hatching success of dormant propagules can be affected by the storage temperature of eggs (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for an overview), these did generally not distinguish whether such changes were due to an actual decrease in hatching fraction of viable eggs or reduced egg survival (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). We do, however, caution against generalizing the finding that hatching fraction is indifferent to higher temperatures. For instance, in their study of annual plants, Ooi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found that higher temperatures affected the germination fractions of some species while the seeds of other species remained unaffected. Thus, a fruitful avenue for future research would be to examine how climate change affects the bet-hedging strategies of various species and how this might influence community interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Our results showed that older <italic>B. wolfi</italic> eggs hatched more often than younger eggs. This might represent a &#x02018;last-chance&#x02019; strategy to avoid mortality when energy reserves are almost depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A mechanistic explanation for this pattern could also be that egg shell pigmentation degrades with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This means that <italic>B. wolfi</italic> embryos may become more receptive to light as an essential hatching cue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as they age. Alternatively, <italic>B. wolfi</italic> embryos might require variable amounts of time to complete development, which would mean that some of the younger eggs were not ready to hatch.</p><p id="Par31">It should be noted that our study measured egg survival rates under laboratory conditions. In nature, survival rates should be considerably lower due to eggs being consumed by generalist predators, such as flatworms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and oribatid mites (unpublished data), blown away by strong winds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or washed away when ponds overflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, our calculations most likely overestimate future egg survival rates. Still, this does not necessarily mean that the studied populations would perish under climate change. For instance, predator and competitor populations may be affected by climate change as well, which would change biotic interactions. Next to that, vulnerability is also determined by the capacity of organisms to acclimate or adapt to novel environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Finally, spatial rescue-effects could reduce risks of, at least permanent, population extinction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although a sequence of short inundations in one pool could lead to a local extinction, it could be followed by recolonization from neighboring populations if these source populations are able to persist under climate change. Yet, in pools with median inundation lengths shorter than 9&#x000a0;days, the number of dispersing eggs required to maintain long term positive population growth under future conditions would be unrealistically high relative to field estimates of passive dispersal rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] as is discussed further in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. Selection, followed by local adaptation, could also moderate the fitness effects of climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and a number of studies have picked up signatures of rapid selection for specific genotypes in response to increased temperatures in freshwater invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, it seems as if <italic>B. wolfi</italic> populations are approaching their limits for adaptation because even under present-day conditions they cannot maintain permanently viable populations in the most ephemeral pools within the Korannaberg cluster. Future work should include experimental evolution trials during which zooplankton populations are exposed to realistic changes in temperature and inundation regime so that potential adaptation can be tracked across generations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">Our study explored how life-history traits interact with environmental conditions to influence the demographics of temporary pool zooplankton species. While we integrate life-history responses and environmental changes, as expected under climate change, we need to combine this further with mechanistic aspects of evolution and species interactions to fully understand the consequences of climate change on aquatic biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, our study is an important first step to understanding whether climate change can erode a species&#x02019; ability to withstand unfavorable habitat conditions. Our findings demonstrate clearly that climate change might not only jeopardize the persistence of aquatic species by reducing habitat suitability, but by also undermining the dormancy mechanism needed for demographic resilience.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
