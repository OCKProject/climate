<p id="Par6" class="p">The propagule bank can only promote population resilience when two crucial assumptions are met. First, a given fraction of propagules must survive desiccation until the next suitable growing season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Thus, propagules must be able to remain dormant for long periods without dying and their dormancy should be lifted by cues of favorable conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Second, all propagules should not hatch or germinate simultaneously during any given reproductive window as this could lead to a demographic catastrophe if the window is too short for successful reproduction. The fractions of propagules that resume development or remain dormant are probably important determinants of long term population fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>], but empirical evidence supporting this is sparse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Combined, propagule survival and development rates buffer populations against environmental stochasticity.
