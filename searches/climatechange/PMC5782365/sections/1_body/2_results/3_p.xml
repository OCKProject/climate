<p id="Par24" class="p">After incorporating average egg survival, as measured in the current temperature treatment, in the matrix population model, simulations indicated that

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for a worst-case scenario). However, in line with our third hypothesis, when egg survival was set to the values measured in the expected future temperature treatment, the minimum required median inundation length increased to 9 days (Fig.
