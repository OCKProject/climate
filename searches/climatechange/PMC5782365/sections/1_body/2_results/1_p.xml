<p id="Par22" class="p">According to the GLMM, egg survival rates differed between the temperature regime treatments (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 43.186, P &lt; 0.001), survival rates of young eggs were significantly higher than those of old eggs (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 28.570, P &lt; 0.001) and survival decreased significantly with increasing incubation time (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 11.795, P &lt; 0.001) (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). As expected from our first hypothesis, Tukey post hoc tests showed that the future climate treatment reduced egg survival significantly more than the present-day (P = 0.015) and constant 18 °C treatments (P = 0.008). Combined, these findings support the assumption that prolonged exposure to hot conditions will increase egg mortality.
