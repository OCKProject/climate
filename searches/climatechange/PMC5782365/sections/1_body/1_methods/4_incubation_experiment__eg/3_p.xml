<p id="Par19" class="p">We investigated the effects of the different temperature regimes on survival rates and hatching fractions of both old and young eggs after 8, 16, 24 and 36 weeks. Hatching fractions were established during common garden experiments under optimal hatching conditions (cf. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]). During each hatching experiment, seven 24-well plates (i.e. 168 eggs) were taken from each of the six conditions and each well was inundated with 2 mL of EPA medium with a conductivity of 50 μS cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The plates were randomly positioned within an incubator at 18 °C and under continuous light (white light, full spectrum, 4000 lx). Hatching was evaluated under a light microscope with a 40× magnification at 12 h intervals until no further hatching was observed for 36 h. At the end of each hatching experiment, the viability of every individual egg was checked according to the protocol of Pinceel and colleagues [
