<p id="Par18" class="p">Plates were randomly positioned in temperature controlled incubators, which were programmed to maintain the desired temperature regimes, under a 12Â h light:dark cycle and a constant relative humidity of 70%. To minimize any confounding effects of the different incubators, temperature regimes were re-divided across incubators and plates were randomly repositioned within incubators three times during the experiment. Furthermore, plates were randomly repositioned within each incubator on a weekly basis to exclude position effects.</p>
