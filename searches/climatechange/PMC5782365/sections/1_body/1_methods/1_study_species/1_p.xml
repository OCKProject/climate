 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> is one of the dominant crustacean species in temporary aquatic ecosystems in Southern Africa, from large pans to small rock pools. In this study, we used populations from rock pools on the summit of Korannaberg mountain (Free State Province, South Africa), S 28° 51′13″, E 27° 13′51″ (Additional file
