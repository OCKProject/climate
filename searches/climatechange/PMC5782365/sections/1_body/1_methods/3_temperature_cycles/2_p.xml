 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Based on this prediction and the ambient-sediment conversion factor, we reconstructed daily temperature cycles that are anticipated under climate change in 2070 (Additional file

In addition to current and cycles of expected future temperatures, we included a third treatment at a constant 18 °C, which is the temperature that results in optimal egg survival and subsequent hatching under laboratory conditions (unpublished data).
