<p id="Par20" class="p">All analyses were performed in R v. 3.3.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2014) and the ‘lme4’ (version 1.1.10) and ‘multcomp’ (version 1.4.6) packages. We tested for effects of temperature regime on egg survival and hatching fraction using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a binomial error distribution and corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">logit</italic> link function since both egg survival (dead or alive) and hatching (no hatch or hatch) were measured as the binary response of individual eggs. In a first GLMM, ‘plate identity’ was included as a random factor, ‘temperature regime’ (present-day cycle, future cycle, constant 18 °C), ‘incubation period’ (8, 16, 24 or 36 weeks) and ‘egg age’ (old or new) as fixed categorical predictors and the binary variable ‘egg survival’ (dead or alive) as response variable. To test for effects of the temperature treatments on hatching, we used a second analogous GLMM with ‘egg hatching’ as a binary response variable. The models were built using the glmer function in the lme4 package for linear mixed effects models. We used likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to test the significance of the main effects. We did this by comparing models with one main effect (the one of interest) excluded to a model with all main effects and the random effect via the ‘drop1’ function. In addition, we performed Tukey post hoc tests using the ‘glht’ function in the ‘multcomp’ package to investigate pairwise differences in survival among resting eggs from the three different temperature regime treatments. Since different plates of eggs were removed from the incubators at each time step to test viability and hatching, there was no need for a repeated measures design with incubation period as a random factor.
