<p id="Par21" class="p">We estimated the impact of measured changes in survival of 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> eggs on population demographics using a stochastic matrix population model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. This model was developed using realistic life-history parameters to simulate population growth rates and extinction risks across 1000 inundations from eight hydrological regimes (median inundation lengths from 5 to 12Â days) that closely match those found in nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The model comprises two life stages, one corresponding to two age classes to account for age-specific trait values: (1) eggs produced during the previous inundation, N
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, (2) older eggs in the egg bank, N
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, and (3) individuals from the active population in the water column, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Detailed information on the modelling procedure is included in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> and in Pinceel et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. The selection of egg survival parameter values is motivated further in Additional file
