<p id="Par14" class="p">Dormant eggs were harvested using a glass pipette and transferred to petri-dishes in temperature-controlled incubators at 18 °C and under a 12 h light:dark regime for dehydration. 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> eggs of two age classes were used as starting material for the long term experiment; ‘old eggs’, which had been stored for about 12 months and ‘young eggs’, which were 2 months old. Both batches of old and young eggs were composed of a random mixture selected in equal proportions from all nine laboratory populations.
