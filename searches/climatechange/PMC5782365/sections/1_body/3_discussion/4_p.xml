<p id="Par29" class="p">In our experiment, 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> egg hatching fractions were 12â€“22%. Partial hatching, with fixed hatching fractions proportionate to the probability of reproductive success, presumably evolved as part of a bet hedging strategy that buffers against unpredictable demographic catastrophes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our experiment showed that hatching fractions were unaffected by the long term exposure to increased temperatures. Delayed hatching is most successful as a bet hedging strategy when hatching fractions under suitable hatching conditions are consistent over time [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Our results suggest that this is the case for 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic>. Although other studies have shown that the hatching success of dormant propagules can be affected by the storage temperature of eggs (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] for an overview), these did generally not distinguish whether such changes were due to an actual decrease in hatching fraction of viable eggs or reduced egg survival (see also [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]). We do, however, caution against generalizing the finding that hatching fraction is indifferent to higher temperatures. For instance, in their study of annual plants, Ooi and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] found that higher temperatures affected the germination fractions of some species while the seeds of other species remained unaffected. Thus, a fruitful avenue for future research would be to examine how climate change affects the bet-hedging strategies of various species and how this might influence community interactions [
