<p id="Par28" class="p">The long term growth rates of 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> populations are highly dependent on long, but infrequent, inundation events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>], which can last for several months on Korannaberg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. As an explosive breeder the species benefits from such rare events by increasing the number of eggs in the propagule bank by several orders of magnitude. Considering that inundation lengths of any one pool are approximately log-normally distributed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>], such periods of rapid population expansion can help to compensate for the more frequent short inundations with low reproductive success. However, this compensatory mechanism is reliant on long term survival and staggered hatching of dormant eggs over multiple inundations.
