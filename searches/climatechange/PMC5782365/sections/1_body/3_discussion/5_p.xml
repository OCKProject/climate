<p id="Par30" class="p">Our results showed that older 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> eggs hatched more often than younger eggs. This might represent a ‘last-chance’ strategy to avoid mortality when energy reserves are almost depleted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. A mechanistic explanation for this pattern could also be that egg shell pigmentation degrades with time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. This means that 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> embryos may become more receptive to light as an essential hatching cue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>] as they age. Alternatively, 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> embryos might require variable amounts of time to complete development, which would mean that some of the younger eggs were not ready to hatch.
