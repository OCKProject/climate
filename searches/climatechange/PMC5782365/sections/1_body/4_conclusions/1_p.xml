<p id="Par32" class="p">Our study explored how life-history traits interact with environmental conditions to influence the demographics of temporary pool zooplankton species. While we integrate life-history responses and environmental changes, as expected under climate change, we need to combine this further with mechanistic aspects of evolution and species interactions to fully understand the consequences of climate change on aquatic biodiversity [

Nevertheless, our study is an important first step to understanding whether climate change can erode a speciesâ€™ ability to withstand unfavorable habitat conditions. Our findings demonstrate clearly that climate change might not only jeopardize the persistence of aquatic species by reducing habitat suitability, but by also undermining the dormancy mechanism needed for demographic resilience.
