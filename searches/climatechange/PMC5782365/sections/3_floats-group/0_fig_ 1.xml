  <p class="p">Surviving and hatching fractions of 
   <italic class="italic">Branchipodopsis wolfi</italic> eggs were determined every 8 weeks during an 8 month laboratory experiment under three different temperature treatments; a present-day cycle (Present), an expected future cycle (Future) and constant 18 °C (18 °C). Both cycles represent daily temperature fluctuations that were calculated based on the average temperature for each hour of the day, with separate values calculated for each month of the year. The experiment included both young and old eggs that were aged 2 and 12 months at the start of the experiment, respectively. Survival of 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> young and 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> old 
   <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> eggs decreased significantly with increased temperatures and incubation time. Hatching fractions of 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> young eggs were not significantly impacted by temperature or incubation time while 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> hatching of old eggs increased significantly in the future climate treatment. Error bars represent standard errors
