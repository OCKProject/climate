<p class="p">Measurement of electrolyte leakage was considered a typical method to estimate membrane integrity in response to environmental stresses and appeared to be a relevant criterion [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> showed that membrane integrity was affected by water stress. The rise of electrolyte leakage observed in this condition was attributed to disruption of cell membranes, probably resulting from protein degradation [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the present study showed significant variation among genotypes. Karim and Nasr99, the oldest cultivars, which exhibit the lowest values of electrolyte leakage, were the two most resistant cultivars, while Salim, the most recent, was one of the most susceptible cultivars.
