<p class="p">Regardless of the water regime, the Om Rabiaa (old) and Maali (recent) cultivars had the highest specific peroxidase activity. Regarding the increase in specific peroxidase activity in a limited water regime (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), Karim cultivar was the most resistant to water deficit conditions (54.07%), while the most affected cultivar was Maali, with a small increase in specific peroxidase activity (14.27%). This parameter allowed a classification similar to those obtained by proline content. The old cultivars appeared to be more reactive, with a high rate of peroxidase activity at water stress conditions, while recent cultivars were characterized by a prevention strategy.
