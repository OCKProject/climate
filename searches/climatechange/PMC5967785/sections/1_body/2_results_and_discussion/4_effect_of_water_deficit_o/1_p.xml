<p class="p">Because it is a fast, powerful, simple and non-destructive technique to measure plant response to abiotic stress, chlorophyll fluorescence is often used in applied research and practice [

 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The Fv/Fm ratio represents the photochemical capacity of photosystem II (PSII) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Therefore, a high value of this ratio indicates that the photosystem is in good condition, whereas lower values of this ratio signify a PSII-center injury under drought conditions. In response to water stress, our study showed a reduced value of Fv/Fm, under 0.830 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196873.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The substantial Fv/Fm decrease was a result of the decreased ability of PSII to reduce the primary acceptor QA (Quinone A) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Our finding was in agreement with previous results that showed that Fv/Fm of drought-stressed plants was lower than that of plants growing in optimal environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Compared to the control treatment, Fv/Fm was significantly lower for Karim, Nasr99, Maali and Salim by 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Om Rabiaa, on the other hand, exhibited an Fv/Fm ratio increase of 1.5%, making it the most resistant cultivar, followed by Karim and Nasr99.
