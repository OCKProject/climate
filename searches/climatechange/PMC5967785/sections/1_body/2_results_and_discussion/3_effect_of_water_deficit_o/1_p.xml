<p class="p">Relative water content (RWC) measurement was a general method used to determine leaf-water balance in plants during water-deficit periods [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Water loss in the stressed leaves of durum wheat was expressed as the leaf water loss rate calculated as a percentage of RWC (%) decrease by time (min) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196873.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The general trend of curves throughout showed that Karim had low water loss compared to Salim, which showed an important decease in RWC. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196873.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> also shows a decrease in the RWC in leaves from 100% at the initiation of experience to 20%, 16%, 13%, 10% and 8% at 90 min for Karim, Nasr99, Om Rabiaa, Maali and Salim, respectively. The highest final RWC was revealed in Karim, and the lowest value was observed in the Salim cultivar. This parameter allowed a classification similar to those obtained by electrolyte leakage: Karim was one of the most resistant, while Salim was the most sensitive to drought.
