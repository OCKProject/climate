 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) showed an increase in all stressed plants. Rainfall conditions induced an increase in proline content similar to changes observed in electrolyte leakage, but with higher (6-fold) amplitude. Similar results were reported by [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], which reported that proline content was positively correlated with membrane integrity, suggesting its use as a selection criterion for drought tolerance. This seems to indicate that proline may play a protective role in minimizing the damage caused by dehydration [
