<p class="p">Proline content was found to respond differently to drought depending on the studied cultivar (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The proline content was approximately 2-fold in recent cultivars but was much more pronounced in the old cultivars, peaking at approximately 6-fold for Karim, the most significant increase; this allowed Karim a good ability to overcome the impact of water stress. In contrast, Salim had the lowest proline increase (x2), making it the most sensitive cultivar. These results were in agreement with [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], which reported that drought stress induced proline biosynthesis and significantly increased proline content in leaves by 86.9% to 700% in comparison with control plants.
