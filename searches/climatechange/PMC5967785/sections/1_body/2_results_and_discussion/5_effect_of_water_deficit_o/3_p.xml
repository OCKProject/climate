<p class="p">Our findings established two groups of cultivars with respect to proline accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), each with a different resistance mechanism for water deficit. The old cultivars (Om Rabiaa, Nasr99 and Karim) appeared to be more reactive, with a high rate of proline accumulation at water stress conditions (3.5-, 5- and 6-fold more elevated), while recent cultivars (Maali and Salim) were characterized by a particular strategy of prevention, with a higher proline content even at well-watered conditions. These results were in accordance with previous indications that the older cultivars accumulated higher levels of proline than the recent cultivars under water stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Our older cultivars had the capacity to osmotically adjust and to resist drought, whereas for the recent cultivars, the role of proline during stress played a role in preventing hyperosmotic stress [
