<p class="p">According to stress indices (MP, STI and SSI) the group of older cultivars was determined to also be tolerant, whereas recent genotypes were found to be sensitive to water deficit (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The high values of MP and STI were indicative of plant tolerance to water deficiency. The MP and STI were more elevated for the first group, while the SSI recorded for Salim and Maali showed high values.
