<p class="p">A high grain yield is a major goal for the improvement of durum wheat, particularly in drought areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Our results showed that grain yield was significantly higher under irrigated conditions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Excepting the Karim cultivar, which had the highest grain yield, no difference was seen among the other cultivars in well-watered conditions. Statistical data also showed that not all old cultivars had high yields in irrigated conditions. Duncanâ€™s Multiple Range Test (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196873.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) divided all cultivars in 3 groups. The Karim cultivar also had the most elevated grain yield under low water availability. On average, water stress decreased yield by 21.04%. The lowest decrease in grain yield was observed for the old cultivars Nasr99, Karim and Om Rabiaa (10.13%, 16.62% and 19.74%, respectively), making them the most resistant to drought; the modern cultivars Salim and Maali, on the other hand, can be perceived as more sensitive to drought, as they showed decreases of 26.54% and 32.20%, respectively.
