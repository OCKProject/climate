 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], a history of wheat breeding in Tunisia, Karim had an excellent capacity to adapt and a high yield under a wide range of conditions, reaching more than 60% of the national durum wheat area within a few years of its release in 1973. The next released cultivar was Om Rabiaa, which was selected for its good drought tolerance and good straw yield for the semi-arid region. Nasr99 has the highest yield potential under favorable conditions and under water-limited conditions. The area cultivated with Maali is rapidly increasing a few years after the selection, especially in the more humid areas, but not much progress has been made under rainfall conditions. Seed production of Salim started in 2010 and few data were available for this cultivar. Our results showed that genotypes with high grain yields were associated with low effects from water deficit. These results are in agreement with those of [

Moreover, the higher values of grain yield recorded in our study for the oldest cultivars confirm the high accumulation of proline, sugars and peroxidase activity, low electrolyte leakage and slight decrease in Fv/Fm and RWC. Consequently, cultivars able to tolerate water deficit must therefore be able to increase their grain yield. Understanding the physiological basis of yield formation is a fundamental step to providing a more holistic view for plant breeders and increasing the potential productivity of cereals [
