<p class="p">To survive, plants exposed to water deficit develop morphological, physiological and biochemical changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and evolve various adaptive mechanisms against dehydration [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It has been proposed that the critical feature of tolerance to dehydration depends on the ability to limit membrane damage during drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Dehydration was also found to decrease the relative water content of plant leaves [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. To reduce the loss of water, stomata will close in proportion to water stress intensity, which causes progressive limitation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> availability in chloroplasts, consequently reducing the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ratio and the photosynthetic activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Photosynthesis is a major source of energy and results from the interaction of many factors, such as chlorophyll fluorescence [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. This parameter is a potential and simple tool to measure plant response to stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and to evaluate the impact of drought stress on the photosynthetic apparatus [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Osmotic adjustment was also considered to be an important mechanism of drought tolerance in plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In fact, cereals under different environmental stresses accumulate organic solutes with low molecular weights such as sugars, betaine and proline to combat dehydration [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Drought stress induces proline biosynthesis and significantly increases proline content in comparison to control plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. According to [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the amount of soluble sugars, proline concentration and activity of free radical scavenging enzymes increased significantly under stress conditions to combat the accumulation of the reactive oxygen species. All these mechanisms implemented by the plant to fight against the lack of water depend on the species, the cultivar and even the ecotype. To distinguish the different reactions of durum wheat varieties, three old and two recent wheat cultivars were investigated based on certain agro-physiological and biochemical parameters.
