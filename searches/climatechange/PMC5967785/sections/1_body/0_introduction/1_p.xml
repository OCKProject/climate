<p class="p">Cereals have an important place in food security worldwide, particularly in developed countries. Durum wheat is considered a native species in North Africa in general and in Tunisia in particular [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], where durum wheat is grown mainly in sub-humid and semi-arid lands under rainfall conditions. Under these conditions and with climate change now occurring in North African countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], durum wheat production is very low and highly variable. Therefore, a challenge for Tunisia in the coming years is to develop more productive cultivars and to increase durum wheat yield in order to satisfy food requirements. However, Tunisian cereal remains highly dependent on climatic conditions characterized by water scarcity and very frequent drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Yield loss is primarily due to drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Several studies have projected increases in drought severity, extent and duration in many parts of the world under climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Thus, irrigation might be required in these regions to ensure an economically profitable grain yield for farmers.
