<p class="p">Membrane integrity was estimated at heading stage during the 2015–2016 season by measurement of electrolyte leakage using a conductometer. Ten leaf segments of 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> were cut from uppermost fully expanded leaves obtained from the two water treatments (T1: control treatment, and T2: stressed treatment). Segments were rinsed 3 times in order to eliminate surface electrolytes and placed in tubes containing 5 mL of demineralized water in the refrigerator. After 24 hours, the free conductivity of the solution (FC1: control, FC2: stressed) was determined at 25°C. Tubes were then placed in a water bath for 1 h at 90°C to destroy the cell membranes. The total conductivity of the solution (TC1: control, TC2: stressed) was then determined at 25°C. The electrolyte leakage was calculated as
