<p class="p">Relative water content (RWC) of stressed plants leaves was measured at heading stage during the 2015–2016 season. One leaf from the uppermost fully expanded leaves of each cultivar was detached and covered to avoid water loss, then weighed immediately (fresh weight = FW). Leaves were kept for 48 h in Petri dishes on filter-paper discs moistened with distilled water in the refrigerator to determine their turgid weight (TW). Leaves were then kept at room temperature (25° C) for free transpiration. The weight of these excised leaves was recorded, respectively, every one minute for a period of 10 min, every five minutes for a period of 50 min and every fifteen minutes for a period of 30 min. The dry weight (DW) was measured after drying leaves for 48 h at 70°C. RWC was determined as follows:
