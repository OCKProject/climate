<p class="p">The plant material used in this work was represented by five durum wheat cultivars: Karim (Ka), Om Rabiaa (Ou), Nasr99 (Na), Maali (Ma) and Salim (Sa). Karim has been cultivated in Tunisia since 1973 and was registered in the official Tunisian catalog in 1982; Om Rabiaa has been cultivated since 1987 and was registered in the catalog in 1996; Nasr 99 has been cultivated since 1990 and was registered in the catalog in 2004; Maali has been cultivated since 1992 and was registered in the catalog in 2007; and Salim is the most recent cultivar, selected from a cross made in Tunisia in 1993, and was registered in the catalog in 2009 [
