<p class="p">Experiments were conducted in two growing seasons, 2015–2016 and 2016–2017, under two water regimes: irrigated (T1), referred to as control plants, and rainfall (T2), referred to as stressed plants. The experiment was carried out in the research area of the Field Crops Station of INRAT, which is characterized by semi-arid conditions, and was conducted in two blocks as a completely randomized design for irrigated and rainfall trials. Each block was planted in 15 plots (5 cultivars x 3 replicates). Each plot was planted in four rows of four meters (4 m), spaced 0.25 m apart, with an area of 4 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/plot. Grain density was adjusted to 400 grains/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. In the rainfall trials from December 2015 to May 2016, no irrigation was applied throughout (rainfall = 215 mm). In the irrigated trial, irrigation was applied according to plant necessity during the crop life-cycle (approximately 400 mm). Four irrigation treatments were applied, 45 mm each, in December, February, April and May 2015–2016 (rainfall + irrigation: 215 mm + 180 mm = 395 mm). In the second season, from December 2016 to May 2017, the rainfall = 187 mm, and four irrigation applications of 50 mm each were applied to the irrigated trials in February, March, April and May (rainfall + irrigation: 187 mm + 200 mm = 387 mm).
