<p class="p">Specific peroxidase activity (SPA) in the flag leaf was measured at the heading stage during the second season, 2016–2017. A total of 200 mg of the fresh leaves per replicate was divided into two parts: 100 mg was used to determine the dry matter weight; the second part was used to measure the SPA. Following [
