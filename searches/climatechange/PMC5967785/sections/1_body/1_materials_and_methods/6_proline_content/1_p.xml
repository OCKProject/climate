 <xref rid="pone.0196873.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. For each replication, 200 mg of fresh leaves was used and was divided into two parts: 100 mg was used to determine the dry matter weight after oven drying at 70°C for 48 h; the second part was used to measure proline content. The spectrophotometric absorbance was read at 528 nm and proline content calculated to μg/g dry matter.
