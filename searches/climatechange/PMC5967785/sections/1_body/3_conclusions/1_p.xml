<p class="p">The objective of this work was to investigate the morpho-physiological and biochemical responses of durum wheat cultivars to water stress and to evaluate the contrasting physiological responses between old and recent cultivars. When the effects of water deficit were examined, old cultivars were found to have the highest grain yield, whereas recent cultivars performed weakly under these conditions. Old cultivars have been found to be highly productive cultivars and had traits of resistance to drought since their creation; these characteristics were improved over time because these cultivars have originally and over the long-term adapted to their environment. However, the recently created cultivars Maali and Salim have not responded positively to local climatic conditions, despite the many years of testing by breeders and farmers, and this is probably due to an absence of drought traits in them.</p>
