<p class="p">While most species were projected to decline in relative abundance and to shift polewards relative to BC’s marine environment by 2050, species richness along coastal BC was projected to change little under either scenario of climate change. The absolute number of species that occurred within each cell (i.e., with a habitat suitability of greater than zero) reflected gains or losses of up to 3 species per cell. Similar latitudinal patterns to those observed for relative abundance and distribution were again evident, with greater losses in species richness likely to occur towards the southern coast of British Columbia, falling primarily between 48°N and 51°N. Notably, changes in species richness were projected off the coasts of Alaska and California, which mark the northern and southern latitudinal extents of many of the species’ distributions included in this analysis.</p>
