<p class="p">Projections for pelagic species, such as eulachon, Pacific sardines, Pacific herring, and albacore tuna, tended to exhibit the greatest inter-model variability for both latitudinal range shift and relative catch potential estimates (Tables A and B in 
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Text</xref>). In these instances, the DBEM suggested larger estimates than those produced by either of the other two models. For example, the DBEM estimated a 44.4% increase in the relative abundance of Pacific sardines versus the 4.8% and 6.3% increases projected by the other models, while the DBEM projected a decline of 37.1% for eulachon in contrast with the declines of 5.0% and 6.8% estimated by AquaMaps and Maxent, respectively. Given that many of these pelagic species are warmer-water species, theoretical and empirical evidence suggest a northward shift in abundance that would increase catch potential within BCâ€™s waters [
