<p class="p">Conservative estimates of lower- and upper-thresholds of regional losses in annual landed revenue to a selection of First Nations’ commercial fisheries ranged between 6,720,000 and 11,820,000 CAD, translating to a 16.4% to 28.9% reduction in total landed revenue by 2050 based on 2001–2010 median values (

These estimates do not account for impacts on auxiliary industries, such as fish processing and marketing, nor do they account for potential opportunities attained through an increased abundance of lower-latitude species. In particular, commercial sardine fisheries, for which First Nations held 50 per cent (
