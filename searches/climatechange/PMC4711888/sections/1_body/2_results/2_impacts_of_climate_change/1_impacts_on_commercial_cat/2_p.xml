<p class="p">In contrast, an increase in the relative abundance of warmer-water species was projected to lead to new or increased opportunities for commercial harvests by 2050. For instance, catch potential for the commercial Pacific sardine (
 <italic class="italic">Sardinops sagax</italic>) fishery is likely to expand in abundance, with estimates ranging from 42.0 to 44.4% relative to the current baseline within BCâ€™s marine environment. At a more localized scale, estimates indicated that the Heiltsuk intertidal clam fishery for manila clams (
 <italic class="italic">Venerupis philippinarum</italic>) and Pacific littleneck clams (
 <italic class="italic">Protothaca staminea</italic>) may experience slight gains in catch potential under the upper climate change scenario (+8.6%), or experience relative neutrality under the lower scenario (-0.5%).
