<p class="p">A few trends emerged when comparing changes across latitudes (
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.g005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). For instance, projections for DFAs situated along the North and Central Coasts of British Columbia (Gitga’at and Haida, and Heiltsuk and ‘Namgis, respectively) indicated neutral or positive shifts in catch potential for white sturgeon (
