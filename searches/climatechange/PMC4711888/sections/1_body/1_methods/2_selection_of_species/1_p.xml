<p class="p">A sample of culturally and commercially important species was identified from peer-reviewed literature, government and non-governmental organisations’ reports, treaty agreements, and First Nations’ reports. Ninety-eight species—comprising marine and diadromous fish, shellfish, and invertebrates—were selected (sample of species harvested for food, social, and ceremonial [FSC] purposes summarized in

This list is not intended to be a complete representation of the resources used by coastal First Nations or to indicate relative importance, but a summary restricted to a sample of key marine fishes, shellfish and invertebrates harvested by First Nations, as documented in the available literature. While also contributing to First Nations’ traditional harvests, marine mammals, plants and birds were not the focus of this study.
