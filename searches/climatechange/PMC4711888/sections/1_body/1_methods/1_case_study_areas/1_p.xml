 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], First Nations residing along coastal BC vary with respect to culture, traditions and diet associated with their fishing practices, making it inappropriate to assess climate-related impacts on First Nations as if they were a single, homogenous entity [

 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Therefore, First Nations were purposively selected from each of the seven coastal administrative regions defined by the BC First Nations Fisheries Council (FNFC), forming a sample of groups with diverse marine resources, geographical locations, territorial sizes, and treaty statuses. Ultimately, 16 of 78 First Nations identified near BCâ€™s coastline were selected, 12 of which fall under three overarching councils negotiating in the BC treaty process: the Council of the Haida Nation, the Tsimshian Nations Treaty Society, and the Maa-nulth First Nations. For the purpose of this study, these 16 Nations are referred to collectively under their respective treaty councils, with estimated populations recorded as of December 2013
