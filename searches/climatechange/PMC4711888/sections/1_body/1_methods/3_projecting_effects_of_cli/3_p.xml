Ocean properties—including sea surface temperature, sea bottom temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration, surface advection, and net primary production—were projected from NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s IPCC-class earth system model (GFDL ESM2M; [

Based on the outputs from the DBEM, we calculated changes in species’ relative abundances, distributions, and richness, as well as corresponding changes in relative catch potential using species’ relative abundances and projected changes in primary productivity for each cell (methods based on [
