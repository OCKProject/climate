This study progresses a step further by projecting plausible quantitative scenarios of how coastal First Nations’ key marine resources might be affected by climate change, identifying corresponding fisheries management challenges that would likely emerge under these scenarios, and discussing potential adaptive responses to these specific challenges informed by traditional fisheries management strategies. To achieve this, a SDM driven by outputs from global coupled ocean-atmosphere-biogeochemistry earth system models was used to project changes in potential yields of species targeted by coastal First Nations’ fisheries under climate change. With reference to these results, we discuss potential climate-resilient pathways that draw from examples of First Nations’ traditional fisheries management strategies.
