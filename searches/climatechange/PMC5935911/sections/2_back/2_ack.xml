 <p class="p">We greatly thank Don Marco Arturo Valderrama for his kind hospitality and for encouraging us to conduct the community workshops. Special thanks to Don Luís Hernándo Barón and Don Jorge Raúl Carvajal Duarte for providing us some of the pictures we published here (Figs. 
  <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
  <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and Don Jairo Carreño and Pastor Correa for their guidance in the beautiful páramos. We also thank the dean of 
  <italic class="italic">La Normal</italic> school in Güicán, Pastor Zambrano Salazar, for giving us consent to organize the activities with the children and the youth students, as well as the teacher Milton Real for facilitating this collaboration and Doña Luz Dary to set up the workshops with the women. We are grateful to all the inhabitants of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy-Güicán for sharing with us their precious time, knowledge, meals, support, and kindness. This study would not have been possible without their participation, and it should benefit their needs promoting the conservation of their beloved homeland. We greatly thank Carlos Parra, Adolfo Jara Muñoz, and both the COL and ANDES staff for its logistic support and for hosting our plant collections. We also thank Dr. Jorge Luís Ceballos for his kind support during our fieldwork time and his valuable friendship.
