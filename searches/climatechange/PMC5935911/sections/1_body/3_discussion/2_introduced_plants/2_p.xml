<p id="Par39" class="p">In contrast to the indigenous community in the South Colombian páramo La Ortiga [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], most of the useful native plants (97%, including endemic species) in our study were found in páramo areas (from 3500 m). Only 3% of the useful native plants were found below this distribution range while 77% where found in the high Andean forest range (3200–4000) in La Ortiga [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Unlike in the neighboring municipality of Guacamayas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], most of the useful plants in the SN Cocuy-Güicán were collected from the wild (59%), some were cultivated (28%), and few were gathered from both wild and cultivated sources (12%). All cultivated plants were introduced species, while plants that were both wild and cultivated were either naturalized exotics (fodder species like 
 <italic class="italic">Dactylis glomerata</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium pratense</italic>) or native species used for restoration by the NNP-Cocuy staff. These percentages of native versus introduced species were almost equal to the values found in Villa de Leyva [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] for the total of useful plants. By contrast, the proportion of native medicinal plants in the SN Cocuy-Güicán was a little higher than in Guacamayas [
