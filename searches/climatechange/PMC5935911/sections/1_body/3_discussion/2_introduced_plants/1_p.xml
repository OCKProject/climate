<p id="Par38" class="p">Comparable to other studies on Andean ethnobotany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], the proportion of native plants used by our study group (68%) was more than twice the number of introduced species. However, the farmers in the SNN-Cocuy used a considerable proportion of introduced plants to feed their cattle (55%), for consumption (44%), and to heal themselves (40%). Plantations of introduced trees like 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus patula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> have displaced and decreased the natural resources of native useful plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Pine plantations cause soil acidification and water loss, which affects the original vegetation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. However, introduced species also have become important for the subsistence of local farmers in the provision of food, medicine, and fodder. Although the discontinued use of native species may erode the traditional plant knowledge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], the input of introduced plant medicine can also enrich the local pharmacopeia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. This was also observed in our study area, where many introduced medicinal species (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> spp.
 <italic class="italic">, Origanum</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Calendula officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Borago officinalis</italic>) were cultivated in house yards or purchased at the market, so their presence may have a limited impact on the natural environment.
