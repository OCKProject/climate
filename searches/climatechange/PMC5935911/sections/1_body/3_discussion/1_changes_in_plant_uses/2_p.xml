<p id="Par37" class="p">The campesinos in the SN Cocuy-Güicán retained substantial knowledge about plants used for their wood, but in contrast with the local inhabitants of Villa de Leyva [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], the demand in this category was much lower, probably because the collection of native woody species for construction, fencing, or firewood had been restricted in the páramos by the park authorities. As logging activities in the park were prohibited, plastic, metal, and other building materials were now more popular than before. The restrictive policies in the páramo and superpáramo emerged from the unsustainable exploitation of some plant resources (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Espeletia spp.</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polylepis quadrijuga</italic>), which were used for firewood, to make fences or to build houses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The consequence of this large-scale extraction in the past, especially during the ninetieth and twentieth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] and the legal prohibitions afterwards, is that many traditional plant uses have been abandoned. The same native woody species, however, were now used for restoration projects by the employees of the NNP-Cocuy.
