Other plants were consumed fresh to obtain energy and alleviate the thirst during high physical demand activities in the mountains, such as the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Echeveria bicolor</italic>, bulbs of 
 <italic class="italic">Cyrtochilum revolutum</italic>, the entire lichens of 
 <italic class="italic">Thamnolia vermicularis</italic>, and fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium floribundum</italic>. Potatoes (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic>) and long onions (
 <italic class="italic">Allium fistulosum</italic>) were the most popular crops cultivated in the SN Cocuy-Güicán, both grown for home-consumption and the market. Lesser crops were peas (
 <italic class="italic">Pisum sativum</italic>) and broad beans (
 <italic class="italic">Vicia faba</italic>), but these were sometimes also purchased in the markets. Maize and wheat were cultivated for subsistence in a few plots.
