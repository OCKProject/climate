 <italic class="italic">Gynoxys paramuna</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Halenia gentianoides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pentacalia guicanensis</italic>). Most of the introduced useful plants were originally from Europe, like

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), of which the spiny inflorescences are used by farmers to clean their “ruanas,” the typical Boyaca ponchos made from sheep wool. We found more native plants in the categories wood (90%), dyes (70%), rituals (69%), and domestic tools (78%) than in those used as medicine (60%), food (56%), and fodder (46%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Although most useful plants (66%) were native to the páramo, some local people stated that it was easier to cultivate medicinal plants in their home yards (mostly introduced species) than climbing up the mountain to collect species from the wild.
