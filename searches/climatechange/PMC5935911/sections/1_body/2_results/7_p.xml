<p id="Par29" class="p">When the settlers brought livestock to the Andean p치ramos, many exotic plants from Europe were introduced as fodder. Examples are 
 <italic class="italic">Dactylis glomerata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pennisetum clandestinum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne</italic>. The colonization and expansion of these grasses have been stimulated with the increase of grazing areas, created by clearing and burning patches of p치ramo vegetation and cutting large areas of Andean forest, causing paramisation. P치ramo species quickly pioneering arrive first and with them also native weedy species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Paspalum bonplandianum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lachemilla orbiculata</italic>, and species of 
 <italic class="italic">Juncus</italic>, which are rare in pristine p치ramo. Also other exotic species arrived with them such as 
 <italic class="italic">Hypochaeris radicata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Digitalis purpurea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rumex acetosella</italic> (pioneering after potato harvest), 
 <italic class="italic">R. obtusifolius</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium pretense.</italic>
