<p id="Par35" class="p">During the three workshops, we observed great enthusiasm among all groups and high participation rates when exchanging plant knowledge, which could reinforce the community bonds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. We left two posters with 20 dried plant specimens in the 
 <italic class="italic">Esperanza</italic> farmhouse (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and the 
 <italic class="italic">Capilla</italic> social building. Such “herbarium posters” visualized useful native plants and created awareness of the diversity and richness of the local floristic resources, which can help to increase conservation efforts by local people and tourists. During the workshop with the primary schools of our study site, we asked all children (20) to draw and write the names of three plants they considered most important to them. The pine tree (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus patula</italic>) emerged as the most popular plant, followed by the “frailejón” (
 <italic class="italic">Espeletia</italic> spp.), the “aguadera” orchid (
 <italic class="italic">Cyrtochilum revolutum</italic>), the “curuba” vine (
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora mixta</italic>), and the succulent “chupahuevo” (
 <italic class="italic">Echeveria bicolor</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The numerous citations of páramo plants showed that children were connected to their high altitude environment and that retention of ancestral plant knowledge was present to a certain degree, although most of them considered an introduced tree (
 <italic class="italic">P. patula</italic>) as the most relevant one, probably because of its abundance in their environment.
