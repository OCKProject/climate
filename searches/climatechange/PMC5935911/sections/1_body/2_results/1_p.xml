<p id="Par23" class="p">We conducted 76 interviews (35 women, 41 men) and collected 149 specimens, including 143 vascular plants, three lichens, two bryophytes, and one mushroom. In total, we recorded 174 useful species, grouped in 126 genera and 59 families, which corresponded to 178 vernacular names. Scientific names had mostly Greek and Latin roots, but at least 23 names were derived from the Amerindian Muisca and Laches’ languages (ancestors of the U’wa group), belonging to the Macrochibcha linguistic family [

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The most species-rich family was Compositae (30 spp.) followed by Lamiaceae (12), Poaceae (10), Rosaceae (9), Apiaceae (8), Solanaceae (7), and Leguminosae (6). Most species (108 spp.) had medicinal uses, followed by species used for food, wood and domestic uses. Similar percentages were observed for dye plants, restoration, and ritual plants, while fewer species are used as fodder (Fig.
