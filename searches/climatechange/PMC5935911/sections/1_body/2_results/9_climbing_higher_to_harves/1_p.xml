 <italic class="italic">Lepidium bipinnatifidum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora mixta</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Acaena elongata</italic> were more difficult to find and had shifted to higher altitudes. These changes could be caused by climate change, as the temperatures have increased 2 °C in the SN Cocuy-Güicán in less than four decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] and the páramo vegetation tends to colonize areas above their distribution range in response of climate warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Farmers reported that the weather was already unpredictable and the decrease of the snow causing water shortage affected the vegetation, including their crops. They indicated that crops like maize and wheat were now cultivated at higher altitudes. One farmer reported: “50 years ago, some cultivars were planted in a specific time of the year, nowadays they can be planted all year because the climate has changed.” Another farmer commented: “This [climate change] can be good in some sense, for those who have water to maintain them, but we cannot predict the weather anymore.”
