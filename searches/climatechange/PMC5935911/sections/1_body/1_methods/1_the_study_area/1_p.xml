 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), located in the highest summits of the Cordillera Oriental (between 6° 26′ 0″ N and 72° 17′ 0″ W) within the Departments Boyacá and Arauca. The natural vegetation on the west side of the Sierra Nevada ranges from xerophytic forest (600 m asl) to páramo in the alpine zone, with the highest peak in the Ritak’uwa Blanco (5380 m). The SN Cocuy-Güicán’s páramo ecosystem is divided in three vegetation zones: grass páramo (3900–4350 m), subpáramo (3500–3900 m), and superpáramo above 4350 to the snow cap [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. The high Andean forest corresponds in large part to a “paramisation” zone (3300 to 3500 m), where the forest is replaced by herbaceous páramo-like vegetation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. The Andean forest is located between about 2500 to 3300 m. Glacial lakes are numerous: the largest ones are the Laguna Grande de la Sierra (4450 m), La Plaza (4200 m), La Cuadrada (4042 m), and the Laguna Grande de los Verdes (3975 m). The climate is typical of páramo ecosystems: cold at night and warmer during daytime, frosting in the superpáramo zone, with influence of trade winds from the Atlantic and the Amazon basin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Precipitation contrasts between the eastern and western slopes and no thermal seasonality occurs, except for the annual confluence of dry and rain season. The mean maximum temperature has increased 2 °C in 34 years (1976–2010) [
