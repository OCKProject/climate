<p id="Par22" class="p">Ethnobotanical studies are based on active participation of the local population. Therefore, ethnobotanists should compensate local people for their collaboration, taking into account their needs to promote conservation projects and improve the community well-being [

On the request from one of our local collaborators, we organized three dynamic workshops towards the end of our fieldwork, during which we used fresh plants, a poster with 20 dried native specimens glued on it, and our own field-collected material to explain ethnobotanical concepts and methods to the farmer communities. The workshops were entitled “What is the use of this plant? Useful plants of the SN Cocuy-Güicán: sharing the ancestral knowledge of its inhabitants.” The workshops allowed us to share the ethnobotanical data acquired through this research with the community and highlight the value of their botanical heritage to less knowledgeable community members (youth, migrants). Workshops were directed to all children (varying in age from ca. 9 years old, 20 children, 4 girls, 16 boys) from three primary schools of the

 <italic class="italic">La Normal</italic> school in Güicán town (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We focused on these groups to increase social diversity and inclusion, as we worked mainly with adult men during our field surveys. During the activities, we shared the preliminary results of our field research, so local participants benefited from the exchange of knowledge and we also gathered new information on plants for which our data were unclear. We also encouraged the participants to be “Ethnobotanists for a day”, applying our methodology: pressing specimens, asking their partners about plant information, and labelling the vouchers with uses and names. In addition, we discussed about local concerns regarding declining plant resources and changes in traditional plant use.
