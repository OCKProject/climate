<p id="Par21" class="p">We organized our data in an Excel table (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) with the following information: collector, collection number, collection date, geographical coordinates, family, scientific name, specialist who identified the specimen, plant description, collection locality, domestication status, native or introduced, habit, habitat, vernacular names, language, uses (parts used, preparation, application or illnesses treated), and name of the informants. We consulted the 
 <italic class="italic">Catálogo de Plantas de Colombia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] to know whether a plant was native, endemic, or introduced and we checked the plant list [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] for the current scientific names according to the APG III system. We categorized plant uses in medicinal (including veterinary uses), food (including seasonings), wood (including firewood, construction, fences, and tools), domestic (including handicrafts and decorative items), fodder, ritual, dye, and restoration. The latter category included those species that were used to restore disturbed páramo ecosystem. We also asked for the campesinos’ perspectives and personal experiences related to climate change and plant availability.
