<p id="Par16" class="p">We expected that local farmers would use a large number of plants because they rely on their natural resources since the colonial era. We anticipated to find a greater proportion of native species than in nearby Andean areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], as the SN Cocuy-Güicán is a quite isolated mountain with high levels of plant diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. We also expected a reduced availability of plant resources due to overharvesting practices. We hypothesized that farmers had to collect plants from higher altitudes than in the past as a consequence of climate change and vegetation zones moving upwards [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. We hope that this study will provide international support to preserve the cultural heritage and the fragile páramos of the SN Cocuy-Güicán. Our inventory serves as a basis for implementing projects on environmental education and sustainable development, such as ethnobotanical field trails for children and tourists, and useful plant workshops in schools or community groups.
