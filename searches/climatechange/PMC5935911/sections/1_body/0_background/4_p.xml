<p id="Par10" class="p">In the SN Cocuy-Güicán, the ecological effects of the post-colonial land use changes are clearly visible. First native species were exploited like 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus humboldtii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polylepis quadrijuga</italic>. Later on, in deforested areas, there was a shift to introduced species like 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus patula</italic> to produce wood for construction, fuel, and paper production. European and North American grasses (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Dactylis glomerata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne</italic>) and a tropical African grass (
 <italic class="italic">Pennisetum clandestinum</italic>) were introduced as fodder. Besides farming activities, tourism as a source of income increased considerable in the last decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Recent complaints by campesinos and indigenous groups about unsustainable and destructive practices by tourists led to the closure of the National Park from the February 2016 to April 2017, until new policies were introduced. The tropical highland ecosystem of the SN Cocuy-Güicán is vulnerable to climate change effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] pointed out that local farmers’ plant knowledge is intertwined with the U’wa indigenous group, we documented the ethnoflora of the campesinos and tried to detect potential declining resources and their relation to climate change. We posed the following questions:
