<p class="p">Stacked distributions to explore species overlap predictions also suggest that deforestation has a greater effect on annual loss than climate change. For instance, areas with higher species overlap (13 to 17 species) decrease at approximately 34 km

Moreover, in southwestern Ecuador, deforestation seem to reduce the number of species at all elevations, while the future climate scenario appears to shrink species overlaps primarily at higher altitudes and not in the lowlands, where projections show an increase in the number of overlapping species. In addition, the spatial deforestation hotspot does not coincide with the hotspot of species loss attributed to climate change (Figure D in
