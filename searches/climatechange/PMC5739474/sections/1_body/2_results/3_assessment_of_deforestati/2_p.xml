<p class="p">For all 17 tree species except 
 <italic class="italic">Cavanillesia platanifolia</italic>, deforestation consistently represents a greater threat in reducing distribution areas compared with climate change (CCSM4.0, RCP 8.5, 2050). Our annual loss estimates from deforestation ranged from approximately 9 to 200 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year across species, while estimated annual loss from climate change ranged from 4 to 60 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year. Results from the paired t-test identified a significant difference between the distribution-loss associated with deforestation and the loss attributed to climate change (p-value = 0.001, t = 3.93, and df = 16). Similarly, t-tests for landscape variables also showed significance, particularly for landscape cover (p-value &lt; 0.0001), edge length (p-value = 0.01), number of patches (p-value = 0.0002), and mean patch area (p-value &lt; 0.0001) (

 <italic class="italic">Albizia multiflora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ceiba trichstandra</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cochlospermum vitifoliu</italic> that might be susceptible to additional climate change pressure, which strongly affects the area and number of patches of these species.
