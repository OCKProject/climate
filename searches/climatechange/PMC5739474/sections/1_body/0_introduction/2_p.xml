<p class="p">Ecuador, one of the ten most biodiversity-rich nations in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], has one-sixth of its territory covered by deciduous and semi-deciduous forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] with a reported national deforestation rate of approximately 30 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year during 2008–2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. A high proportion of Ecuador’s seasonally dry forests is located in the southwestern part of the country, situated in the Tumbes–Chocó–Magdalena region and adjacent to the Tropical Andes, two large biodiversity hotspots with great species diversity and high levels of species endemism, but also with high habitat loss caused by land-use change [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Moreover, these dry forests are particularly susceptible because they are highly fragmented, less than 2.3% of their areas are represented in natural reserves [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and almost all major conservation threats are linked to habitat degradation [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Moreover, these forests not only provide timber and non-timber forest products, but also key ecosystem services such as water flux balance and erosion prevention.
