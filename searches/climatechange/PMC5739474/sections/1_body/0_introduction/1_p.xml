<p class="p">Seasonally dry tropical ecosystems have harbored humans for thousands of years. The Americas are no exception because these ecosystems have historically been the preferred zones for settlement and agriculture [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Due to these and other anthropogenic influences, neotropical seasonally dry forests are the most threatened tropical forests in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], which similarly to other dry areas, could be at risk of degradation due to the effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The latest estimates indicate that two-thirds of original neotropical dry forest has been converted to other types of land uses [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Some authors argue that the combination of anthropogenic pressure, variability in climatic conditions, and climate change makes tropical dry forests particularly vulnerable regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Of these threats, climate change is perhaps the greatest uncertainty as it might cause species extinctions, range shifts, and biodiversity loss [
