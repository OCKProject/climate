<p class="p">Furthermore, for efficient planning, implementation of conservation measures, and sustainable land use, prioritizing efforts according to threats and vulnerabilities is important. Therefore, it is critical to differentiate between potential climate change and deforestation threats, identifying patterns at both species and community levels. In this study, we use species distribution models to estimate and compare potential climate change threats with current deforestation patterns for a characteristic plant community of 17 tree species in the seasonally dry forest of Ecuador. We hypothesize that (a) deforestation differ in magnitude and spatial distribution from potential range shifts due to climate change; (b) both patterns do not exhibit species-specific effects; and (c) individual species responses reveal a convergent pattern, maintaining community structure. In this study, we aim to provide a scientific reference frame to identify the lesser of two evils and provide a basis for effective resource allocation in forest conservation and sustainable land use.</p>
