 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. However, given that individual species are expected to have different range shifts depending on internal and external traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], quantifying the magnitude and direction of these shifts is important in assessing whether the current species composition will remain constant or disaggregate with future changes. Convergent changes could indicate that ecosystem compositions will remain stable (assuming equal displacement ability) while divergent patterns may indicate new ecosystem compositions, with unknown consequences on synecology, ecosystem functions, and thus ecosystem services. In this regard, a meaningful approach using a response-and-effect functional framework was suggested by Suding et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] to minimize these uncertainties.
