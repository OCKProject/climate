<p class="p">The outcomes of the environmental niche modeling were converted to binary-type using the 10% training presence threshold as the absence criteria. Analyses of rasters, vectors, and area calculations were performed using QGIS 2.2.0, including the principal component analysis through the python plugin PCA v0.3. Model evaluation was performed by the area under the receiver-operator (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC), a debated, but prevalent rank-based metric to assess predicted distribution model accuracy [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This metric is the probability that a random presence locality is ranked higher than a random absence location. An AUC value of 0.5 indicates that the prediction is not better than random; &lt; 0.5 is worse than random; 0.5–0.7 indicates poor performance; 0.7–0.9 represents reasonable or moderate performance; and &gt; 0.9 signifies high performance [
