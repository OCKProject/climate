<p class="p">The environmental niche modeling was produced with Maxent v3.3, a widely used algorithm for assessing species distributions that can rely on presence-only data and retain a strong predictive power compared to other approaches [

We programmed the console to run 5 replicates of each model and left the remaining settings at default values.
