<p class="p">According to the criteria of Aguirre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], we selected all characteristic tree species of the dry deciduous forest on hillsides of southwestern Ecuador, excluding predominantly shrub life-forms [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190092.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). All 17 tree species are used as local timber or other wood products [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], and although these species are categorized as distinctive of the area, they do not exclusively occur in this region [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Presence records were obtained from the GBIF database [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and complemented with inventory data from our permanent plots as well as herbarium records at the Universidad Nacional de Loja (
