In addition, the following three topographical variables were used: soil classification based on the USDA denominations; absolute depth to bedrock; and soil organic carbon stock. All three variables were obtained from

The chosen future scenario was the most extreme possible outcome for 2050 and utilized the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 from the global circulation model CCSM4.0 in accordance with the fifth intergovernmental panel on climate change assessment report [
