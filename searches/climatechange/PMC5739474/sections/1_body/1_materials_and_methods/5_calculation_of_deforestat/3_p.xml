<p class="p">To summarize and visually compare the changes in distribution attributed to deforestation and climate change, we calculated the core distributional shifts (i.e., area centroids) for each species according to two time frames: 2008–2014 and 2014–2050. For this, we used SDMtoolbox [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], a python-based GIS toolkit for automating analyses in ecology and species distribution models. This analysis reduces the distribution area to a single point and creates a line that represents the magnitude and direction of change. In this section, climate change vector lengths were corrected to reflect six years of change to match the deforestation time interval.
