<p class="p">To calculate the deforestation and climate change metrics affecting each species, we used 2008 and 2014 public land-cover and land-use data from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment that is available in digital cartography form [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Next, we used forest loss and/or remnant native forest information to mask the binary outcomes of individual species distribution models, for both present and future models. Thus, we obtained species-specific approximations of the affected area for the periods: 2008–2014 and 2014–2050. Given that estimated area loss attributed to deforestation was calculated for a 6-year period and the area threatened by climate change was determined for a 36-year period, we standardized values by calculating annual rates of loss and compared values for all 17 species using a paired t-test.
