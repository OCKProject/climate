<p class="p">Distribution area measurements and landscape metrics for each species were computed by the python plugin LecoS v2.0.7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], an alternative to the more comprehensive FRAGSTATS, that has the advantage of working within the QGIS processing framework. For this, we transformed the deforestation and climate change masked outputs to raster format using a 250 Ã— 250 m cell size, which set the minimum detectable area for any landscape metric to 0.0625 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. In addition, we also superimposed (i.e., stacked) species distributions in native forests that were unthreatened by climate change, to evaluate how the modeled species overlap differed from the deforestation and climate change threats.
