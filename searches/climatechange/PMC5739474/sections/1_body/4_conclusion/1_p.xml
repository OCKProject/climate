<p class="p">Using presence-only modeling and native forest masks from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment, we obtained approximations of characteristic tree species distributions in the dry deciduous forest of southwestern Ecuador, which are threatened by deforestation and climate change. Our estimates indicate that deforestation affects more spatial range than climate change, even under an extreme climate change scenario. Despite this result, climate change may cause additional stress at the species and community levels. Special attention to 
 <italic class="italic">Albizia multiflora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ceiba trichistandra</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cochlospermum vitifolium</italic> populations may be required because our results reveal that these species are vulnerable to both deforestation and climate change. The diverging displacement shifts of a large number of species may indicate the commencement of plant community disaggregation and a transition toward novel ecosystems. However, further research is required to discern the effects on the synecology, resilience, and ecosystem services of dry forest ecosystems.
