<p class="p">Our results indicate that the effects of climate change result bigger in terms of distributional shifts but that deforestation affects more surface area. Therefore, as climate change adaptation and deforestation reduction measures in Ecuador likely will not match spatially, deforestation reduction should be prioritized over climate change adaptation. Similar cases of habitat loss due to these two threats may be occurring in other ecosystems in the Tropics, where annual deforestation rates are considerably far more severe [
