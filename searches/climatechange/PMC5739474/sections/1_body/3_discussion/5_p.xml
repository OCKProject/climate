<p class="p">In summary, in terms of relative area change, deforestation and climate change represented average annual area reductions of 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Thus, in terms of spatial coverage and effect severity, deforestation may pose a higher threat to species distributions than climate change. However, the spatial disaggregation of both processes indicates that climate change may affect a greater number of forest areas, which are not subject to conversion.</p>
