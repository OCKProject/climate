<p class="p">According to a study based on satellite and aerial photography data, deforestation in southwestern Ecuador dry deciduous forests was approximately 29 and 57 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year from 1976 to 1989 and 1989 to 2008, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, official reports indicate a 15 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year mean annual deforestation rate between 2008 and 2014 across the study area (i.e., environmental space used during modeling) [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. According to our species distribution models, the average deforestation loss for the 17 tree species reached 71 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year (± 43.9 SD). Our results support previous direct and indirect measurements that identified deforestation as the greatest threat to dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Conversely, our area loss calculations resulting from climate change projections reached 21 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year (± 26.4 SD) for the same tree species without accounting for potential distribution gain (i.e., potential new favorable areas). For instance, the difference in area-changes attributed to deforestation and climate remained statistically significant when we limited the comparison to potential area loss (excluding area gain) from the future climate scenario. Area gain can be disregarded owing to low regeneration processes and conflicting land uses that might strongly inhibit natural succession.
