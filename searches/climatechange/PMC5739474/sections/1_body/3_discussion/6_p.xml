<p class="p">Moreover, our species overlap results in the future climate scenario (Figure D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190092.s002" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>) indicate reductions in high overlap (13–17 species) areas and expansions in low and medium overlap areas (1–6 and 7–12 species), in particular, at elevations below 1000 m in southwestern Ecuador. The apparent progression into the lowlands can be explained by the future increase in the precipitation predictor variables (e.g., bio16 and bio17), considering that other climate models also predict a precipitation increment in this area [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Finally, the magnitude and direction of the core distributional shifts differ by threat and species; this fact supports the notion of climate change pushing towards novel species compositions [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. One explanation for the observed divergent directions of deforestation and climate change may be that each threat has different underlying mechanisms; deforestation pressure is determined by land use, access roads, and other density-dependent human factors, while climate change pressure is estimated solely by changes in environmental variables and responses will depend on species-specific evolutionary histories and physiological requirements. Furthermore, northward or southward species migrations might be the only possible routes for species in southwestern Ecuador given the altitude in these paths gradually increases, while two major geographic barriers, the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, lie to its East and West, respectively.
