<p class="p">Furthermore, as our projections predict range expansions for some species and range contractions for others (in addition to the range shifts induced by deforestation and climate), tree species distributions are potentially susceptible to a myriad of unpredictable community-level effects. Thus, as an alternative to evaluating the effects of species re-assemblage on the dry forests, we propose a functional traits approach that emphasizes at the level of response traits and effect traits. As derived by Suding et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], when the geographical displacement of each response group contains species from each effect group, ecosystem function resilience is expected. Conversely, the occurrence of new species assemblages under future climate scenarios may have consequences for the provision of supporting services, as well as regulating services. For instance, Sakschewski et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] provided theoretical evidence that plant trait diversity may enable large-scale ecosystems to adjust to new climate conditions through competition. Moreover, in the particular case of novel combination of species, Lugo [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] asserted that tropical novel forests might behave similarly to native forests, specifically in terms of soil protection, nutrient cycles, wildlife support, carbon storage, and watershed function maintenance. Thus, we believe that changes in species composition in the dry deciduous forests of Ecuador represent challenges for forest management and requires exploration of new strategies to maintain the long-term provision of ecosystem services.
