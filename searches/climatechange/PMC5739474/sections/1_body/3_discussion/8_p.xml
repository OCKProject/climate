<p class="p">Measures to avoid deforestation should be promoted in a deforestation hotspot in the southernmost coastal region [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] and below 1000 m of elevation according to our study. Concurrently, conservation should be encouraged in the southwestern border with Peru [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], where our results predict the highest concentration of species of this forest type. Further research must incorporate deforestation data and modeling scenarios for northern Peru where the underlying causes for deforestation are similar [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], and social processes such as demographics, economics, and policy play an important role [
 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Therefore, strategies to avoid deforestation and promote conservation include expanding protected areas, biological corridors, species-specific timber use regulations and flagship species valorizations (e.g.,
