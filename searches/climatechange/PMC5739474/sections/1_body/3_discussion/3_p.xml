<p class="p">With regards to model validation, we focused on the operational capability of the outputs rather than testing their inferences about the real system (e.g., Rykiel [

 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In all cases, we obtained high AUC values with considerably low replicate variation (&lt; 0.07 SD), which is half of the recommended value by other studies for “accurate and stable” models that meet practical needs [
