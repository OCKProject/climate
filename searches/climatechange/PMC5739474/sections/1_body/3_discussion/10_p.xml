 <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], we recommend a special focus on sustainable management practices and gene pool conservation. With regard to species heavily threatened by deforestation and with high and valuable usage as timber and wood products (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Cordia macrantha</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Guazuma ulmifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Handroanthus chrysanthus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Prosopis juliflora</italic>), we recommend species-specific measures for their conservation, such as potential genecological zone identification, potential subpopulation evaluation, and gene pool variability tests. In combination with enrichment planting efforts, additional measures for sustainable management of these species include the establishment of seed orchards and in vitro propagation.
