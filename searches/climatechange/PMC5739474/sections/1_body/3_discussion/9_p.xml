The results of this study can be used as an additional resource for decision-making regarding the improvement or expansion of existing protected areas and biological corridors. For instance, there is almost no mid to high altitude (100â€“1000 m) land under conservation in southwestern Ecuador with the exception of scarce private reserves such as La Ceiba and Laipuna. Our study highlights conservation area weaknesses in southern Ecuador, in agreement with Cuesta et al. [
