  <title class="title">Stacked model projections of 17 characteristic trees species of Ecuadorian dry deciduous forests.</title>
  <p class="p">Potential species presence was based on 2014 native forest remnants. Low, moderate, and high species overlaps represent 1–6, 7–12, and 13–17 species, respectively. Pattern fill illustrates the natural areas protected by the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador [
   <xref rid="pone.0190092.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], excluding strictly maritime areas, mangroves, and recreational areas, as well as private protected areas. Numbered regions highlight the protected areas within the dry deciduous forest (1. Reserva Ecologica Arenillas, 2. Parque Nacional Machalilla, and 3. Refugio de Vida Silvestre Pacoche). Enlarged image on the right emphasizes potential species overlap in southwestern Ecuador.
