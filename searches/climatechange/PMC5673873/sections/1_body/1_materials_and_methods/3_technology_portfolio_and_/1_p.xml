<p id="Par24" class="p">To assess the economic viability we start by applying a bottom-up cost estimation exercise to estimate the cost associated with the different production technologies. Our cost estimates reflect an ex-ante assessment from an engineering perspective. In that sense, our cost estimates do not take into account any unforeseen ex-post developments. We estimate individually the cost contributions for the individual building blocks of the production technologies: fixed production facilities, shallow water production facilities, floating production facilities, and subsea production facilities.
