<p id="Par23" class="p">Finally, the annual variability of sea ice thickness is shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> for the summer minimum in September and the winter maximum in March. Note, that the CCSM4 and the NorESM1-ME simulate thicker ice in September than in March in 2010 and 2026, respectively. These September ice thickness maxima of about 2.2 m are based on local thick ice flows southeast of Franz Josef Land (CCSM4) and northwest of Novaya Zemlya (NorESM1-ME). Greater thickness in late summer compared to the end of winter indicates severe shortcomings of the models, most likely due to spatial resolution and the representation of sea ice dynamics. The annual variabilities of the MPI-ESM-LR and the GFDL-CM3 are much smaller than those of the CCSM4 and the NorESM1-ME. However, the magnitude of the annual variability in all models is larger than their long-term decrease until 2040.
