<p id="Par9" class="p">A significant share of the world’s undiscovered oil and natural gas resources is assumed to lie under the seabed of the Arctic Ocean. The US Geological Survey estimates that “about 30% of the world’s undiscovered gas and 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil” are north of the Arctic Circle, including onshore resources (Gautier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2009</xref>). Up until now, the exploitation of the resources especially under the European Arctic has largely been prevented by the challenges posed by temporary sea ice coverage, harsh weather conditions, darkness, remoteness of the fields, and lack of infrastructure such as Search and Rescue (SAR) facilities. The need for special equipment, suitable for winter operation, including ships and platforms, and the long distance to existing infrastructure make exploration and production activities in the Arctic Ocean especially costly compared to other, even non-conventional sources of hydrocarbons. Consequently, competition by less expensive supply options has led producers to leave European Arctic resources so far largely untapped.
