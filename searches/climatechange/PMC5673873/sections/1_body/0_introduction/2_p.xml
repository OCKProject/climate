<p id="Par10" class="p">Gradual warming has, however, improved the accessibility of the Arctic Ocean and raised hopes among hydrocarbon producers that envisage a diversification of their portfolios away from less politically stable or depleting sources elsewhere. Also, oil and gas importers in Europe are interested in reduced dependence on traditional suppliers in Russia, the Middle East, or Africa that are perceived as geopolitically risky. At the same time, environmentalists see the pristine Arctic ecosystems in danger of pollution by oil and gas production facilities and associated infrastructure. Also, the long-term need of fossil fuels given the Paris Agreement and international climate protection goals question the rationale of exploiting Arctic fuel resources. The implications of additional production of energy resources from the European Arctic on the environment, energy markets, and geopolitics warrants a closer look on whether, where, and under which conditions additional Arctic offshore oil and gas production is desirable.</p>
