 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows recent developments in the world market prices for oil and gas, with which Arctic offshore gas and oil would have to compete. Note that our cost estimates, which are below the current world market price for oil and at least the average gas price in Europe, do not take into account a number of relevant cost components. This includes internal interest requirements, risk premiums, political costs, e.g., for concession levies, or exploration and planning expenditures. These elements, however, might change the results to a certain degree, but not in general. Also, additional, location-dependent and highly uncertain costs for local infrastructure provision in the widely undeveloped Arctic may not have been fully taken into account in our estimations. Finally, while the reduction of sea ice might facilitate access to the Arctic Ocean, it will also likely have an impact on especially wave conditions in the once ice-covered areas, which may increase production costs. Under these circumstances and with market prices below or just above our estimated production costs we conclude that, based on our cost estimates, the large estimated quantities remain untapped as long as purely economic reasons determine the development decision.
