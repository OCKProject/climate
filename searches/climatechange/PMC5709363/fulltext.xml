Techniques involving <italic>in-situ</italic> rocket measurements, remote optical observations, and radio wave reflection experiments have produced conflicting results. This study reports a novel technique that analyses long-distance subionospheric very low frequency radiowave observations of the NAA 24.0&#x02009;kHz transmitter, Cutler, Maine, made from Halley Station, Antarctica, over the period 1971&#x02013;2016. The analysis is insensitive to any changes in the output power of the transmitter, compensates for the use of different data logging equipment, and can confirm the accuracy of the timing systems operated over the 45 year long record. A ~10% reduction in the scale size of the transmitter nighttime interference fringe pattern has been determined, taking into account the quasi-11 year solar cycle. Subionospheric radiowave propagation modeling suggests that the contraction of the interference fringe pattern about the mid-latitude NAA transmitter is due to a 3&#x02009;km reduction in the effective height of the nighttime ionospheric D-region over the last 45 years. This is consistent with the effect of enhanced infra-red cooling by increasing greenhouse gases.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The long term increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere during the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries are expected to drive an increase in temperature in the troposphere, i.e., 0&#x02013;~15&#x02009;km altitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Rocketsonde measurements undertaken at tropical and sub-tropical locations have confirmed the cooling trends for 35&#x02013;50&#x02009;km, and provided additional observations of long-term cooling trends up to 63&#x02009;km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. At these altitudes long-term changes of stratospheric ozone concentration can influence the cooling trends observed by up to a third<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> particularly at high polar latitudes associated with the ozone hole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

A comprehensive synthesis and evaluation of mesospheric long-term temperature trends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> confirmed the occurrence of cooling in the lower mesosphere (~50&#x02013;70&#x02009;km), while identifying the mesopause (~80&#x02013;100&#x02009;km) as an altitude region which exhibits no significant trend, amid large uncertainties. There are three main methods of observing long-term trends in this region: <italic>in-situ</italic> rocket measurements, remote optical observations, and radio wave reflection experiments. Rocket measurements of mesospheric temperatures between ~50&#x02013;85&#x02009;km in the polar summer, using falling spheres, suggest a &#x0201c;nearly zero temperature trend&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Optical observations of mesospheric layers initially suggested a decrease in layer height over time e.g., refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, by extending the sodium lidar dataset, and taking into account seasonal variations in the height of the sodium layer, updated analysis indicates no long-term change in the vertical distribution of atmospheric sodium between 65&#x02013;110&#x02009;km, and no clear mesospheric temperature trend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A model simulation of the period 1950&#x02013;2003 using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) showed no significant long-term temperature trend near the mesopause (~80&#x02013;90&#x02009;km), although cooling trends were determined in the stratosphere below, and in the thermosphere above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A similar result was found using the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA) in a CO<sub>2</sub> doubling experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Using 20-year simulations with a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> above the then current concentrations, cooling was found everywhere above the tropopause, but with the smallest effect occurring at the mesopause.</p><p id="Par5">In contrast, there has been an observed decrease in low frequency (LF) radio wave reflection heights between 80&#x02013;90&#x02009;km[e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>]. Recent analysis of phase-height measurements of LF waves (162&#x02013;164&#x02009;kHz) made at ~50&#x02009;&#x000b0;N show a decrease in height of 114&#x02009;m per decade from 1959&#x02013;2009 at 82&#x02009;km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The measurements were made for constant solar zenith angles of 78.4&#x000b0;, i.e., during daytime conditions where the ionosphere is being strongly driven by solar EUV characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The LF long-term decreasing height trend over Europe was attributed to the CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse effect, although the influence of the quasi-11 year solar cycle in ultraviolet radiation and shorter timescale oscillations (i.e., the El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, and the quasi-biennial oscillation, QBO) were also apparent in the dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">One technique suggested for monitoring the lowest altitudes of the D-region, but not undertaken until now, is the analysis of very low frequency (VLF) radio wave propagation over very long distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The advantage of the VLF technique over many of the others comes about because of the long distance integration of the measurement compared to relatively small-scale coverage by rocket, optical cameras, and higher frequency radio wave observations. A technique has been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> of investigating the characteristics of the nighttime D-region using the timing of abrupt decreases in signal amplitude (&#x02018;fading&#x02019;) of man-made transmitter signals caused by mode conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> associated with the passage of the sunrise terminator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The timing of each amplitude fade is related to the specific location in the upper altitudes of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (60&#x02013;80&#x02009;km) where destructive interference takes place, producing a modal minima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The positions of these modal minima locations are determined by the underlying nighttime electron density profile characteristics of the D-region, typically for reflecting electron number densities of &#x0003c;300&#x02009;el/cm<sup>3</sup> (75&#x02013;85&#x02009;km at night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). The advantage of investigating long-term trends in the nighttime D-region comes from the lack of the direct influence of solar EUV on the behavior of the electron density profile, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the analysis to any anthropogenic changes. In this study we develop the amplitude &#x02018;fading&#x02019; technique, and use it to compensate for many of the instrumental/experimental factors that can make long-term comparisons so problematic.</p><p id="Par7">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows an example of the seasonal variation in the amplitude of the NAA transmitter (Cutler, Maine, USA) observed by a VLF receiver system located at Halley Station, Antarctica. The plot shows 60&#x02009;s averaged amplitude values for 2015 with fading periods easily identified by repeatable, daily, low amplitude features, represented by blue on the colour scale. Multiple sunrise fades can be seen to occur in November-December at ~08&#x02013;11&#x02009;UT. The fades are caused by the presence of modal minima at several different locations, with seasonal variations caused by the change of the time of sunrise at a given (known) location rather than a change in the location of the modal minima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, any long-term change in the characteristics of the electron density profiles of the D-region will change the location of the modal minima, and cause the time of the amplitude fade to change [e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>]. Changing times of signal fading outside of those expected from seasonal sunrise variations then acts as an absolute litmus test for changing ionospheric conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The precise timing of the amplitude fades in November-December over the last 45 years is the focus of this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The amplitude of NAA received at Halley in 2015.Amplitude fading due to the passage of the sunrise/sunset terminator along the transmitter-receiver great circle path can be seen as features with blue/black colouring.

</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Determining the time of sunrise amplitude fades</title><p id="Par8">The long-term study of the timing of man-made transmitter signals is potentially made complicated by any changes in transmitter location, frequency, power output, receiver location, logger type, amplitude calibration, and receiver timing quality. Fortunately, several of these factors are constrained by the experimental technique used in this study. Data are analysed from a VLF magnetic loop antenna system located at Halley Station, Antarctica (75&#x000b0;36&#x02032;S, 26&#x000b0;12&#x02032;W) that has been in operation since 1967, when it was installed to support the Ariel 3 and 4 satellite missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Since then, the amplitude of the NAA VLF transmitter (24.0&#x02009;kHz, Cutler, Maine, 44&#x000b0;39&#x02032;N, 67&#x000b0;17&#x02032;W) has been logged intermittently using a series of five different instruments (see Methods section for a more detailed description).</p><p id="Par9">The NAA transmitter has been transmitting with 1&#x02009;MW output power since 1961, and has changed frequency only once, from 17.8&#x02009;kHz to 24.0&#x02009;kHz in 1983. Receiver system setup, and receiver amplitude calibration uncertainties are constrained in this study by only having to identify the time at which amplitude fades occur &#x02013; the main requirement being that the signal remains above the local noise floor during the measurement. There is no requirement for the receiver system to remain well calibrated over the 45 years of this study, nor is there a requirement for the long-term output power of the transmitter to remain constant. The change in transmitted frequency from 17.8&#x02009;kHz to 24.0&#x02009;kHz in 1983 did result in a change in the location of modal minima features generated by the transmitter. However, the dimensions of the interference fringe pattern that surrounds the transmitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> are determined by the frequency used, and therefore in this study, modal minima locations and their equivalent distances from the transmitter can be expressed in terms of the equivalent 24.0&#x02009;kHz fringe pattern.</p><p id="Par10">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the great circle path (GCP) of the subionospheric radiowaves transmitted from NAA to Halley Station (green line). The amplitude of the transmitter signal at 70&#x02009;km altitude as a function of distance along the GCP is shown in red, with increased longitudinal distance from the GCP representing increased amplitude. The amplitude was calculated using the Long Wave Propagation Code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (LWPC) with D-region electron density profile characteristics specified for nighttime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Deep modal minima (which generate fading features when they interact with the terminator) can be seen as places where the amplitude line suddenly approaches the GCP. Notable locations where this happens are at the transmitter, and in the Caribbean. The location of the minima in the Caribbean would change for different transmitter frequencies (i.e., 17.8&#x02009;kHz or 24.0&#x02009;kHz). LWPC was used to investigate the fringe position between two frequencies (f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>) and a robust relationship of fringe distance, d<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;d<sub>1</sub>(f<sub>2</sub>/f<sub>1</sub>)<sup>1.12</sup> was found for a range of transmitter frequencies. An example of the position of the sunrise terminator in November as it passes overhead of the NAA transmitter is shown by the solid magenta line, with the position 65&#x02009;minutes earlier shown by the dashed magenta line. The intersection of the terminator lines with the locations of modal minima on the GCP indicate that sunrise fading should occur with a spacing of ~65&#x02009;minutes in this example.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A map of the great circle path from the NAA transmitter (red circle) to Halley Station in Antarctica (blue diamond).

Fortunately, the time at which the sunrise terminator generates an amplitude fade as it passes overhead of the transmitter is an ever-present feature in the logged data. In this study, the time of sunrise at NAA as observed in the amplitude data as a deep minimum is used to confirm that the system clocks are set accurately (to within 45&#x02009;seconds) for each year of analysis undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Changes in interference fringe patterns</title><p id="Par12">The analysis of the times of two well defined amplitude fades associated with the passage of the sunrise terminator on the NAA-Halley GCP are summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Panel (a) in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the time of the last sunrise amplitude fade on the NAA-Halley path on 28 November for years during the period 1971&#x02013;2016 where data were available. As we discuss in the methods section, sunrise times were determined for all available data from mid-November to mid-December of each year analysed. A least-squares best fit to the times was made, and the fade time for a representative day was determined, i.e., 28 November. The horizontal blue dashed line indicates the average time of the events, 10:43:30&#x02009;UT, and the blue dotted lines indicate&#x02009;&#x000b1;45&#x02009;s either side of the average. The majority of the fade times lie within the dotted lines, and are consistent with the expectation that the fade occurs as the sunrise terminator passes overhead of the transmitter. Therefore the times remain relatively unchanged throughout the study period, which is an indication that the system timing was reliable. The altitude at which sunrise occurs above the NAA transmitter at 10:43:30&#x02009;UT is 71.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, where the 1.5&#x02009;km range is equivalent to the&#x02009;&#x000b1;45&#x02009;s identified in panel (a). This altitude is consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and will be used as the altitude of sunrise along the path for the rest of this study, i.e., sunrise at 71.5&#x02009;km is important for the phenomenon studied here, not sunrise at ground level. Any long term changes in the altitude of the D-region should be observed as a systematic change in the time of the sunrise fade as the terminator passes overhead of the transmitter. However, the change in the time of sunrise over a small vertical distance range at ~70&#x02013;75&#x02009;km is an insensitive test of D-region altitude compared with the expected expansion/contraction in the fringe pattern.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The times of sunrise fades overhead of the NAA transmitter during the 45 year study period.

</p><p id="Par13">In order to compensate for the change in NAA transmission frequency from 17.8&#x02009;kHz to 24.0&#x02009;kHz in 1983, panel (b) in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> the time of the penultimate amplitude fade during sunrise has been converted to a time of sunrise at 71.5&#x02009;km for 24.0&#x02009;kHz signals. The timing measurements before 1983 typically gave 17.8&#x02009;kHz fringe distances of ~1600&#x02009;km at an altitude of 71.5&#x02009;km, and these have been scaled by the ratio of the two frequencies to give an equivalent fringe distance along the path for 24.0&#x02009;kHz. A similar calculation has been undertaken for data from 1986, where the only usable data archived during the 1980&#x02019;s was from amplitude observations of the NSS transmitter (21.4&#x02009;kHz, Annapolis, Maryland, 38&#x000b0;59&#x02032;N, 76&#x000b0;27&#x02032;W). Given the proximity in NAA and NSS transmitter locations, and the similarities in their great circle paths to Halley, the timing of the penultimate amplitude fade of NSS in 1986 was determined and the effective fringe distance from the transmitter scaled up to 24.0&#x02009;kHz from 21.4&#x02009;kHz.</p><p id="Par14">Standard deviation errors of the timing measurements of all data point shown in panel 3(b) were calculated, converted into equivalent fringe distance from the transmitter at 71.5&#x02009;km altitude, and plotted for each year plotted in the panel as a vertical black bar.

In these latter cases, the large uncertainty comes from either having few points with which to determine the fade time on 28 November, or low timing resolution of the data loggers during that year.</p><p id="Par15">A simple linear least squares fit to all data points in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref> suggests a decrease in the NAA fringe distance from ~2140&#x02009;km in 1971 to 1980&#x02009;km in 2016, or a contraction of the fringe pattern of ~3.6&#x02009;km/yr. Given the sparse data available prior to 1990, and the complicating factor of a different transmission frequency before that as well, a separate linear fit is shown using only the data from 1990 onwards. The shorter period shows a contraction of the fringe pattern by 2.6&#x02009;km/yr, which is consistent with a weaker shrinking over the last two solar cycles exhibited by LF daytime height trends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref> there is a large scatter about the best fit line, with some suggestion of an 11-year solar cycle influence because of the role of scattered Lyman-&#x003b1; and incident galactic cosmic rays on the nighttime D-region electron number density profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This is consistent with potential solar cycle changes in mesopause temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Systematic increases in fringe distance are observed during the declining phase of some solar cycles (e.g., 1992&#x02013;1995, and 2012&#x02013;2016). This solar cycle influence is investigated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c)</xref> when the data points are separated into periods with low monthly average sunspot number (0&#x02013;35), medium (36&#x02013;75) and high (&#x0003e;75) solar activity, as given by the International Space Environmental Services (ISES) sunspot number for November in each year. As there were only three data points in the high solar activity category, spanning only 7 years, those results are not shown. The red data points are associated with low solar activity, while the blue data points are from medium activity periods. Standard errors bars are the same as in panel (b). The panel suggests that there is an outward expansion of the fringe pattern with decreasing solar flux, i.e., from medium levels of sunspot activity to low levels of sunspot activity, consistent with increasing LF phase height during solar declining periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Least squares fits are shown (red line for low activity, and blue line for medium solar activity). The results show that contractions of the NAA fringe pattern of ~4.7&#x02009;km/yr occur during low solar activity periods, and ~4.4&#x02009;km/yr during medium activity periods. The contraction of a mono-chromatic fringe pattern setup between two parallel reflective surfaces (ground and the ionosphere in this case) is consistent with a reduction of the distance between the surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Typically the change in fringe pattern with the quasi-11 year solar cycle is ~100&#x02009;km, whereas the change over the whole dataset is ~200&#x02009;km. This contrasts with a LF phase height decrease of ~0.6&#x02009;km over 50 years, a solar cycle influence of ~1&#x02009;km, and shorter-term fluctuations (such as the QBO) of ~0.1&#x02009;km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The VLF transmitter fringe pattern changes studied here are too sparse to resolve fluctuations associated with the QBO, although we note that these are likely to be in the order of 10% of the solar cycle influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and are therefore ~10&#x02009;km here, i.e., within the errors bars shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The causes of inference fringe pattern contractions</title><p id="Par17">Over the last 45 years the interference fringe pattern generated by the NAA transmitter has contracted by ~4&#x02013;5&#x02009;km/yr over GCP distances of ~2000&#x02009;km, i.e., a reduction in horizontal scale size of ~10%.

Such complex interplay between temperature variations, and dynamical influences on chemical species such as NO and O<sub>2</sub> (see discussion below) could result in quite different sensitivities to climate change drivers in the daytime or nighttime D-region, as well as subtle altitudinal or latitudinal dependences.

A novel technique has been developed which is insensitive to any changes in the output power of the transmitter, compensates for the use of different data logging equipment, and can confirm the accuracy of the timing systems in operation over the 45 year study period. Corrections have been made for a change in transmitted frequency from 17.8&#x02009;kHz to 24.0&#x02009;kHz in 1978. Subionospheric radiowave propagation modeling suggests that the contraction of the interference fringe pattern about the mid-latitude transmitter is due to a 3&#x02009;km reduction in the effective height of the ionospheric D-region at about 85&#x02009;km over 45 years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par22">Data are analysed from a VLF magnetic loop antenna system located at Halley Station, Antarctica (75&#x000b0;36&#x02032;S, 26&#x000b0;12&#x02032;W) that has been in operation since 1967. Since then, the amplitude of the NAA VLF transmitter (Cutler, Maine, 44&#x000b0;39&#x02032;N, 67&#x000b0;17&#x02032;W) has been logged intermittently using a series of five different instruments. The five instruments that have logged the narrow-band transmissions from NAA are the analogue multi-channel receiver (1971&#x02013;1975), AVDAS (1981&#x02013;1990), OMSK (1992&#x02013;1999), OMNIPAL (2000&#x02013;2007), and UltraMSK (2012&#x02013;2017). The instruments have been described in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. During the 1970&#x02019;s the data were recorded on paper chart and the precise time of radio time signals noted on the paper as a tick mark. Since 1981 the data have been recorded digitally, and the timing synchronized to the Halley station clock. The digital data are simply stored as a time sequence of amplitude measurements, requiring only an identification of the time of the lowest amplitude feature during a fading event. For all years we have determined the times of amplitude fade features for all of the days in mid/late November and early December, where recordings were available. A least squares best fit to the times was made, and a time of the amplitude fade calculated for 28 November in each year. In this way data gaps where either a recording was not made, or the transmitter was off-air on the day, were compensated for. Typically up to twenty days were analysable in each year in order to identify the sunrise timings on the representative day, 28 November, and thus take into account natural ionospheric day-to-day variability. Thus in all ~800 measurements of sunrise fade times were made over the 45 years studied. Variations from the best fit to the times in each year were typically 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;minutes normally distributed about the best fit line, and the error bars shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> are the standard deviations of those residue times.</p><p id="Par23">In some years the NAA transmitter was not recorded at all, and thus no timing estimates could be made. In the 1970&#x02019;s and 1980&#x02019;s there were very sparse recordings of NAA made at any time of the year, but the period of November and December provided the most regular sampling of the transmitter, and thus we use the 28 November as the study day. During this period of the year the sunrise terminator passes overhead of the receiver before any other part of the transmitter-receiver GCP, and overhead of the transmitter last. This progression of the terminator from receiver to transmitter means that the modal minima locations are primarily determined by nighttime ionospheric conditions on the remainder of the path from transmitter to minima &#x02013; resulting in an analysis of the mid-latitude upper atmosphere over ~2000&#x02009;km between ~44&#x000b0;N and ~25&#x000b0;N (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">The timings of the amplitude fades observed in the recorded data are converted into distance along the transmitter-receiver GCP using a sunrise almanac.

Uncertainties in the distances determined through converting the calculation of the timing of sunrise were estimated as a standard error of the population of timings that were used to calculate the fade times on 28 November each year. Typically the standard deviation of the mean time of the fades in each year was 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;minutes, and the population sample size ranged from 5&#x02013;20 points, which converts to a distance along the great circle path of ~&#x02009;&#x000b1;15&#x02013;50&#x02009;km (the terminator sweeps along the Halley to NAA GCP at ~35&#x02009;km/min in November).
