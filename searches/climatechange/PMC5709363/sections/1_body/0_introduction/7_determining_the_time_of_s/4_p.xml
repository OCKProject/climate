 </sup>, the issue of accurate clock timing is critical, particularly for this type of study. Fortunately, the time at which the sunrise terminator generates an amplitude fade as it passes overhead of the transmitter is an ever-present feature in the logged data. In this study, the time of sunrise at NAA as observed in the amplitude data as a deep minimum is used to confirm that the system clocks are set accurately (to within 45â€‰seconds) for each year of analysis undertaken.
