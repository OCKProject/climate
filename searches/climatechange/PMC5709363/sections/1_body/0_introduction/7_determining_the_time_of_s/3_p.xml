 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the great circle path (GCP) of the subionospheric radiowaves transmitted from NAA to Halley Station (green line). The amplitude of the transmitter signal at 70 km altitude as a function of distance along the GCP is shown in red, with increased longitudinal distance from the GCP representing increased amplitude. The amplitude was calculated using the Long Wave Propagation Code

 </sup>. Deep modal minima (which generate fading features when they interact with the terminator) can be seen as places where the amplitude line suddenly approaches the GCP. Notable locations where this happens are at the transmitter, and in the Caribbean. The location of the minima in the Caribbean would change for different transmitter frequencies (i.e., 17.8 kHz or 24.0 kHz). LWPC was used to investigate the fringe position between two frequencies (f

An example of the position of the sunrise terminator in November as it passes overhead of the NAA transmitter is shown by the solid magenta line, with the position 65 minutes earlier shown by the dashed magenta line. The intersection of the terminator lines with the locations of modal minima on the GCP indicate that sunrise fading should occur with a spacing of ~65 minutes in this example.
