<p id="Par9" class="p">The NAA transmitter has been transmitting with 1 MW output power since 1961, and has changed frequency only once, from 17.8 kHz to 24.0 kHz in 1983. Receiver system setup, and receiver amplitude calibration uncertainties are constrained in this study by only having to identify the time at which amplitude fades occur – the main requirement being that the signal remains above the local noise floor during the measurement. There is no requirement for the receiver system to remain well calibrated over the 45 years of this study, nor is there a requirement for the long-term output power of the transmitter to remain constant. The change in transmitted frequency from 17.8 kHz to 24.0 kHz in 1983 did result in a change in the location of modal minima features generated by the transmitter. However, the dimensions of the interference fringe pattern that surrounds the transmitter

 </sup> are determined by the frequency used, and therefore in this study, modal minima locations and their equivalent distances from the transmitter can be expressed in terms of the equivalent 24.0 kHz fringe pattern.
