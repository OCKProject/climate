<p id="Par8" class="p">The long-term study of the timing of man-made transmitter signals is potentially made complicated by any changes in transmitter location, frequency, power output, receiver location, logger type, amplitude calibration, and receiver timing quality. Fortunately, several of these factors are constrained by the experimental technique used in this study. Data are analysed from a VLF magnetic loop antenna system located at Halley Station, Antarctica (75°36′S, 26°12′W) that has been in operation since 1967, when it was installed to support the Ariel 3 and 4 satellite missions

 </sup>. Since then, the amplitude of the NAA VLF transmitter (24.0 kHz, Cutler, Maine, 44°39′N, 67°17′W) has been logged intermittently using a series of five different instruments (see Methods section for a more detailed description).
