<p id="Par13" class="p">In order to compensate for the change in NAA transmission frequency from 17.8 kHz to 24.0 kHz in 1983, panel (b) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> the time of the penultimate amplitude fade during sunrise has been converted to a time of sunrise at 71.5 km for 24.0 kHz signals. The timing measurements before 1983 typically gave 17.8 kHz fringe distances of ~1600 km at an altitude of 71.5 km, and these have been scaled by the ratio of the two frequencies to give an equivalent fringe distance along the path for 24.0 kHz. A similar calculation has been undertaken for data from 1986, where the only usable data archived during the 1980’s was from amplitude observations of the NSS transmitter (21.4 kHz, Annapolis, Maryland, 38°59′N, 76°27′W). Given the proximity in NAA and NSS transmitter locations, and the similarities in their great circle paths to Halley, the timing of the penultimate amplitude fade of NSS in 1986 was determined and the effective fringe distance from the transmitter scaled up to 24.0 kHz from 21.4 kHz.
