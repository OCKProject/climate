 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(b)</xref> suggests a decrease in the NAA fringe distance from ~2140 km in 1971 to 1980 km in 2016, or a contraction of the fringe pattern of ~3.6 km/yr. Given the sparse data available prior to 1990, and the complicating factor of a different transmission frequency before that as well, a separate linear fit is shown using only the data from 1990 onwards. The shorter period shows a contraction of the fringe pattern by 2.6 km/yr, which is consistent with a weaker shrinking over the last two solar cycles exhibited by LF daytime height trends
