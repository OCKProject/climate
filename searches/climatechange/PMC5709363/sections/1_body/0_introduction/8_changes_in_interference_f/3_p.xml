<p id="Par14" class="p">Standard deviation errors of the timing measurements of all data point shown in panel 3(b) were calculated, converted into equivalent fringe distance from the transmitter at 71.5 km altitude, and plotted for each year plotted in the panel as a vertical black bar. Typically the standard error in the fringe distance is ~ ±20 km, with a few points having a range of ±50 km. In these latter cases, the large uncertainty comes from either having few points with which to determine the fade time on 28 November, or low timing resolution of the data loggers during that year.</p>
