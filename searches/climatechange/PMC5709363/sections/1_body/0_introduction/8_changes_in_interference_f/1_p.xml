 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Panel (a) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the time of the last sunrise amplitude fade on the NAA-Halley path on 28 November for years during the period 1971–2016 where data were available. As we discuss in the methods section, sunrise times were determined for all available data from mid-November to mid-December of each year analysed. A least-squares best fit to the times was made, and the fade time for a representative day was determined, i.e., 28 November. The horizontal blue dashed line indicates the average time of the events, 10:43:30 UT, and the blue dotted lines indicate ±45 s either side of the average. The majority of the fade times lie within the dotted lines, and are consistent with the expectation that the fade occurs as the sunrise terminator passes overhead of the transmitter. Therefore the times remain relatively unchanged throughout the study period, which is an indication that the system timing was reliable. The altitude at which sunrise occurs above the NAA transmitter at 10:43:30 UT is 71.5 ± 1.5 km

 </sup>, and will be used as the altitude of sunrise along the path for the rest of this study, i.e., sunrise at 71.5 km is important for the phenomenon studied here, not sunrise at ground level. Any long term changes in the altitude of the D-region should be observed as a systematic change in the time of the sunrise fade as the terminator passes overhead of the transmitter. However, the change in the time of sunrise over a small vertical distance range at ~70–75 km is an insensitive test of D-region altitude compared with the expected expansion/contraction in the fringe pattern.
