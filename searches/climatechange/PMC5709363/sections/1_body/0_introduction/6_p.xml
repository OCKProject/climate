 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows an example of the seasonal variation in the amplitude of the NAA transmitter (Cutler, Maine, USA) observed by a VLF receiver system located at Halley Station, Antarctica. The plot shows 60 s averaged amplitude values for 2015 with fading periods easily identified by repeatable, daily, low amplitude features, represented by blue on the colour scale. Multiple sunrise fades can be seen to occur in November-December at ~08–11 UT. The fades are caused by the presence of modal minima at several different locations, with seasonal variations caused by the change of the time of sunrise at a given (known) location rather than a change in the location of the modal minima

 </sup>. However, any long-term change in the characteristics of the electron density profiles of the D-region will change the location of the modal minima, and cause the time of the amplitude fade to change [e.g.

 </sup>]. Changing times of signal fading outside of those expected from seasonal sunrise variations then acts as an absolute litmus test for changing ionospheric conditions
