 <italic class="italic">β</italic> or both of these parameters can alter the waveguide propagation conditions. LWPC was used to investigate the sensitivity of the NAA nighttime fringe distance to 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>. It was found that the NAA fringe distance was relatively insensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, but a contraction of 10% could be achieved through a reduction in nighttime 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ by 3 km. Daytime reflection heights at about the same altitude (but higher electron number density) have decreased by 0.6 km over a similar period

 <italic class="italic">β</italic> is necessary to equate the two results. Near the mesopause altitudes a lack of long-term temperature cooling trend has been found

 </sup> in contrast to other latitudes, but relevant to the study here. Such complex interplay between temperature variations, and dynamical influences on chemical species such as NO and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (see discussion below) could result in quite different sensitivities to climate change drivers in the daytime or nighttime D-region, as well as subtle altitudinal or latitudinal dependences. Detailed modelling of the sensitivity of the nighttime ionosphere (in the absence of direct daytime solar EUV forcing) to anthropogenic change is required to clarify this point.
