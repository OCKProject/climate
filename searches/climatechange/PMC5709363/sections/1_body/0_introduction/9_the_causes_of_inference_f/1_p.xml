<p id="Par17" class="p">Over the last 45 years the interference fringe pattern generated by the NAA transmitter has contracted by ~4–5 km/yr over GCP distances of ~2000 km, i.e., a reduction in horizontal scale size of ~10%. Subionospheric radiowave propagation characteristics can be modeled though the use of the Long Wave Propagation Code, LWPC
