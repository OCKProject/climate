<p id="Par21" class="p">Using subionospheric radiowave observations of the NAA 24.0 kHz transmitter, Cutler, Maine, made from Halley Station, Antarctica, over the period 1971–2016, a ~10% reduction in the scale size of the transmitter nighttime interference fringe pattern has been determined. A novel technique has been developed which is insensitive to any changes in the output power of the transmitter, compensates for the use of different data logging equipment, and can confirm the accuracy of the timing systems in operation over the 45 year study period. Corrections have been made for a change in transmitted frequency from 17.8 kHz to 24.0 kHz in 1978. Subionospheric radiowave propagation modeling suggests that the contraction of the interference fringe pattern about the mid-latitude transmitter is due to a 3 km reduction in the effective height of the ionospheric D-region at about 85 km over 45 years.</p>
