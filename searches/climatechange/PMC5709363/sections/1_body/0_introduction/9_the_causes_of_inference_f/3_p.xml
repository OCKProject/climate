 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ = 82–85.6 km, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">0.4</italic>–
 <italic class="italic">0.55 </italic>km
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with an average of 0.45 ± 0.2 km
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Lightning signals were also analysed in 2005 from a similar region
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>, and estimated nighttime 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ = 82–87.2 km, but kept 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> constant at 0.65 km
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> during the height profile measurement. So, while there is no clear trend with time in the nighttime 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> values previously published, the 3 km reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′ reported here is within the ranges historically observed (~5 km). There is some suggestion of a decrease in nighttime 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> with time, where 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> varying over the range 0.65–0.45 km
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> could contribute approximately half of the observed horizontal scale contraction. There is also a suggestion to treat 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> as quasi-constant during nighttime
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> and hence the reduction in horizontal scale size of the NAA interference fringe pattern would primarily be due to the 3 km reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>′.
