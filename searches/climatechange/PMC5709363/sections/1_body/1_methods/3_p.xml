 </sup>. Uncertainties in the distances determined through converting the calculation of the timing of sunrise were estimated as a standard error of the population of timings that were used to calculate the fade times on 28 November each year. Typically the standard deviation of the mean time of the fades in each year was 1–2 minutes, and the population sample size ranged from 5–20 points, which converts to a distance along the great circle path of ~ ±15–50 km (the terminator sweeps along the Halley to NAA GCP at ~35 km/min in November). The simple linear regression best fit line in Fig.
