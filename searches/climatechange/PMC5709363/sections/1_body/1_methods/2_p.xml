<p id="Par23" class="p">In some years the NAA transmitter was not recorded at all, and thus no timing estimates could be made. In the 1970’s and 1980’s there were very sparse recordings of NAA made at any time of the year, but the period of November and December provided the most regular sampling of the transmitter, and thus we use the 28 November as the study day. During this period of the year the sunrise terminator passes overhead of the receiver before any other part of the transmitter-receiver GCP, and overhead of the transmitter last. This progression of the terminator from receiver to transmitter means that the modal minima locations are primarily determined by nighttime ionospheric conditions on the remainder of the path from transmitter to minima – resulting in an analysis of the mid-latitude upper atmosphere over ~2000 km between ~44°N and ~25°N (see Fig.
