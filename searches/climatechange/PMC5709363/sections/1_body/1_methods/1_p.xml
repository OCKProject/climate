<p id="Par22" class="p">Data are analysed from a VLF magnetic loop antenna system located at Halley Station, Antarctica (75°36′S, 26°12′W) that has been in operation since 1967. Since then, the amplitude of the NAA VLF transmitter (Cutler, Maine, 44°39′N, 67°17′W) has been logged intermittently using a series of five different instruments. The five instruments that have logged the narrow-band transmissions from NAA are the analogue multi-channel receiver (1971–1975), AVDAS (1981–1990), OMSK (1992–1999), OMNIPAL (2000–2007), and UltraMSK (2012–2017). The instruments have been described in detail

 </sup>. During the 1970’s the data were recorded on paper chart and the precise time of radio time signals noted on the paper as a tick mark. Since 1981 the data have been recorded digitally, and the timing synchronized to the Halley station clock. The digital data are simply stored as a time sequence of amplitude measurements, requiring only an identification of the time of the lowest amplitude feature during a fading event. For all years we have determined the times of amplitude fade features for all of the days in mid/late November and early December, where recordings were available. A least squares best fit to the times was made, and a time of the amplitude fade calculated for 28 November in each year. In this way data gaps where either a recording was not made, or the transmitter was off-air on the day, were compensated for. Typically up to twenty days were analysable in each year in order to identify the sunrise timings on the representative day, 28 November, and thus take into account natural ionospheric day-to-day variability. Thus in all ~800 measurements of sunrise fade times were made over the 45 years studied. Variations from the best fit to the times in each year were typically 1–2 minutes normally distributed about the best fit line, and the error bars shown in Fig.
