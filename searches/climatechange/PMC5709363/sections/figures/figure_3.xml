   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The times of sunrise fades overhead of the NAA transmitter during the 45 year study period. The 10:43:30 UT average, and 45 s either side are indicated by the blue dashed and dotted lines respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) The calculated distance of the penultimate sunrise amplitude fade from the NAA transmitter. Normally distributed standard deviation errors bars are shown as vertical lines, and a linear best fit line indicates an interference fringe pattern contraction of 3.6 km/yr over the whole dataset. A fit is also shown for just the 1990–2016 data points (blue, dashed-dot line) indicating a contraction of 2.6 km/yr. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The calculated distance of the penultimate sunrise amplitude fade from the NAA transmitter separated into periods of low (red) and medium (blue) sunspot activity levels. Interference fringe pattern contractions of 4–5 km/yr can be seen.
