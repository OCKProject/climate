  <p class="p">A map of the great circle path from the NAA transmitter (red circle) to Halley Station in Antarctica (blue diamond). A representative nighttime amplitude variation along the path of NAA is shown as a red line. Low amplitude levels occur when the line approaches the great circle path. Sunrise terminator times for 28 November are shown by magenta lines, indicating when sunrise occurs at the transmitter, and at a modal interference minima located ~2000â€‰km from the transmitter.
