  <p class="p">The amplitude of NAA received at Halley in 2015.Amplitude fading due to the passage of the sunrise/sunset terminator along the transmitter-receiver great circle path can be seen as features with blue/black colouring. During November three periods of decreased amplitude can be seen during early morning at 08–11 UT, changing in time as sunrise times change seasonally. Black horizontal stripes indicate transmitter off-times (typically 12–20 UT).</p>
