<p class="p">One of the critical needs in ramping up renewable energy strategies is the development of large-scale and inexpensive approaches for energy storage. Pumped water storage, wherein water is moved uphill when energy exists in excess and released when energy is needed, has been deployed for decades. Unfortunately, the number of sites that are suitable for this type of energy storage is limited. An analogous approach would be to store compressed air or another compressible fluid in deep sedimentary formations (Buscheck

Deep sedimentary formations are more geographically distributed than the sites suitable for pumped water storage, but there are a host of geotechnical and geochemical questions associated with how this technology might be scaled economically and sustainably.
