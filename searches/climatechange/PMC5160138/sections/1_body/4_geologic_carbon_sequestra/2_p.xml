<p class="p">In the United States, the lack of comprehensive climate legislation has made the economics of widespread deployment unfavorable. Furthermore, there also exist some real questions about the risks to groundwater, seismicity, etc., which must be quantified before investment liabilities are fully understood (Bielicki

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). From a fundamental perspective, questions related to the geochemistry of caprocks (Fitts and Peters, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and the microbiology of the aquifers overlying target repositories are of great interest (Jun

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In this special issue, the articles by Mouzakis

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) make important advances in our understanding of caprocks and their interaction with injected CO

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) presents important contributions on how CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> injection might impact microbial communities. Unconventional target formations are also of increasing interest and Cui
