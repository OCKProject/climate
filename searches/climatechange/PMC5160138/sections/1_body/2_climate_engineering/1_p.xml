<p class="p">Climate engineering, or geoengineering as it is often called, refers to any large-scale effort to engineer the climate by changing either the mass or energy balance that is contributing to global warming. Efforts to impact the mass balance might include carbon sequestration technologies, wherein CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is injected into deep geologic formations for permanent storage. Other groups have explored the potential to fertilize large swaths of the ocean to stimulate phototrophic algae growth, which would eventually die and settle at the bottom of the ocean. Other negative emission technologies could include direct air capture for storage in geologic formations, manipulation of the carbon cycle through soil management, advanced biofuels that do not contribute net fossil carbon in the course of production and combustion, and waste recapture, wherein wastewater, solids, and other materials are captured before they are released into the atmosphere. Efforts to impact the energy balance generally revolve around changing the albedo of the planet. These efforts could be as modest as painting impervious/paved surfaces white to reflect more sunlight back into space, but many also involve large-scale activities like the idea to seed clouds with particles that would reflect sunlight in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. All of these technologies could have unintended consequences, which are difficult to predict because they are impossible to experiment with at small scales. Most of the work in the geoengineering space is being led by environmental scientists, geological engineers, earth scientists, and hydrologists with experience working in the subsurface or climate scientists with the models needed to predict the impact of large-scale interventions in the atmosphere.
