<p class="p">To examine the relative focus of research on these areas, we enumerate the grants recently awarded from the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems within the Engineering Directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the number of grants (active in 2016) that pertain to the nexus of climate and each of the focus areas above. This is not a perfect metric of funding activity within environmental engineering, but many environmental engineers do receive funding from this division, and the Environmental Engineering Program is one of the single largest programs within the division.
