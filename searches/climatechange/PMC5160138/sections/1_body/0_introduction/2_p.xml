<p class="p">To engineers like us, the technological approaches for managing climate change, for example, deployment of carbon neutral energy and carbon capture and storage, may seem straightforward, but are limited primarily by overarching political and economic constraints (Bellamy, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). For this and other reasons, one research direction has been to develop technologies that will help us better 
 <italic class="italic">adapt</italic> to this brave new climate. Research and development in the broad area of climate adaptation will be an undoubtedly important area of scholarly and industrial pursuit over the coming decades. Learning to live and successfully operate societies on a planet that is a few degrees warmer will be more complex than we can fully appreciate today (Davis 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Of course, conversations about adaptation are predicated on significant and parallel efforts to decarbonize our economy to slow the underlying driver of this temperature increase. Unfortunately, our current pace of decarbonization is insufficient, making temperature increase past the end of the 21st century increasingly likely (Moss 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). At some point, adaptation ceases to be an adequate strategy.
