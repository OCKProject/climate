<p class="p">Environmental engineers are especially well positioned to become leaders in research and innovation at the CWN for at least three reasons. First, environmental engineers have extensive experience in the scientific domains needed to design technologies in this space such as water chemistry, environmental microbiology, groundwater and surface water hydrology, and atmospheric chemistry. Second, environmental engineers have a history of understanding large-scale (e.g., field scale) systems, and meaningful efforts to mitigate climate change will need to alter large-scale systems to make a difference. Third, environmental engineers have developed the skills to think about complex environments using the tools of systems engineering and the ways in which proposed technologies will interact with multiple systems (Burnham
