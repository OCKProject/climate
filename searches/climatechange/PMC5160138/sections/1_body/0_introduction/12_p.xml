<p class="p">While clearly pointing to climate change as an important area for environmental engineering, the findings of the AEESP workshops do not differentiate between climate change adaptation and mitigation. Efforts to respond to the climate change challenge through mitigation can be broadly classified into two types, (1) pollution prevention, in which new technologies are developed to replace carbon-intensive ones or (2) “geoengineering” (aka “climate engineering”), which includes efforts to change greenhouse radiative forcings by taking carbon out of the atmosphere or altering the albedo of the planet. It is worth noting here that “pollution prevention” was a term first developed several decades ago at a time when greenhouse gas emissions were not typically discussed along with more conventional air and water pollutants. However, the spirit of the term is appropriate in this context and indeed the legal definition of pollutant has expanded over the past decade to include Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs). In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts versus the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that greenhouse gases are covered by the CAAs definition of air pollutant, which is an air pollutant that endangers public health and welfare. The next year, Congress passed legislation requiring that the EPA start a program for mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases from all sectors of the U.S. economy. In 2009, the EPA Administrator signed the “Endangerment Finding,” which was that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of people. Because of this, the EPA had the legal authority to take actions about greenhouse gases under the CAA.</p>
