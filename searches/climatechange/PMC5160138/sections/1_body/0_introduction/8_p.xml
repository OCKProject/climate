<p class="p">Since its inception, the discipline of environmental engineering has had a clear mandate to advance technologies that protect human and environmental health. Environmental engineering has ties to chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, earth sciences, and public health, and its practitioners have historically applied the fundamental principles of chemistry, biology, and engineering to develop solutions to environmental problems. Environmental engineers have worked on a suite of evolving, but related, problems that have grown in scope as our understanding of environmental hazards has grown. These activities were generally tied to major environmental legislation in developed nations. In the United States, for example, the Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) all spurred major research and development efforts with far-reaching impacts. Even in the absence of major new environmental legislation, new cross-disciplinary research areas have emerged, including efforts on sustainability science, resilience, and research at the energy-water nexus. We feel that the CWN is related to, but independent of these areas in general and the energy-water nexus in particular. The scientific richness and societal importance of the CWN plays to the strengths of environmental engineering as a discipline. Other related areas of inquiry have been a high priority over the past several years. Interest in energy, water, and food has led to interesting research at the nexuses between the following:

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">• Water and health, wherein water quantity and quality stresses suggest that water reuse must become the new paradigm in increasingly water-stressed and populated regions.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">• Carbon-intensive infrastructure and climate, wherein large-scale infrastructure decisions lock us into long-term greenhouse gas emission profiles at the same time that these infrastructure systems are the most susceptible to extreme weather.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">• Agricultural systems and climate stressors, wherein the production of food, fiber, and fuel produces direct and indirect emissions, but changes in temperature profoundly alter our agricultural practices and productivity.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">• Energy and water, wherein heightened water scarcity could put the dominant means of producing thermoelectric or hydroelectric power at risk.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">• Food and water, wherein intensive agriculture practices are leading to widespread environmental degradation and changes to nutrient cycling, which pit human needs with ecosystem services.</p>
