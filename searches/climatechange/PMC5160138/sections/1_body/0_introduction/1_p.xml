 <sc class="sc">limate change is unlike any problem</sc> that environmental engineers have ever faced (Pachauri and Reisinger, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). It will have profound and far-reaching impacts on most of the economic, social, and physical infrastructure on which our societies are built (Weitzman, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Average global temperatures are projected to increase between 2°C and 6°C before 2100, and some of that warming is already being observed as we continue to break heat records (Meehl and Tebaldi, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Most of us alive today will experience some portion of that temperature increase and will observe firsthand the effects it will have on species loss, hydrologic cycles and weather, agriculture, and the built environment. Perhaps even more apparent will be the ripple effects these changes will have on social patterns such as conflict, migration, and other consequences of natural stressors (Vorosmarty, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>).
