<p class="p">The importance of the CWN was reflected in a recent series of workshops funded by the NSF and organized by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) entitled “Redefining Environmental Engineering and Science.” The workshops were designed to engage the U.S. academic community in rethinking ways the discipline can align its research and teaching agenda with emergent environmental challenges over the coming decades. The workshops were also designed to coincide with the planning for a National Research Council (NRC) initiative focused on defining the “Grand Challenges in Environmental Engineering.” That effort, which will be completed in the coming years, will be analogous to the influential National Academy of Engineering's report on “Grand Challenges in Engineering,” which helped drive strategic investments in research and development broadly. At the NSF-AEESP workshops, participants were asked to prioritize environmental challenges in terms of the level of effort and funding that should be directed toward research and compare this with current levels devoted to these challenges within their own department. Workshop participants consistently identified research on “climate change impacts and adaptation” as the highest priority for future environmental research, while also indicating that it was clearly not reflective of the current distribution of research activities within their own organizations. This suggests that research related to climate change impacts and adaptation is presently underrepresented in the environmental engineering research landscape, but that this is an area that will be of critical importance in the coming decades.</p>
