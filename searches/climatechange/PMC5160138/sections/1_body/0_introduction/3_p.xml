<p class="p">Environmental engineers have an opportunity to be leaders in developing climate mitigation technologies that will help slow the warming and heal the planet. This article presents our view on the ways in which environmental engineers might make critical contributions within what we are calling the carbon-water nexus (CWN). The CWN relates to those natural and engineered physicochemical processes that exist at the interface between greenhouse gas emissions and water cycles. Developing technologies to mitigate the impact of emissions at the CWN will be critical to develop long-term strategies for managing climate change.</p>
