<p class="p">The environmental engineering community could, for example, take a leadership role by advancing efforts to: 
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">1. Use the tools of multiphase flow in porous media and subsurface hydrology to develop large-scale energy storage in sedimentary formations.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">2. Use the tools of geochemistry to engineer accelerated weathering processes that would transform carbon into a stable carbonate, while creating valuable materials that could be used in other engineering applications.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">3. Use the tools of subsurface hydrology to engineer reservoirs such that enhanced geothermal energy resources can be deployed economically.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">4. Use the tools of water treatment to recover resources, such as nutrients and metals, to create new markets and avoid the production of virgin resources.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">5. Use the emerging tools of synthetic biology to manipulate carbon cycling in microbial communities, such as abating CH
    <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from abandoned coal and natural gas regions, as well as landfills.
   </p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">6. Use the tools of soil chemistry to develop carbon black or other novel particles that could help improve the carbon balance in soils.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">7. Use the tools of membrane separations or ion exchange resins to develop methods to generate power from salinity gradients or create novel water treatment techniques for produced water from unconventional oil and gas activities.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">8. Use the tools of life cycle assessment to explore efficiencies for producing low-carbon liquid fuels from biomass feedstocks without increasing overall water use.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">9. Use the tools of atmospheric aerosol chemistry to understand the connections between air quality, the water cycle, changing temperature, and regional climate such that we can better control the role that conventional air pollutants play on regional climates.</p>
