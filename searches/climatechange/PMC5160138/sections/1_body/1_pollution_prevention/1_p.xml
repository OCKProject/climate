<p class="p">Efforts to reduce the emissions from the transportation and electric power sectors have been led by the mechanical engineering community as they pursue efforts to harvest wind and tidal energy sources, design more energy-efficient vehicles, and improve on the efficiency of power plants. Electrical engineers and material scientists are making critical advances in batteries and photovoltaics. Civil engineers are developing new materials and methods to advance green building practices. Chemical engineers have made important innovations in biofuels and fuel cell technologies. And computer science and engineering is making dramatic advances in cyber physical systems, sensing, and optimization as it relates to a variety of infrastructure systems. Collectively, these technologies suggest that a smarter and carbon-neutral infrastructure paradigm could be adopted in the coming decades; however, given the long-design life of most infrastructure, this transition will be slow. In the meantime, existing infrastructure investments have locked us into a number of decades of legacy carbon emissions from anthropogenic sources such as power plants, cars, and manufacturing facilities.</p>
