<p class="p">Efforts to produce oil and gas from low permeability formations using hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling have resulted in a major boom in domestic hydrocarbon production (Osborn 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). These techniques rely on large volumes of fresh water, which have created a host of environmental problems (Barbot 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), some of which are explored in this study. One major concern associated with hydraulic fracturing is the leakage and seepage of fracturing fluids and methane into overlying formations (Allen 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). These processes and others will involve the flows of multiple fluids and multiple phases and the work of Zhao 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2016) begins to quantify the wettability characteristics of these systems. The work by Tao 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) describes a novel method to use carbonation reactions to cement fractures using the favorable reaction kinetics of deep formations. Bi 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reports on the use of ion-exchange resins to remove radium from produced water. Many of the components included in the fluid formulation are intended to reduce the impact of scaling on fluid flow and so the article by He 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> describes the impact of these antiscalants on barite fate in fracturing fluids. Work by Tasker 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) provides much needed experimental work on the processes influencing metal dissolution into fracturing fluids.
