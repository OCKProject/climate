<p class="p">Conventional geothermal energy for utility-scale power requires high thermal gradients that exist largely in the western United States. Geothermal resources in the rest of the country will need to rely on so-called enhanced geothermal processes, wherein a fluid is injected to stimulate the reservoir. These enhanced geothermal processes have a capacity of 13.4 million exajoules (at depths beneath 10 km in the subsurface), which is over six orders of magnitude more energy than the United States currently consumes (Blackwell

Tapping into this massive reserve economically will be a challenge, in large part, because fluid–rock interactions dominate the efficiency of these processes. There is a critical research need to better understand the physicochemical processes and the thermal transfer in target formations to develop technologies for harvesting these vast reserves.
