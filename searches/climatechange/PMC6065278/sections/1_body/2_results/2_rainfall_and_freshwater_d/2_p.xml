<p class="p">Annual freshwater discharge in each of the seven estuaries studied throughout south‐western Australia in the years between 1990 and 2015 was significantly related to annual rainfall at the weather station in the catchment of that estuary (Figure

 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). During that period, annual rainfall declined significantly at each station in the catchments of the four estuaries on the west coast (Figure

 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). These declines in rainfall parallel those for other nearby weather stations for which there were substantial but incomplete daily data, such as for Midland in the Swan River Estuary catchment. From the regression equations relating rainfall to year, the declines in rainfall between 1990 and 2015 in the catchments of the above four estuaries ranged from 21% at Perth Airport to 33% at Cape Leeuwin. While rainfall in that period declined in the catchments of the Nornalup‐Walpole, Wilson and Beaufort inlets, these declines were only 3, 4, and 18%, respectively, and not significant (Figure
