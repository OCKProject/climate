<p class="p">Pairwise likelihood‐ratio tests demonstrate that, in comparisons between each pair of the six estuaries in 2013–15, the growth curves for the females and males of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) were both typically significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; 0.01 or 0.001). This is reflected in marked variations in the durations taken by both females and males to reach their respective ages at the MLL of 250 mm (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, these time spans ranged in females from 3.6 years in Wilson Inlet to as high as 17.7 years in Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet and in males from 3.7 years to as great as 15.5 years in those same two estuaries (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
