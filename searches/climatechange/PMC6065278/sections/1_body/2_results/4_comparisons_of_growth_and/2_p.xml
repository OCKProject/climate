<p class="p">von Bertalanffy growth curves for both the females and males of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in six estuaries in 2013–15 provide a good fit to the vast majority of the lengths at age of those sexes in those systems (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The coefficients of determination were always &gt;0.80 and often 0.90 for the curves for both sexes in each estuary except for those of the Peel‐Harvey Estuary (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The lower coefficients for the curves for females and males in the latter estuary than in the other estuaries are due to the ages of the majority of fish occurring over a more restricted range (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
