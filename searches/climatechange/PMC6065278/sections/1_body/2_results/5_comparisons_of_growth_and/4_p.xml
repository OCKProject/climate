<p class="p">The body mass of both females and males of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> with lengths of 250 mm in the Moore River Estuary, Swan River Estuary, and Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet declined between 1993–96 and 2013–15 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and, in each case, the difference was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; 0.001 to 0.05). For example, a 250 mm female in the Moore River Estuary weighed, on average, 16 g less in 2013–15 than in 1993–96. In contrast, the masses of both female and male 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> of 250 mm in the Wellstead Estuary increased between 1993–96 and 2013–15 (Table
