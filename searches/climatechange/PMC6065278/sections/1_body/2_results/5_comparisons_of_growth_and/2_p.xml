<p class="p">The growth curves for both females and males of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in the Moore River Estuary, Swan River Estuary, Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet and Wellstead Estuary in 2013–15 lay below the corresponding curves for 1993–96 across the vast majority of the age range of the fish (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The slight overlap at the very lower end of the age range in these comparisons reflects differences in the estimates for
