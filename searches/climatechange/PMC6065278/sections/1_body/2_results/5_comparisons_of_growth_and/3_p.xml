<p class="p">The years required for female and male 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>, in the Moore River Estuary, Swan River Estuary, Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet and Wellstead Estuary, to reach predicted lengths equal to the MLL of 250 mm increased markedly between 1993–96 and 2013–15, thus delaying recruitment of the corresponding year classes into the fishery (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This was particularly the case in the Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet in which, on average, females would have taken almost three times as long to reach the MLL in the recent than earlier period (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Indeed, the slower growth in 2013–15 than in 1993–96 would have led to a proportionately smaller number of individuals surviving for the additional time required to attain the MLL and thus to an overall reduction in recruits into the fishery.
