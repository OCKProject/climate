<p class="p">The oxygen model predicts that, in both summer and winter, mean oxygen concentrations throughout the water column of the Moore River, Swan River and Wellstead estuaries and Nornalup‐Walpole Inlet decline as freshwater discharge decreases (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and that this occurs even though the area, water depth and biogeochemical parameters in these estuaries differ. The shallower estuaries (Moore River and Wellstead) are predicted to be more resilient to reductions in inflow rates, with mean oxygen concentrations in the deeper estuaries (Swan River and Walpole‐Nornalup) declining more markedly when inflow rates become particularly low. Furthermore, reductions in flow result in a greater rate of decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom waters than in the whole water column. This is demonstrated by the trend exhibited in the Swan River Estuary, based on weekly field measurements that were not available for the other estuaries (Supporting Information Figure
