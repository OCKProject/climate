<p class="p">The mass‐balance model was first applied using values of input parameters collated for the Swan River Estuary (see Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34236-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) and model outputs validated by comparison with dissolved oxygen concentrations recorded in that estuary in each week for the 8 years from 2008 to 2015. Because the climate, and thus hydrology of south‐western Australian estuaries, undergoes highly seasonal changes, the model for the Swan River Estuary was run separately using parameters reflecting summer (e.g., low inflows and high temperatures) and winter conditions (e.g., high inflows and low temperatures). The model was subsequently employed using values of input parameters for summer and winter conditions for the Moore River Estuary and the Walpole‐Nornalup and Beaufort inlets, the last acting as a surrogate for the nearby Wellstead Estuary for which there are no freshwater discharge data but which experiences similar rainfall (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>). As there were no long‐term monitoring data of oxygen concentration to validate the results for these three estuaries, the model is applied to each estuary using the available setup information without further calibration. Due to uncertainty in forcing conditions and model parameters, a Monte Carlo sensitivity assessment was performed for each application to provide an “envelope” of likely oxygen concentrations for each estuary over a realistic range of conditions (Supporting Information Appendix
