<p class="p">A model was developed to describe the relationship between oxygen concentration throughout the water column and freshwater discharge into an estuary. This model provides a mechanistic description of the expected relationship between declining freshwater discharge and dissolved oxygen concentrations, rather than producing precise estimates of inter‐annual variations in oxygen concentration over time. The model incorporates key processes that influence oxygen concentration, including freshwater and tidal flushing, phytoplankton production and respiration, rates of sediment oxygen demand and air‐water exchange and, in estuaries that become closed for a period, the duration of closure of their mouths. A full description of the model is provided in the Supporting Information Appendix
