<p class="p">A log‐log equation (using natural logarithms) describing the relationship between annual values for discharge in each estuary and rainfall, at the selected weather station in its catchment in the years between 1990 and 2015, was fitted and tested for significance. A linear equation was fitted to describe, for each weather station, the relationship between rainfall and the years between 1990 and 2015, while a log‐linear equation was used to describe, for each estuary, the relationship between freshwater discharge and those years. One‐tailed t tests were employed to determine whether Pearson’s correlation coefficients between annual rainfall and year at the selected stations, and between the natural logarithm of annual freshwater discharge and year in each estuary, were negative and statistically significant (
