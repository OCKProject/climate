 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018b</xref>) for the following stations (a) Gingin in the catchment of the Moore River Estuary, (b) Perth Airport in the catchment of the Swan River Estuary, (c) Dwellingup in the catchment of the Peel‐Harvey Estuary, (d) Cape Leeuwin, adjacent to the Blackwood River Estuary, (e) Vermeulen in the catchment of the Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet, (f) Albany, near Wilson Inlet, and (g) Jeramungup in the catchment of the Wellstead Estuary, near Beaufort Inlet. The weather station at each location was chosen as it yielded annual rainfall based on an entirely or largely continuous series of daily values. Annual freshwater discharges in the above estuaries, among which Beaufort Inlet acted as a surrogate for the nearby Wellstead Estuary for which there were no such data, were obtained from the Western Australian Department of Water (
