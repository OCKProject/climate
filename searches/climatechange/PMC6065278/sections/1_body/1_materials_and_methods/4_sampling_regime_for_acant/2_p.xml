Samples were obtained from several widely‐distributed sites in nearshore, shallow (&lt;2 m) waters using 21.5 and 41.5 m long seines and in deeper (2–6 m) waters, further from the shore, employing a 160 m long composite gill net. Sampling was undertaken in autumn and spring of both 2013 and 2014 and in summer of 2015. Rod and line fishing were used to catch additional
