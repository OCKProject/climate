<p class="p">A preliminary exploration of the mass‐length relationship of each sex of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in the six estuaries studied in 2013–15, and in the four of those for which there were also data for 1993–96, was undertaken. Following the approach of Froese (
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), a linear equation was fitted to the log‐transformed mass and length of ten randomly‐selected fish from each of three length categories, that is, &lt;160, 180–220, &gt;240 mm, in both autumn and spring. These two seasons were selected because data were available for 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in each estuary in those seasons in both of the above periods. The equation, which was fitted using least squares regression, was ln
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = a + 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>ln
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>, where ln is the natural logarithm, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic> are the estimated body mass (g) and total length (mm) of fish, respectively, and 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> are constants.
