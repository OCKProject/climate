<p class="p">As likelihood‐ratio tests demonstrated that the slope (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) of the log‐transformed mass‐length relationship for each sex of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in each estuary in 1993–96 often differed significantly from that of the same sex in that estuary in 2013–15, it was inappropriate to calculate a single overall mean condition factor across the full length range for comparing the body condition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in the two periods (Jennings, Kaiser, &amp; Reynolds, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Thus, comparisons of condition between periods used the mass at a given reference length of 250 mm TL, which was chosen as it represented a substantial length achieved after several years of growth in each estuary and is the MLL for 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in south‐western Australia and thus relevant to fisheries management. A reparameterized form of the mass‐length relationship, that is, ln 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = ln
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">250 mm</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>ln[
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>
 <sub class="sub">250 mm</sub>], was therefore fitted to the data for each sex in each estuary and period using the data employed in the preliminary exploration of mass‐length relationships. The estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">250 mm</sub> for each sex in each estuary in the two periods were then compared using a likelihood‐ratio test. For this, the log‐likelihood of a fitted model, which assumed that 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">250 mm</sub> was the same for an estuary in both periods, was compared with that of a model that assumed different values of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">250 mm</sub> in those two periods.
