<p class="p">This study had the following aims. (a) Describe the changes in rainfall during recent decades in the catchments of examples of the various types of estuary, including those selected for determining the biological characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in south‐western Australia, and elucidate the degree to which any such changes are reflected in volume of freshwater discharge. (b) Develop a steady‐state oxygen mass‐balance model to demonstrate that declines in freshwater discharge can negatively affect oxygen concentrations in the different types of estuaries studied. (c) Determine the growth and body condition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in six estuaries in 2013–15 to illustrate the extent to which these key biological variables vary among estuaries and whether there are indications that such variations are influenced by differences in temperature and salinity. (d) Compare biological data for 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in four of the estuaries in 2013–15 with those for the same estuaries in 1993–96, for which there are historical biological data (Sarre &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). These comparisons were used to explore the hypothesis that reductions in freshwater discharge between the two periods were accompanied in 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> by declines in growth, body condition, and length at maturity and increases in the age at maturity.
