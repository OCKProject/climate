<p class="p">South‐western Australia has experienced one of the greatest declines in rainfall of any region in Australia during the last century (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>), which has reduced runoff and thus discharge into estuaries (Petrone, Hughes, Van Niel, &amp; Silberstein, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Silberstein et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Between 1975 and 2004, the ~15% decline in rainfall in the Perth region, on the west coast of this region, was accompanied by a reduction of over 50% in the runoff into reservoirs (Bates, Hope, Ryan, Smith, &amp; Charles, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The trend map produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>) shows, however, that the extent to which rainfall has declined since 1970 becomes progressively less eastward from the lower west coast along the south coast, with changes becoming minimal in the region of the Wellstead Estuary, the most eastern of the estuaries that are the focus of this study. Still further east, rainfall even increased slightly during approximately the same period in the catchment of one estuary but did not change significantly in the catchments of two other estuaries (Hoeksema, Chuwen, Tweedley, &amp; Potter,
