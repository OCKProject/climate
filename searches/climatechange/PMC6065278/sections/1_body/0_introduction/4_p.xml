<p class="p">The characteristics of estuaries in microtidal regions make these systems particularly susceptible to accumulating nutrients and organic material and thus to the development of hypoxia (Tweedley, Warwick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Thus, in microtidal regions with Mediterranean climates, such as south‐western Australia, one of the 25 regions worldwide recognized as global biodiversity hotspots by Myers, Mittermeier, Mittermeier, Da Fonseca, and Kent (
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), the flushing effect of tides in estuaries is far less than in macrotidal systems. As rainfall in south‐western Australia occurs predominantly in winter and early spring, nutrients and organic material are mainly flushed from the estuary during that period. Consequently, any decrease in winter flushing increases the likelihood of oxygen‐depleted zones forming in the following summer when flushing is least and temperatures are greatest and conditions for microbial utilization of nutrients and organic material are thus optimal (Cottingham, Hall, &amp; Potter,
