<p class="p">On the basis of data collected in 1995–2010, the extent of hypoxia in the bottom waters of the Swan River Estuary on the lower west coast of Australia is inversely related to freshwater discharge, which declined during those years (Cottingham, Hesp, Hall, Hipsey, &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The degree to which the Swan River Estuary has become degraded is emphasized by the conclusion of Cloern, Foster, and Kleckner (
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) that it was the second most eutrophic of the 131 estuarine‐coastal ecosystems from around the world for which they had collated data. Although oxygen concentrations in bottom waters of south‐western Australian estuaries have been continuously monitored only in the Swan River Estuary, the limited data available for the Moore River and Blackwood River estuaries indicate that the prevalence of hypoxia in the bottom waters of these systems has likewise increased following declines in flow (Anderson,
