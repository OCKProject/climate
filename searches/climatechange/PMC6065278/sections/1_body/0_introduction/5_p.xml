<p class="p">The possession by the estuaries of south‐western Australia of typically a narrow entrance channel (lower estuary) that leads to a wide central basin area (middle estuary) results in attenuation of the already relatively weak tidal action (Spencer, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1956</xref>). This, in turn, means that tidal influence is particularly small in the saline lower reaches of the rivers (upper estuary) that discharge into the basins. It thus follows that the flushing of south‐western Australian estuaries, and of microtidal estuaries elsewhere, is largely governed by freshwater discharge. Furthermore, the extent to which the estuaries of south‐western Australia are connected with the sea varies, which will clearly affect the extent to which these systems are flushed. Thus, although a number of estuaries in this region remain permanently open, for example, the Swan River Estuary and Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet, sand bars form at the mouths of many others. Such bars close the estuary from the ocean either intermittently during the year, for example, Moore River Estuary, seasonally, for example, Wilson Inlet, or for a number of years, for example, Wellstead Estuary, which is therefore termed a normally‐closed estuary (Hodgkin &amp; Hesp,
