<p class="p">The increase in the extent of bottom water hypoxia in the Swan River Estuary since the 1990s was accompanied in the demersal Black Bream 
 <italic class="italic">Acanthopagrus butcheri</italic> by reductions in growth and body condition and a strong tendency for aggregating in shallow, better‐oxygenated areas, which led to a marked increase in density in those waters (Cottingham, Hall, Hesp, &amp; Potter,

 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In the Swan River Estuary, the increased prevalence of hypoxia was also accompanied by a decrease in length at maturity and increase in age at maturity of

 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). The changes in the biological characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in the Swan River Estuary with marked reductions in oxygen concentrations occurred either directly through effects on metabolism or indirectly through, for example, density‐dependent mechanisms or changes in prey composition (Cottingham et al.,
