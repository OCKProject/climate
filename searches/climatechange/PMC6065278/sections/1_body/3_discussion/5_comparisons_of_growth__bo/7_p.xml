<p class="p">The increase in age at maturity that typically occurred as growth declined implies that 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> now requires a greater period to attain the threshold length necessary for maturation, which is consistent with changes predicted by life‐history theory (e.g., Plaistow, Lapsley, Beckerman, &amp; Benton, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Stearns &amp; Koella, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>) and exhibited in wild populations, such as of the Chum Salmon 
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus keta</italic> in northern Japan (Morita &amp; Fukuwaka, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In contrast to life‐history theory, the length at maturity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> declined in only one of the four estuaries. As growth in the other three estuaries was not as great as in that estuary, it is proposed that the individuals in those estuaries require longer to attain a threshold size for becoming mature and thus, through further growth prior to maturity at the commencement of the following or later spawning season(s), lengths at maturity have become greater.
