<p class="p">The decline that occurred in the growth and typically body condition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in estuaries between 1993–96 and 2013–15, as discharge decreased and the extent of hypoxia is thus presumed to have increased, is consistent with the reductions in the values recorded for those biological characteristics in fishes in the northern hemisphere when exposed to hypoxia (e.g., Pichavant et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Wu, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In the Neuse River Estuary, the growth and body condition of the Atlantic Croaker 
 <italic class="italic">Micropogonias undulates</italic> was least in years when hypoxia was greatest (Eby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), a trend consistent with the results of subsequent laboratory experiments (Mohan, Rahman, Thomas, &amp; Walther, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Furthermore, hypoxic events, such as those that occur in the Neuse River Estuary and Swan River Estuary, have been shown to have deleterious effects on the prey resources of demersal fish (Powers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Tweedley, Hallett, Warwick, Clarke, &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Thus, for example, following hypoxic events, the abundance of the clam 
 <italic class="italic">Macoma balthica</italic> declined by 90% in the Neuse River Estuary and molluscs and crustaceans virtually disappeared in the Swan River Estuary (Powers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Tweedley, Hallett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, the decline in environmental quality in different south‐western Australian estuaries has been accompanied by the same directional changes in taxonomic distinctness of benthic macroinvertebrates (Tweedley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), key prey of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in this region (Chuwen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Sarre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>).
