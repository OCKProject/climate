<p class="p">This study has confirmed the hypothesis that reductions in freshwater discharge, and thus presumably increases in the extent of hypoxia in the Moore River, Swan River and Wellstead estuaries and Nornalup‐Walpole Inlet between 1993–96 and 2013–15, were accompanied by declines in the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>. The decline in growth was reflected in an increase in the average duration taken by fish to attain a length of 250 mm, with increases by females of ~2 times in the Moore River, Wellstead and Swan River estuaries and as high as ~3 times in the Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet. Since the time taken by males to reach 250 mm in each estuary also increased markedly, and to a similar degree, the same trends were exhibited by both sexes. The decline that consistently occurred in the growth of females and males in each of the above four estuaries between 1993–96 and 2013–15 implies that, throughout the large region of south‐western Australia, this species was responding to factor(s) that were operating in a common direction.
