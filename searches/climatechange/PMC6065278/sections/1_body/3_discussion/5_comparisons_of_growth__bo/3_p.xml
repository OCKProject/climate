<p class="p">The declines in the growth of both sexes of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in Moore River Estuary, Swan River Estuary and Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet between 1993–96 and 2013–15 were accompanied by reductions in body condition in all estuaries except Wellstead Estuary. Furthermore, when using data for each sex in both periods in the above four estuaries (except for those for Wellstead Estuary in 1993–96) and those for the Peel‐Harvey Estuary and Wilson Inlet in 2013–15, the mass and age at 250 mm were closely related. This implies that typically the factor(s) regulating the growth and body condition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> are closely linked and that any tendency for body condition to decline will be accompanied by a reduction in energy reserves that could be used for growth (Lambert &amp; Dutil,
