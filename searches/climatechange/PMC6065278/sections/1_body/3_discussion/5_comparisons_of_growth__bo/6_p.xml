<p class="p">As the marked variations in the growth and body condition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> across a wide range of estuaries in the same time period, 2013–15, were not conspicuously related to temperature and salinity, it appears unlikely that the significant changes in growth and body condition, which occurred between 1993–96 and 2013–15 in the four estuaries for which there were historical biological data, were closely related to the extent of the changes in these variables between the two periods. For example, in the Swan River Estuary, the annual mean for monthly maximum air temperatures, derived from continuous daily measurements at Perth Airport in the vicinity of the upper region of that estuary, in which 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> spends the majority of its life, increased, on average of only ~1.8°C between 1990 and 2015 (Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, the corresponding increase in water temperature between these periods, for which there are no directly comparable data, would be expected to be even less. On the basis of the regression equation relating salinity to year and derived from weekly measurements between 1995 and 2015, the salinity at a site in the Swan River Estuary, increased, on average, by 5.8 at the surface and 8.3 at the bottom of the water column (Water Information, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), with surface and bottom salinities at all times well within the range in which 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is known to grow well (Partridge &amp; Jenkins,
