<p class="p">This study emphasizes that the management of the different types of estuaries in south‐western Australia needs to take into account that declining rainfall has been accompanied by large reductions in freshwater discharge into those systems, a trend which, in populated and agricultural areas, would have been exacerbated by anthropogenic influences such as abstraction. The results and modelling imply that consequent reductions in flushing have led to increased accumulations of nutrients and organic material and thus in the extent of hypoxia, thereby leading to detrimental changes to the biological characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>. Every attempt should thus be made to maintain current discharge levels and, where possible, reduce the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities on flow within the estuary. From a fisheries management perspective, the reduced growth and changes in maturity schedules of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> will probably have reduced recruitment to the fishery and/or spawning biomasses of the populations in the different south‐western Australian estuaries and thus the amenity to fishers of this important recreational fish species in those estuaries. These detrimental biological effects will presumably worsen as a result of the effects of continuing climatic changes (Barron et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). It thus follows that ongoing assessment of the biological characteristics of highly adaptable species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>, would provide an excellent additional method for monitoring and assessing the “health” of estuaries.
