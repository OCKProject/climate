<p class="p">It was striking that, in each of the six estuaries studied in 2013–15, the age and mass of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> at the MLL of 250 mm, regarded as a reflection of growth and body condition, respectively, did not follow that of the latitudinal sequence of these estuaries (cf. Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34236-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and

 <xref rid="ece34236-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, for example, growth and body condition were greatest in Wilson Inlet at 34.99°S on the south coast and Peel‐Harvey Estuary at 32.62°S on the west coast and least in the Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet at 35.00°S on the south coast and Moore River Estuary at 31.37°S on the west coast. Although water temperatures in each of these estuaries have not been recorded continuously, such data are available for air temperatures in their regions, whose trends will essentially parallel those of water temperature. The monthly mean maximum air temperatures for the region between the intermittently‐open Moore River Estuary and permanently‐open Peel‐Harvey Estuary at 31.37°S to 32.62°S are greater in each month than in the region between the permanently‐open Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet and normally‐closed Wellstead Estuary at 35.00°S to 34.39°S, with respective ranges of 19–31°C for the west coast and 16–23°C for the south coast (Australian Bureau of Meteorology,

 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in south‐western Australian estuaries are strongly correlated, variations in each of these two biotic variables among estuaries are not conspicuously related to temperature or estuary type.
