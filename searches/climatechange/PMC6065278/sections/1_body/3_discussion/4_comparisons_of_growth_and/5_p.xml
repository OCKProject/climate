<p class="p">Although there were data that enabled us to propose that differences in the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A.Â butcheri</italic> among estuaries were not strongly related to either water temperature (with air temperature as a surrogate) or salinity, there are no data to facilitate comparisons of the oxygen regimes across those estuaries. When available, oxygen concentration in those estuaries was based on measurements taken on a single day during sampling and often at seasonal intervals and thus do not provide a reliable basis for comparing oxygen concentrations among those estuaries.
