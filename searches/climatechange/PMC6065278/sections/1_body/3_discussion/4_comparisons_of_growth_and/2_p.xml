<p class="p">The biological data derived for 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in 2013–15 in six estuaries, representing a range of estuarine types and environments, demonstrate that, during the same time period, the growth and body condition of this sparid varied greatly among these systems. With respect to growth, it is particularly relevant that the growth rates of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>, cultured separately from broodstock from the Swan River and Moore River estuaries in December 1999, were essentially identical, whereas the growth of the wild stock was far greater in the former estuary (Partridge et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). This provides strong circumstantial evidence that the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is related more to the environmental characteristics of an estuary than to the small differences that exist between the genetic compositions of this sparid in different estuaries (Chaplin, Baudains, Gill, McCulloch, &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Partridge et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). As 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is a highly opportunistic “feeder” (Sarre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), it is thus relevant that this species fed mainly on bivalve molluscs in the Swan River Estuary, compared with large volumes of the macroalgae 
 <italic class="italic">Cladophora</italic> sp. in the Moore River Estuary, presumably reflecting differences in the relative abundances of the food sources in those estuaries (Chuwen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Sarre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). As the main dietary components of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> are of less nutritional value in the Moore than Swan River Estuary, it was proposed that the differences in dietary composition are considered likely to have contributed to the differences between the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in these two systems (Sarre &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Major differences in the dietary composition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> in a range of estuaries (Chuwen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Sarre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) could thus account for the variations exhibited by the growth of this sparid among estuaries (Chuwen, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Sarre &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; present study). These differences demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is highly opportunistic in its “choice” of food. As the density of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> was greater in the Moore than Swan River Estuary, a density‐dependent effect may also have contributed to the differences between the growth of this sparid in these two systems (Partridge et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Sarre &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>).
