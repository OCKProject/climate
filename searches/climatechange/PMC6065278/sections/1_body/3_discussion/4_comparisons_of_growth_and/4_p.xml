<p class="p">The present and other studies demonstrate that, in south‐western Australia, 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is abundant and can grow in different types of systems and in salinities ranging from close to zero to in excess of that of full strength seawater (e.g., Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Sarre &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Young &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Young, Potter, &amp; de Lestang, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Furthermore, in laboratory trials, this species survived well and grew in salinities ranging from 0 to 48 (Partridge &amp; Jenkins, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The above comparisons emphasize that 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> is highly euryhaline. Although 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> moves within estuaries and thus encounters a range of salinities, there are no clear indications that the variations in growth among estuaries consistently follow the trends exhibited by the broad salinity regimes in these systems. It is thus concluded that differences in temperature and salinity among estuaries are not primarily responsible for the large variations in the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> among estuaries in south‐western Australia. However, at a far larger spatial scale, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic> was shown to be negatively correlated with temperature in estuaries in the relatively cool climate of Tasmania over a 21 year period and positively correlated with temperature (and also rainfall) in an estuary in South Australia over a 13 year period (Doubleday et al.,
