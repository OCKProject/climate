 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) confirm that annual discharges into different types of estuaries in south‐western Australia were positively correlated with annual rainfall in their catchments in the years between 1990 and 2015. These estuaries included those for which the biological characteristics of

Discharge has also been found to be positively correlated with rainfall in Stokes Inlet, which is located 170 km to the east of the most eastern system (Wellstead Estuary) considered in the present study (Hoeksema et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The inflows into the 11 major dams in the Perth region in the years from 1911 to 1976 and 1977 to 2013 have previously been shown to be positively correlated with rainfall throughout south‐western Australia (Smith &amp; Power,
