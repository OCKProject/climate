<p class="p">The percentage declines of 62%–89% in annual freshwater discharge in the four west coast estuaries in 1990–2015 greatly exceed those of annual rainfall in the corresponding catchments of those estuaries (see above). The far greater proportional declines in freshwater discharge are in line with estimates that a decline in rainfall of 15%–20% was accompanied by a reduction of up to 70% in runoff into reservoirs in the region of the Swan River Estuary (Bates et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although a decline in rainwater input via streams and tributaries is the main contributor to declines in freshwater discharge, a reduction in rainfall has also reduced groundwater levels and thus the “reservoir” of supplementary water that contributes to discharge (Smettem, Waring, Callow, Wilson, &amp; Mu, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Furthermore, declines in freshwater discharge have almost certainly been exacerbated by factors, such as the diversion of water for agriculture, industry and human use (McFarlane et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). In south‐western Australia, these effects would have been most pronounced in the regions of the Peel‐Harvey and Swan River estuaries, which are well‐populated and extensively developed for agriculture (McFarlane et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The progressive downward trend in groundwater levels of the Gnangara Mound in the catchment of the Swan River Estuary between 1997 and 2017 reflects a combination of the effects of declining rainfall and increasing water abstraction (
