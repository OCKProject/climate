<p class="p">The finding that, on the south coast, the declines in annual rainfall on the Frankland River, which discharges into the Walpole‐Nornalup Inlet, and at Albany near Wilson Inlet were not statistically significant is broadly consistent with Albany lying in a region where, between 1970 and 2017, rainfall declined only slightly (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>). The highly significant relationships between discharges in the rivers entering both the Walpole‐Nornalup and Wilson inlets and year emphasize that a small and statistically insignificant proportional change in average annual rainfall in the catchment of an estuary can lead to a large and statistically significant proportional change in average freshwater discharge.
