<p class="p">The magnitude of the declines in annual rainfall recorded between 1990 and 2015 at weather stations in the catchments of the four west coast estuaries and three south coast estuaries are consistent with those “modelled” for that region between 1970 and 2018 (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>). Thus, the percentage declines of 21%–33% in annual rainfall between 1990 and 2015 in the catchments of the four west coast estuaries were typically far greater than the reductions of 3%, 4% and 18% in the catchments of the three south coast estuaries, with the former declines statistically significant.
