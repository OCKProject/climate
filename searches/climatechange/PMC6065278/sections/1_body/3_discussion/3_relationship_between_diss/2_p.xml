<p class="p">It was previously established that the spatial extent of hypoxia in the Swan River Estuary increased significantly between 1995 and 2010 as freshwater discharge declined (Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although the other estuaries in this study do not possess the same spatio‐temporal pattern of hydrologic dynamics, the oxygen‐balance model still indicates that a reduction in freshwater discharge likewise leads to an increase in retention time and influence of sediment oxygen demand on oxygen concentration in those estuaries and particularly in summer.
