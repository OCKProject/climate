<p class="p">The model, which describes the relationship between oxygen concentrations throughout the water column and flow, predicts that, as a result of a reduction in average inflow rates, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the different types of estuary studied would have declined between 1990 and 2015. This implies that each estuary has been impacted, to some extent, by the reduction in freshwater discharge that occurred during this period. Confirmation of this conclusion requires, however, the acquisition of comprehensive environmental data for those estuaries for which such data are not available.</p>
