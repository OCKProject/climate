<p class="p">Although the magnitudes of predicted reductions in mean oxygen concentrations throughout the water column are modest, the model’s predictions are conservative in that they do not assume periodic stratification (which would occasionally enhance the oxygen drawdown) and, more importantly, do not take into account the localized areas of low oxygen that will develop during warm conditions and low wind. Furthermore, the declining summer base‐flow in key rivers of south‐western Australia is leading to longer periods of very low flow (Smettem et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This will increase the extent and duration of hypoxic events in the bottom waters of the upper estuarine reaches, expanding the low oxygen tail on the oxygen probability distribution (i.e., frequency of events below 4 mg/L). In addition, low flow rates in winter lead to a greater accumulation of organic‐rich sediments and thus to an increase in hypoxia in deeper waters, particularly in summer (Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which is not taken into account by the model. Such accumulations are particularly relevant for demersal species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">A. butcheri</italic>, whose larger individuals live in deeper waters when conditions are favorable, but occupy shallow waters when those deeper waters become hypoxic, thus leading to increases in density (Cottingham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34236-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Oxygen concentrations would be less likely to decline markedly in shallow than deeper waters as their oxygen content is overwhelmingly influenced by oxygen air‐water exchange rather than by freshwater discharge. Furthermore, shallow waters are less prone to stratification.
