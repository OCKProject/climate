However, agriculture is highly heterogeneous across the country owing to regional disparities in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It is essential to know and quantify the possible impacts of changes in climate on crop yield for successful agricultural management and planning at a local scale. The Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM-ES) was employed to generate regional climate projections for the study area using the Regional Climate Model (RCM) RegCM4.4. The dynamics in potential impacts at the sub-district level were evaluated using the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCPs). The aim of this study was to simulate the crop yield under a plausible change in climate for the coastal areas of South India through the end of this century. The crop simulation model, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 4.5, was used to understand the plausible impacts on the major crop yields of rice, groundnuts, and sugarcane under the RCP 4.5 trajectory. The findings reveal that under the RCP 4.5 scenario there will be decreases in the major C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> crop yields in the study area. This would affect not only the local food security, but the livelihood security as well. This necessitates timely planning to achieve sustainable crop productivity and livelihood security. On the other hand, this situation warrants appropriate adaptations and policy intervention at the sub-district level for achieving sustainable crop productivity in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.

The increasing challenge of food and livelihood insecurity largely depend on the rate of yield gain of the major cereal crops in a country like India [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Global warming due to a rise in greenhouse gases may exacerbate the negative consequences on crop productivity and food security [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global (land and ocean) average temperature has risen 0.85&#x000b0;C (0.65&#x02013;1.06&#x000b0;C) over the period of 1800&#x02013;2012 [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This trend in global warming is predicted to increase during the 21st century under all the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The projected ranges of temperature increase are 0.3&#x02013;1.7&#x000b0;C (RCP 2.6), 1.1&#x02013;2.6&#x000b0;C (RCP 4.5), 1.4&#x02013;3.1&#x000b0;C (RCP 6.0), and 2.6&#x02013;4.8&#x000b0;C (RCP 8.5) for the years 2081&#x02013;2100, relative to 1986&#x02013;2005 [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such changes in global mean temperature can radically disturb human society and the natural environment [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, the changes in extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, severe winters, summer storms, hot and cold days, and hot and cold nights, may severely impact the agricultural ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite all technological and cultivar advancements, the weather and the climate are continuing to be the uncontrollable factors affecting crop yield. The yield of crops, particularly in rainfed conditions, depends on the climate to an even larger extent [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Research on agriculture in the developing nations has focused on the need to have increased cereal production [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Though agriculture in India has undergone major structural changes, it is still the mainstay of the economy with about 49% of the labor force depending on agriculture and the allied sectors for their livelihoods. Agriculture supports the vast majority of the low income, the poor, and the vulnerable people in the country; and climate plays a crucial role, as about 55&#x02013;60% of the area sown is still rainfed. The share of agriculture and allied activities in the Indian gross domestic product (GDP) was 13.7% during 2012&#x02013;13 [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There are numerous direct and indirect impacts reported on crop production due to the overall impacts of climatic attenuations. The yield of crops, particularly in rainfed conditions, depends on the climate to a larger extent. Global warming may adversely affect the biodiversity and exacerbate the desertification due to an increase in evapotranspiration and a likely decrease in rainfall in dry lands (although it may increase globally) [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The direct impacts will have implications for the morphology, the physiology, and the phenology of a plant. Increased temperatures will have profound effects on crop development. Higher temperature exposure beyond the threshold level will eventually affect the quality and the quantity of yields of desirable crops, while weeds infest the areas and pests proliferate [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The impacts depend on the relative warming at different growth stages: seed germination, seedling emergence, leaf production, leaf expansion, leaf area duration, flower initiation, flower development, pollination, ripening, maturity, vernalization, and dormancy. Varying precipitation patterns augment the likelihood of short-run crop failures and long-run production declines [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The strong negative impacts of warming that limit plant growth, metabolism, and productivity worldwide have been reported by various researchers [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Indian agricultural production and, consequently, the country&#x02019;s gross domestic product (GDP) show a strong link with the Indian summer monsoon rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In order to meet the food requirement for the ever increasing population of India, the rice production has to be increased to 162 MT by the year 2015, to 171 MT by 2020, to 178 MT by 2025, and to 185 MT by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, many scientific articles have highlighted the need for studying the impacts of changing temperatures on the yields of major crops. Kumar and Jain [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggested that higher temperatures reduce the yields regardless of rainfall, as noted consistently by other researchers. India falls prey to both these conditions, exacerbated by the fast rate of population growth and the need to feed a billion people. India, with a vast stretch of coastline, is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world regarding the likely impacts of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There is projected to be a threefold expansion of the density of the population in the coastal areas, and 50% of the world&#x02019;s population will occupy the area within 100 km of the coastal areas [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this context, acquiring an in depth knowledge of the intricate relationship between climate and crop performance is imperative [<xref rid="pone.0180706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Increased temperatures will have profound effects on crop development.

There are unique names locally for each season and for crops like Kharif and Rabi in the Indian crop production scenario. The main seasons in the study area were the Sambha, which is dependent on the northeast monsoon (i.e., the post monsoon rainfall) and the Kuruvai cultivation, which relies on the southwest monsoon showers. The rice crop calendar starts with Sambha (Aug-November), and is followed by Navarai (Dec-Jan) and Sornavari (April to July), which are purely dependent on the tube well and the tank irrigation. The major rice varieties grown in each of these seasons are ADT 37, 47, Mdu-5, and ADT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-45. They are also known as Sornavari and Navarai, as they are short duration varieties. These main varieties take 105 to 110 days for maturity. In contrast, during Sambha, medium- and long-duration varieties are grown, including IWP, ADT44, ADT-43, CR1009, ADT38, TRY1, 2. These have a 135&#x02013;150 day maturity time.</p><p>With respect to the groundnut crop production, the major cultivating season is found to be the winter, locally known as Margazhi Pattam (December-January). The main varieties grown during this time are TMV 7, VRI-2, ALR3, and CO(gn).

The DSSAT crop simulation model is a very constructive tool for making important decisions for future agricultural operations. Major negative impacts with respect to changes in climate and crop yield are noticed for the rice crop, which is a major food crop in India. A more detailed study using a high resolution climate model at the village level would provide promising outcomes for micro-level adaptation assessments. Furthermore, this study has revealed that without timely adaptation, the food security and livelihood security would be at it risk using the climate change scenarios as described in RCP4.5. It is necessary to have a synergistic adaptation assessment and implementation plan that combines field level and scientific inputs (community based adaptations), but that also enhances the inherent capacity of the crops (ecosystem based adaptations) to withstand any future changes in climate. This study has also provided a systematic approach to explicitly identify vulnerable areas with respect to diminishing crop yields, where regional planners and policy makers can build on existing adaptation decision-making by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach in the context of global change scenarios.</p><p>The results of the impact assessment show the areas that may require extra focus in crop production in the semiarid agro-ecological zones of South India. Micro-level analysis with high resolution climate details would be highly beneficial for better adaptation at the village level. These areas exhibit the highest degree of negative variation in crop yield, with conditions of high vulnerability expected in the later part of the 21st century.
