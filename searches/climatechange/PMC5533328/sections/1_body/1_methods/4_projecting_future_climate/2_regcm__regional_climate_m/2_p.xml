<p class="p">The RCP 4.5, which is said to be in good coherence with the climate of the Indian subcontinent, was chosen for simulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This representative concentration pathway was chosen as it approximates the observed climatic conditions of an Indian scenario and that of the previous IPCC SRES A1B scenario. The period of study chosen was from 1971–2098 (128 years), considering 1970–2000 as the baseline, 2010–2040 as Near Century, 2041–2070 as Mid Century, and 2071–2098 as End Century. The 14 grid points covering the entire study area were extracted for analysis purposes.
