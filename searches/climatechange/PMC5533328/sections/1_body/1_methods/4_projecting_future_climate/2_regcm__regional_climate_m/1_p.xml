<p class="p">This study employed the dynamical downscaling approaches using the Regional Climate Model-RegCM 4.4 rc22 with HadGEM 2-ES lateral boundary conditions. The Regional Climate Model Version 4.4 (RegCM4.4) being developed by Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Italy, to simulate the future climate. It is an earth system model. For simulating the plausible future climate, the latest available emission trajectory (RCP 4.5) proposed by the AR5 report of IPCC was used (
