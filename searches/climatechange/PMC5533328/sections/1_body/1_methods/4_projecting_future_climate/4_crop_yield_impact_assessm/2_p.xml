<p class="p">The CERES-Rice Plant Growth Module is process based and comes under the Grain Cereals-Rice compartment inside the DSSAT. This model emphasizes the effects of the weather, the management, and the soil properties on the crop performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The model was designed to predict the yield of crop varieties, the soil water regimes, and the nitrogen (N) level, considering alternative technologies and new crop sites as well [

 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Timsina and Humphreys [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] validated the output and mentioned that the CERES-Rice model has performed reasonably well in Asia and Australia. The performance of this model was evaluated using simulated and observed crop yield values at TNAU by various researchers.
