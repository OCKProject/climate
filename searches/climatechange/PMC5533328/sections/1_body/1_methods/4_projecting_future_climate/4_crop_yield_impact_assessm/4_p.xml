<p class="p">The CANEGRO Plant Growth Module has been used widely to simulate the crop yield under changing climate and management conditions. This module is in the 'Sugar/Energy Cropsâ€”Sugarcane' compartment in the DSSAT model. The CANEGRO model developed by Inman-Bamber [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] could be a suitable tool to assist with this complex task of yield predictions. The CANEGRO model simulates the response of various sugar cane varieties under various agro-climatic conditions. It simulates the processes of water movement, such as runoff, gravitational flow, and root water uptake in a multi-layered soil profile. It also simulates canopy development, which is used to drive the energy balance of the crop by intercepting radiation for photosynthesis. Biomass is dynamically distributed among different components of the plant, including sucrose accumulated in the stalk, which is based on crop age, level of water stress, and temperature.
