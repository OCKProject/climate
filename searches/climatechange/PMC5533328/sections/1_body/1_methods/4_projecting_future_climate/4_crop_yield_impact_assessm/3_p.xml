<p class="p">The CROPGRO plant growth module is used widely to simulate the yields of legumes, including soybeans, peanuts, dry beans, chickpeas, cowpeas, velvet beans, and faba beans; vegetables, including tomatoes, bell peppers, cabbage, and green beans; forages, such as Bahia and brachiaria; and fiber crops like cotton. The effects of climate factors on the growth and the development of groundnuts have been simulated by the CROPGRO-peanuts in this study. It can be used to determine the impacts and adaptation of groundnuts to future climate change [
