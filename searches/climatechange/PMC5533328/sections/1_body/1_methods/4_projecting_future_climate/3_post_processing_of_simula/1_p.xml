<p class="p">The 14 grid points covering the entire study area were extracted for analysis purposes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180706.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The Arc GIS 10.2 was utilized to cull out the data pertaining to the study region. The simulation data of 88 years pertaining to Near Century (2010–2040), Mid Century (2041–2070), and End Century (2071–2098) climate scenarios, and the 30 year base line period (1970–2000) were analyzed. The major weather variables, including the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, the solar radiation, and the rainfall, were extracted from the outputs of the Regional Climate Models (RCMs). Since the HadGEM2 boundaries had a 360 day calendar, this was converted to the Gregorian calendar using methodology suggested by Minguez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. From the daily outputs of Reg CM4.4, mean changes for the 30 year period and decadal estimations were made using the statistical software, SPSS.
