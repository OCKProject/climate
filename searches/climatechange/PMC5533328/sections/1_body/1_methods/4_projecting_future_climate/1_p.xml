The downscaled output has been collected from the Agro Climate Research Center, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore (TNAU), India. Fine resolution (25 km) climate data that are downscaled using the regional climate model, RegCM-Had Gem2-ES, were employed in this research. Studies based on the latest emission trajectories (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)) are very limited on impact assessment, especially for the Indian scenarios, which are in the infancy stage.
