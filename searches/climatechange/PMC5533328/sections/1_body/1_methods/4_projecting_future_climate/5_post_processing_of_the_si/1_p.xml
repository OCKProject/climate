<p class="p">The simulated outputs from the model was analyzed statistically and plotted using the Arc GIS tool. The daily values of the simulated outputs were converted into monthly values and then aggregated into 30 year mean periods starting from the baseline 1971–2000, and continuing through Near Century (2010–2040), Mid Century (2041–2070), and End Century (2071–2098). A spatial analysis was performed using the Arc GIS software on the relative yield changes of the major crops over the study area.</p>
