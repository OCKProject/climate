<p class="p">To achieve the target of 4% agricultural growth as envisaged in the Government of India's XI Five Year Plan Period (2007–2012), the enhancement of agriculture productivity is a focus. Indian agricultural production and, consequently, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) show a strong link with the Indian summer monsoon rainfall [

 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] suggested that higher temperatures reduce the yields regardless of rainfall, as noted consistently by other researchers. India falls prey to both these conditions, exacerbated by the fast rate of population growth and the need to feed a billion people. India, with a vast stretch of coastline, is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world regarding the likely impacts of climate change [
