 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. According to the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global (land and ocean) average temperature has risen 0.85°C (0.65–1.06°C) over the period of 1800–2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This trend in global warming is predicted to increase during the 21st century under all the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The projected ranges of temperature increase are 0.3–1.7°C (RCP 2.6), 1.1–2.6°C (RCP 4.5), 1.4–3.1°C (RCP 6.0), and 2.6–4.8°C (RCP 8.5) for the years 2081–2100, relative to 1986–2005 [

 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; however, the changes in extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, severe winters, summer storms, hot and cold days, and hot and cold nights, may severely impact the agricultural ecosystems [
