<p class="p">In this study, under the enhanced emission pathway under RCP 4.5, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (+520 ppm) effect was seen until the Mid Century period, as there were some peaks in crop yield. After that threshold level, the yield of rice and groundnut was seen to decline, probably due to greater warming. By evaluating all three crops, it is possible that there will be a definite decline in yield under the controlled conditions (without changing the level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>,) as discussed earlier. Under the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-enriched condition, the rice and groundnut crops responded better. However, sugarcane did not react to the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment. This might be due to the difference in their CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pathways. A successful adaptation at the local level requires a proper plan with short and long term perspectives that can be addressed using multiple pathways [

A variety of options can be put forth while planning for adaptations, including developing salt, heat and drought tolerant crops, adjusting the timing of farm operations, changing crop varieties and patterns, improving water use efficiency, and developing farm risk insurance [
