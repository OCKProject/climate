<p class="p">The projected yield of sugarcane during the End Century may be reduced by 3 to 1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180706.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). The relative yield change shows that the yield decline would be significant in the majority of the area in the interior of the study area. In the Near and Mid Century periods, there is likely to be a slight yield increase noted near the northeastern coastal areas. However, during the End Century period, little variation was noted even under the elevated CO
