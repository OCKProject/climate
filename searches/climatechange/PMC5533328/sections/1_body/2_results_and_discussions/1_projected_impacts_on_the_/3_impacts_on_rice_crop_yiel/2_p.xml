<p class="p">A study carried out by Geethalakshmi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0180706.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] projects a reduction in the yields of the same rice variety ADT 43 by 356 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> decade
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> for PRECIS model output, whereas the decline was 217 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for the RegCM3 output over the Cauvery Delta Zone simulated by the DSSAT without considering the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization. However, when the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect was considered, the PRECIS output showed a decreasing trend, whereas the RegCM3 projected an increased yield.
