<p class="p">The assessment of the impacts of future plausible climate change on rice crop yield showed that the yield levels vary highly among the different rice growing areas within the study area as well as over the different time periods in the 21st century (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180706.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The ADT 43 rice variety, which is commonly grown in the study area, was used as the test variety; and the simulations were made with and without a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. The yield projections using the CERES-Rice model showed that there will be a decrease in yield. The likely decline in yield for rice were 8.8%, 13.1%, and 18.73% under the control simulations for the time periods of Near, Mid, and End Century periods, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180706.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). In the case of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enriched scenario, the decline in the yield of rice was found to be 6.4%, 4.7%, and 4.4%, respectively.
