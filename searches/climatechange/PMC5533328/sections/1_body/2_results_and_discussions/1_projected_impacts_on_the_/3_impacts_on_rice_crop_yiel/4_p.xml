 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180706.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). As rice is highly sensitive to increases in ambient temperature variations, the simulation results produced by the CERES-Rice model showed that the crop yields under the elevated temperature conditions are likely to be affected severely. The crop yield reduction is likely to be least significant in the Near Century period as the yield reduction is projected to be 7 to 10%. The reduction is projected to be 11 to 15% in the Mid Century and in the range of 13 to 21% by the End Century period.
