<p class="p">The spatial distribution of projected crop yield changes for groundnut is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180706.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>. The relative yield changes in the groundnut crop shows a positive change for the Near and Mid Century simulations. During the End Century period, due to large changes in the temperature in the daytime as well as in the night time, the groundnut yield may tend to decline or fall by -3%. As far as relative yield change is concerned, the northwestern parts of Acharapakkam, Uttiramerur, Wallajabad, Kadambattur, Poondi, Gummidipoondi, etc., are likely to be affected badly. The other part of the study area will see a slight increase in groundnut yield under the changing scenarios of climate change.
