<p class="p">The slightest changes in the weather conditions may have a bearing on crop production, especially in an arid and semiarid tropical region like Tamil Nadu, India. This can become a prime factor influencing crop production. As the crops are highly susceptible to small changes in the microclimatic conditions, the estimates of future crop productivity at microscale would support appropriate actions in the future to curtail the potential impacts. Using the crop simulation models, the impacts on major crop yields were simulated and projected till the end of the 21st century by many researchers [
