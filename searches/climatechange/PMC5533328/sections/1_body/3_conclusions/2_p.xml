<p class="p">The results of the impact assessment show the areas that may require extra focus in crop production in the semiarid agro-ecological zones of South India. Micro-level analysis with high resolution climate details would be highly beneficial for better adaptation at the village level. These areas exhibit the highest degree of negative variation in crop yield, with conditions of high vulnerability expected in the later part of the 21st century. The study emphasized the priority for implementing adaptive management actions in the identified areas.</p>
