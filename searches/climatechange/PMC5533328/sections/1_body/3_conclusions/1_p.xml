<p class="p">Generating plausible crop yield change scenarios is possible with the help of regional climate and crop simulation models. The DSSAT crop simulation model is a very constructive tool for making important decisions for future agricultural operations. Major negative impacts with respect to changes in climate and crop yield are noticed for the rice crop, which is a major food crop in India. A more detailed study using a high resolution climate model at the village level would provide promising outcomes for micro-level adaptation assessments. Furthermore, this study has revealed that without timely adaptation, the food security and livelihood security would be at it risk using the climate change scenarios as described in RCP4.5. It is necessary to have a synergistic adaptation assessment and implementation plan that combines field level and scientific inputs (community based adaptations), but that also enhances the inherent capacity of the crops (ecosystem based adaptations) to withstand any future changes in climate. This study has also provided a systematic approach to explicitly identify vulnerable areas with respect to diminishing crop yields, where regional planners and policy makers can build on existing adaptation decision-making by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach in the context of global change scenarios.</p>
