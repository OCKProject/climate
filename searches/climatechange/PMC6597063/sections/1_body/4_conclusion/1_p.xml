<p class="p">In conclusion, the results of this research suggested that a large part of the north and west of Iran is suitable for the cultivation of walnuts. More than 582844 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (35.36%) of Iran’s total area are currently suitable for walnut cultivation. However, this study considered some parameters only, whereas several other restrictions exist which deserve further inquiry. These include the edaphic pH, along with the availability of water and the soil depth which could undermine the suitability of lands for walnut cultivation. It is an imperative to evaluate the micro-climate of each region and conduct observations in the field before establishing new orchards in each region. In general, the land suitability of walnut cultivation will decrease by 6.20% and reach 546710 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> during the next 30 years (2020–2049). Nonetheless, climate change will affect other environmental parameters including the availability of water, relative humidity, as well as the EC of the water and soil. Since climate change affects these factors too, the unpredictability of an uncertain future for walnuts could be even bleaker than the descriptions made in this research.
