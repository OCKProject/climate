<p class="p">The ultimate structure of mapping suitable lands for walnut cultivation in Iran was established here by combining the layers pertaining to the average air temperature in the growing season, the maximum temperature in summer, the minimum temperature in winter, the chilling requirement, the relative humidity of the air during the growing season, the altitude, land slope, EC of the soil, surface water and groundwater (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218725.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> illustrates the zoning of land suitability for walnut cultivation in Iran. It consists of cells, each of which has dimensions of 150 meters (2.2 ha). The results revealed that the total amount of unsuitable lands for walnut cultivation are 1065351 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (106535100 ha) which comprises 64.64% of the total area of Iran (
 <xref rid="pone.0218725.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The majority of unsuitable lands for walnut cultivation were in the south of Iran. These lands comprise parts of the provinces of Khuzestan (except a part of Andimeshk, Dezful, Masjed Soleiman and Izeh cities), Bushehr, Hormozgan (except a part of Haji Abad city), Sistan and Baluchestan and Fars (including Farashband, Mohr, Qir and Karzin, Khonj, Jahrom, Larestan, Zarin Dasht and Darab cities) and Kerman (including Qaleh Ganj, Rodbar-e-Jonubi, Manujan, Kahnuj, Anbarabad, Jiroft, Bam and Kerman cities). In addition to the south of Iran, the unsuitable lands were also mapped in parts of the central regions of Iran such as the south of Semnan and Yazd provinces (including Ardekan, Meybod, Behabad, Ashkezar and Yazd cities) and South Khorasan (except Nehbandan and Sariyan cities). These lands can be considered as unsuitable for walnut cultivation because of a lack of sufficient winter chill hours which are necessary to meet the chilling requirement. The mentioned lands are also characterized by unfavorably high EC values in the soil and in the water resources, along with high summer temperatures (higher than 38Â°C) (
