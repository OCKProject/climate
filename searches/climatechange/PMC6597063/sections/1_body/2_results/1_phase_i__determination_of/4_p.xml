 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (i.e. 16.70% of Iran’s total area) are of the “highly suitable” and “suitable” classes for walnut cultivation, respectively. In other words, minimal limits exist there for walnut production when considering the studied factors (i.e. soil and water EC, relative humidity, temperature, chilling requirement, altitude and land slope). The provinces in the range of Alborz, Zagros and Kopet Dagh mountains are considered as highly suitable and suitable areas for walnut cultivation. Parts of the Fars province, Kerman and Yazd are also among the highly suitable and suitable classes for the cultivation of walnut. In general, the available potential for walnut cultivation comprises about 35.36% of the country’s total area. The majority of this percentage is located in the northern, north-western and western margins of Iran (
