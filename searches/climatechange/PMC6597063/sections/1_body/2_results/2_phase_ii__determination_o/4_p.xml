<p class="p">Studying land suitability for walnut cultivation in the future of Iran (2020–2049) indicates that the overall appearance of the map overview will be almost identical to the current one. In general, as in the current situation, large parts of the southern and central regions of Iran will remain to be unsuitable for the production of walnuts in the future. In contrast, the northern, northwestern and western margins of Iran (across the Alborz, Zagros and Kopet Dagh Mountains) are currently considered and will continue to be in the “highly suitable” and “suitable” class of regions for the cultivation of walnuts (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218725.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) of land suitability in Iran shows that many areas that are currently in the “fairly suitable” class of regions for walnut cultivation will be turned into the “unsuitable” class. These include parts of Semnan province, Qom and Isfahan. Also, some “highly suitable” regions in the northwest of Iran (including Zanjan, Ardebil, and East Azarbaijan provinces) and some central regions of Iran (e.g. Isfahan province) will be downgraded to the “suitable” class of cultivation over the future period (
