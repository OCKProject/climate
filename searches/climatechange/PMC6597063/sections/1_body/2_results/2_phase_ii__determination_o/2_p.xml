<p class="p">Climate change and global warming have substantial effects on the number of chill hours in winter. It is estimated that a significant decrease will occur in the number of chill hours in the coming years [

 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This decline in the chill hours of winter can cause deprivations of the chilling requirement for many fruit trees in temperate regions and could reduce the vastness of the temperate zone [
 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The classification of Iranian regions in terms of the chilling requirement for the future period (2020â€“2049) showed that the southern provinces of Iran which are close to the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea (e.g., Sistan and Baluchistan, Hormozgan, and Bushehr) will continue to be unsuitable regions for the cultivation of walnuts for the coming years. This is mostly because of the inability of those regions in providing the chilling requirement of walnut trees.
