<p class="p">The current conditions suggest that 582844 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> out of 1648195 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in Iran are cultivable for walnut and are capable of meeting productive expectations. Based on the results, it is estimated that highly suitable lands for walnut cultivation in Iran will be reduced by 11.39% over the next 30 years (2020–2049) due to global warming. This decline in highly suitable lands would be from 150433 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 132525 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This also means that the reduced area of highly suitable lands will be approximately added to the “suitable” class of regions which will increase from 275213 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 293448 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. In other words, some of the “highly suitable” class for walnut cultivation in Iran is becoming “suitable” because of climate change. In general, during the next thirty years (2020–2049), climate change will take away 36,136 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the country from any prospect for walnut cultivation. Accordingly, 546710 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of Iran’s land will be suitable for walnut cultivation in the next 30 years. Furthermore, 66.83% of Iran’s land (i.e. 1101485 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) will become unsuitable for walnut cultivation, and only 33.17% (i.e. 546710 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the country’s area will be capable of hosting walnuts. The latter percentage is achieved by adding up the highly suitable, suitable and fairly suitable classes (
