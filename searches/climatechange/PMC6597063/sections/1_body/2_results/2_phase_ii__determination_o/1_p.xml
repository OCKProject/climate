<p class="p">By simulating the variations in the maximum and minimum temperatures for the future period (from 2020 to 2049), an increase in temperature (around 1.5°C) is indicated throughout all months of the year and in all regions of Iran (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218725.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). This is consistent with the predicted amounts of increase in the fifth report of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The most significant increase in temperature will be observed in the summer months, and the lowest increase is anticipated in the winter and spring. The minimum temperature in the northern half of Iran faces an average increase of 1°C during the winter and spring months. However, the increase will be higher in the southern half of the country and be 1.3°C. In the summer, minimum temperatures are expected to rise substantially in all areas of the country. This increase will be about 1.7°C. Maximum temperatures in the north and north-eastern parts of the country will experience an average increase of 1.53°C. Furthermore, this increase in maximum temperatures will be 1.5 to 1.7°C in December and May, but will be 1.8°C in the summer (
