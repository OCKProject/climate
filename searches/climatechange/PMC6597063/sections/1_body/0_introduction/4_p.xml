 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] evaluated Iran’s land for agriculture using GIS information. They reported that only 2.4% of Iran’s land is either suitable or highly suitable for agricultural crop production. Also, the majority of highly suitable lands for agriculture are located in the northern and western provinces of Iran [

The GIS approach has assisted the evaluation of land suitability for apple and pear cultivation in the Uttarankhand region, north of India, and it was reported that the south of Uttarankhand is more suitable for pome fruit production. In contrast, its upper hilly region was found to be unsuitable for the cultivation of apples and pears due to the presence of clay soils and chilling injuries [
