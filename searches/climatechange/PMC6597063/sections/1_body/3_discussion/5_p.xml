 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] showed that about 50% of the province (i.e. 1,904,307 hectares) is unsuitable for walnut cultivation. The northern parts of the Tehran province (including parts of Shemiranat, Firoozkooh and Damavand) and a southern part of the province (including a part of Varamin city) are unsuitable areas for walnut cultivation. The greatest limits to walnut cultivation in the north and south of the Tehran province are high altitude and high values of EC in the water and soil, respectively. In addition, the occurrence of high temperatures during the growing season is another limiting factor for walnut cultivation in Varamin, Tehran province. These results confirm a previous study on land suitability for walnut cultivation in the Tehran province [
