 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. According to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture [
 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and Soleimani et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218725.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], the production of walnut is mostly centered in the northern and western regions of the country. In the central regions of the country, as reported by the Ministry, only some parts of Isfahan, Kerman, Yazd, and Fars are observed to be under walnut cultivation. Accordingly, the accuracy of the map obtained in this study can be confirmed.
