<p class="p">The study of climate change and its effects on the land suitability of walnut cultivation in Iran showed that climate change is capable of increasing the temperature by 1–1.7°C during the growing season, and would reduce the number of chill hours in the winter by 50 hours over the next 30 years (2020–2049) [
