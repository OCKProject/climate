<p class="p">In the second phase, the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset was used, and land suitability for walnut cultivation was determined by considering an approach to climate change during the years 2020–2049. The NEX-GDDP climatic data were obtained from

For this purpose, the BCSD downscaling method was originally designed to process monthly data. This algorithm assumes that the biases in the current and future simulations follow the same pattern. To perform the BCSD algorithm, three databases are required: observational data, AOGCM model data for the base period and AOGCM model data for future periods. The bias correction is applied to the first and second databases. At first, the observation data and the base period of the AOGCM models are converted to the resolution (e.g. 0.1°×0.1°). Then, in each cell, the cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) of observation data and the base period of the AOGCM models are calculated. The relationship between these two CDFs has been established to draw a correlation. Finally, this relationship will be used for overriding the future data of the AOGCM model [
