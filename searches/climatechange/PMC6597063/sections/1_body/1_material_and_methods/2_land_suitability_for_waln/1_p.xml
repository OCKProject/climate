<p class="p">In the first phase, the climatic (maximum, average and minimum temperature, relative humidity and chilling requirement), edaphic (water and soil EC) and topographic (altitude and land slope) data of walnut production were used. The climate data obtained from the Iranian Meteorological Organization (375 synopetic stations). The climatic data included ambient temperatures in the growing season, minimum winter temperatures and the maximum temperature during the year, chilling requirement and relative humidity. The calculations were performed using long-term statistics (spanning from 30 to 67 years) among 375 synoptic stations in Iran. The ArcGIS software was used for analyzing the data. The climatic data from synoptic stations were interpolated by applying the Kriging method of prediction maps in the form of layers.</p>
