<p class="p">The ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) sensors provided information regarding altitude and land slopes. In this study, a digital elevation model (DEM) was used which had a precision of 150 m (5 seconds). Usually, a digital elevation model (DEM) is used in most spatial GIS analysis and can be used for mapping terrestrial slopes and their directions. It can assist various analyses in a three-dimensional fashion.</p>
