Highly suitable pedoclimate conditions are considered as ideal conditions for planting walnuts. Suitable conditions are lands which share a proximity with the ideal conditions for the planting. Fairly suitable conditions are those in which the cultivation of walnuts is possible but with some restrictions. Unsuitable conditions apply to conditions where the success of planting walnuts is not technically and economically feasible.
