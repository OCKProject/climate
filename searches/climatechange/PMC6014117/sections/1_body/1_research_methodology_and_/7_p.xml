 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:287) purport that the vulnerability of individuals and communities to climate change impact is not simply determined by the location of their settlements but also how these settlements are serviced, how effective and capable their local governments are and to what extent communities are able to cope with climate change impact. This implies that local municipalities as ‘settlements’ where communities live have to be effective and well serviced in order to assist communities in their struggle to adapt and mitigate climate change. However, if a municipality does not have a clear plan through an IDP of how they intend to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change, then the communities’ adaptive capacity is adversely affected.
