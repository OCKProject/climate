<p class="p">According to Roberts (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>:527), the extent to which an issue such as climate change becomes successfully institutionalised in day-to-day operations, planning and decision making at the local level by using institutional markers is outlined as follows. There is the emergence of an identifiable political or administrative champion(s) for climate change issues. These champions will assist the municipalities to ensure that climate change issues are involved and taken care of in all municipal operations. Then comes the appearance of climate change as a significant issue in mainstream municipal plans such as the IDP, Integrated Waste Management Plan, Environmental Plan, Spatial Plan and many more. This will be followed by the allocation of dedicated resources (human and financial) to climate change issues. Lastly, there will be a need to incorporate climate change considerations into political and administrative decision making.
