Climate change mitigation and adaptation have been the subject of discussion in many countries as the impact of climate change is experienced at the local level by communities. Thus, local governance systems are often ‘closest’ entities for planning and implementing both the adaptation and mitigation strategies suitable for a particular geographical and social context in which they are located (Pasquini, Cowling &amp; Ziervogel

 <italic class="italic">Municipal Systems Act</italic> (No. 32 of 2000), chapter 5, part 1, section 25, outlines that all municipalities are mandated to develop Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) (Department of Provincial and Local government

Therefore, the vulnerability of community from climate change depends on the policies and frameworks that the local municipality puts in place through the IDP.
