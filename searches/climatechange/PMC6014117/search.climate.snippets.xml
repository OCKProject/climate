  <result pre="based on three concepts, namely the vulnerability of municipalities towards" exact="climate" post="change, the adaptive capacity of communities to the impact"/>
  <result pre="change, the adaptive capacity of communities to the impact of" exact="climate" post="change and the mitigation strategies which should be included"/>

  <result pre="and to what extent communities are able to cope with" exact="climate" post="change impact. This implies that local municipalities as ‘settlements’"/>
