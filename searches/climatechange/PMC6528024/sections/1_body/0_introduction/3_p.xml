<p class="p">The ability of an ectotherm to thermally acclimate is thought to be linked to their opportunity for behavioural thermoregulation (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Angilletta 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>). Since thermoregulation is usually more challenging in water than on land, thermal acclimation may also depend on whether animals are terrestrial or fully aquatic (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2000
 </xref>). Indeed, showing a lower or even a complete lack of an acclimation response in terrestrial amphibians has been suggested to be due to the different thermal cues perceived in water and on land (

 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Seebacher 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2014
 </xref>) collated data from 202 ectotherms and suggested that thermal acclimation capacity of physiological traits was greater in ectotherms that live in more stable environments. They further suggested that aquatic animals might have a greater acclimation capacity compared to terrestrial ones. Consequently, tropical aquatic ectotherms living at lower latitudes can be expected to show a greater acclimation capacity. However, the opposite (i.e. ectotherms living at higher latitude having a greater acclimation capacity) was suggested previously by
