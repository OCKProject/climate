<p class="p">Overall, our results suggest that the tropical aquatic anuran 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic> may have its locomotor performance compromised by temperature changes due to deforestation or increases in global thermal maxima. However, the capacity to mitigate these effects through acclimation may be dependent on the type of trait measured. In the context of global climate change and habitat fragmentation, temperatures in the ponds of these animals in the wild are expected to increase (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beaumont 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011
 </xref>). Our results suggest that if 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic> faces long-term conditions of high temperature, they may suffer a decrease in stamina regardless of any daily temperature changes. Thermal acclimation at high temperature of burst performance capacity seems to not be affected by daily temperature changes. However, when acclimating this trait at low temperature, an acute increase of daily temperature seems to negatively affect performance resulting in potential consequences for their ability to escape predators or capture prey. On the other hand, the temperate aquatic anuran 
 <italic class="italic">X. laevis</italic> appears to not acclimate its burst performance and is thus directly impacted by changes in daily temperature, with jump force being negatively impacted by higher temperatures. Quantifying the thermal dependence of performance in this worldwide invasive species may consequently provide more accurate predictions of their future distribution limits under different global warming scenarios.
