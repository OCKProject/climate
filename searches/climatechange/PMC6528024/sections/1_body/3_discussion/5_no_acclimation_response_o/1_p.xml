 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Miller and Zoghby, 1986</xref>). As previous studies have demonstrated that early embryonic development can impact the ability of animals to acclimate at the tadpole stage (
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Seebacher and Grigaltchik, 2015</xref>), it would be of interest to test whether these effects are passed on to the adult stage. Similarly, it would be of interest to test whether exposure to different temperatures at the tadpole stage impacts the ability of adults to acclimate to different temperatures. If so, then this could explain contrasting results between these studies on thermal acclimation.
