<p class="p">Our results support previous reports on ectotherms (
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Seebacher 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>) showing that species living at low latitude (tropical species, 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic>) have greater acclimation capacity compared to species living at high latitude (temperate species, 
 <italic class="italic">X. laevis</italic>), at least for jump performance
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> However, our results also highlight that those responses might not be the same across a range of traits, as in 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic>, endurance capacity and jump force responded in different ways to acclimation temperature.
