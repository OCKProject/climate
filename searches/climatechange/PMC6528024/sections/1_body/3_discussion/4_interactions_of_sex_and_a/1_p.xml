<p class="p">In the frog 
 <italic class="italic">Litoria peronii</italic>, males showed an acclimation effect in the performance of the calling muscles and the muscles used during amplexus (
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rogers 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2007
 </xref>), whereas females did not. However, 
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rogers 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2007
 </xref>) detected no differences between sexes in the acclimation of the metabolic capacity of the ankle extensor muscle suggesting that only performance traits that are dimorphic may show interactions between sex and acclimation temperature. In our study, we only find a tendency for a sex-specific response to acclimation temperature, and to test temperature, for stamina in 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic>, which may be due to the relatively small sample size. Females acclimated at 29°C seemed to have a compromised stamina capacity compared to any other group. Males measured at 29°C degree (test temperature) seemed to have enhanced performance. A comparison between our final model and a model containing the interaction between sex and acclimation, as well as between sex and test temperature, showed a higher goodness of fit for the model containing the two-way interactions suggesting a non-negligible effect of sex. Because sex-specific response to acclimation may have strong influence on the evolution of a given trait, future experiments with increased sample size for each sex are necessary to confirm those relationships.
