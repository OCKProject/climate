<p class="p">Acclimation temperature affected stamina, independent of the test temperature. Indeed, irrespective of test temperature, animals were able to jump for longer when being acclimated at 24°C. However, burst performance capacity showed an interaction effect between acclimation temperature and test temperature. Indeed, animals acclimated at 24°C have their performance impacted by an acute change in test temperature. A previous study on 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> muscle performance found that isolated limb muscles in 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic> performed better (increase power output, shorter relaxation times) at higher temperature (up to 32°C;

 </xref>). Whole-animal performance in this species, however, shows somewhat lower optimal temperatures for burst performance and endurance capacity (27 and 22°C; 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Herrel and Bonneaud 2012a</xref>). In the present study animals maintained similar burst performance capacity at both test temperatures when acclimated at 29°C. Thus, only acclimation temperatures near the optimal temperature allow animals to optimize burst performance regardless of test temperature.
