<p class="p">Maximal exertion capacity was measured for 
 <italic class="italic">X. tropicalis</italic> only and was measured by chasing each individual down a 3 m long circular track until exhaustion, indicated by the unwillingness to move when touched and the lack of a righting response (inability to turn when animals are place on their backs; see 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Herrel and Bonneaud, 2012a</xref>). We retained the time moved until exhaustion as our measure of endurance capacity. Maximal jump forces were measured for both species using a piezo-electric force platform (Kistler Squirrel force plate, 0.1 N). The force platform (20 × 10 cm) was connected to a charge amplifier (Kistler Charge Amplifier type, 9865), and forces were recorded at 500 Hz, transferred to the computer and recorded using BioWare software (Kistler). Animals were placed on the force plate, allowed to rest for a few seconds and then induced to jump by unexpectedly clapping our hands behind the frogs (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2014
 </xref>). Two jump sessions with three to five jumps each on average were recorded, and the single most forceful jump was retained and used for further analyses. Forces in X, Y and Z-directions were extracted using the Kistler BioWare software, and the total resultant force (vector sum of the X, Y and Z-forces) was calculated.
