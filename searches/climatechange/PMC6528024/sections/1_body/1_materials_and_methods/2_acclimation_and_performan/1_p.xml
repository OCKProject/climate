 <italic class="italic">Xenopus tropicalis</italic> were split haphazardly in two groups. Group 1 was acclimated for 2 months at 29°C, close to the highest temperature they may encounter in the hottest month, and group 2 was maintained at 24°C, their laboratory temperature condition and close to the mean temperature of ponds at undisturbed forest sites. Next, performance was measured for all individuals at 24 and 29°C. Animals were then acclimated to the reciprocal temperatures for two months (group 1 at 24°C and group 2 at 29°C) and tested again at 24 and 29°C. Before the onset of performance measurements, animals were placed in individual containers with some water in an incubator, set to 24 or 29°C, for 1 hour. The same design was used for 
 <italic class="italic">X. laevis</italic> but animals were tested and acclimated at 23°C based on the average water temperature measured in the ponds where they were caught during the active season. Performance measurements were repeated twice over the course of 1 day and animals were given at least 1 hour of rest between trials. While resting, frogs were returned to the incubator set at the test temperature. At the end of the performance trials, animals had their pit tag numbers recorded, and they were returned to their aquaria and given food. Animals were given at least 1 week of rest between the different performance measures (exertion versus burst performance). All animals were in good health at the end of the experiments.
