 </xref>) with the individual identity as random factor on the intercept level. For each response variable (jump force and endurance capacity), we initially ran the model with acclimation temperature, test temperature, sex and all their interactions as main explanatory factor and body size (i.e. snout-vent length) as co-variable. We then proceed to remove each interaction factor, then single factors that were not significant in explaining the response variable (significance threshold was set at α = 0.05), and we compared goodness of fit between models using the anova() function in R. All statistical analyses were performed using the R software (
