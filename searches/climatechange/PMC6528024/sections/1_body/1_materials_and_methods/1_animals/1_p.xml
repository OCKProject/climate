 <italic class="italic">Xenopus tropicalis</italic> were caught in Cameroon in December 2009 and brought back to France (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 102; 50 females, 52 males). Frogs were housed at the Station d’Ecologie Experimentale du CNRS at Moulis, where they were maintained in groups of 8 to 10 individuals in aquaria (60 × 30 × 30 cm). Animals were maintained at a temperature of 24°C, similar to the temperature of water bodies measured in the field (22–26°C; see

 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic> were caught in a single pond in France (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 32; 20 females and 12 males). Animals were brought back to the Function and Evolution (FUNEVOL) laboratory at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Animals were maintained in groups of 6 to 10 individuals in 50-l aquaria in a

 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic> were maintained at a temperature of 23°C, close to their preferred body temperature and optimum temperature for burst performance (

 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Miller, 1982</xref>). The frogs were given 1 month to recover and were then pit tagged (NONATEC) allowing the unique identification of each individual. Frogs were fed twice weekly with beef heart, earthworms or mosquito larvae. All experiments were approved by the Institutional ethics committee at the MNHN (#68-25). All applicable international, national and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.
