 <p id="Par1" class="p">Deltas are widely threatened by sediment starvation and climate change. Erosion potential is an important indicator of delta vulnerability. Here, we investigate the erosion potential of the Yangtze Delta. We found that over the past half century the Yangtze’s sediment discharge has decreased by 80% due to the construction of &gt;50,000 dams and soil conservation, whereas the wind speed and wave height in the delta region have increased by 5–7%, and the sea level has risen at a rate of 3 mm/yr. According to hydrodynamic measurements and analyses of seabed sediments, the period when bed shear stress due to combined current-wave action under normal weather conditions exceeds the critical bed shear stress for erosion (
