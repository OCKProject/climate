 </sub>. The seabed of this delta tends to be erodible during peak tidal flow phases but non-erodible during slack water phases. Under fair weather conditions, the erodible period comprises nearly 50% of the duration during neap tides and nearly 80% of the duration during spring tides. During storm events, the shallow seabed can always be erodible. Dam-induced sediment starvation reduces the deposition flux during non-erodible periods. Thus, the erosion flux may exceed the deposition flux within the tidal cycle. Net delta erosion can be seen together with strong longshore currents, which can transport sediment southward. Over the next several decades, continuous erosion can be expected for the uppermost several metres of sediments in the subaqueous delta, considering that the Yangtze sediment discharge will further decrease due to the construction of new dams and that the energy of tides and waves in coastal ocean will likely continue to increase under global warming and sea level rise. Delta erosion will threaten ecosystems and engineering facilities (e.g., shallowly buried oil, gas pipelines, optical cables and seawalls). Subaqueous deltaic erosion and the processes controlling sediment erodibility need to be one of the key topics of studies on global coastal protection and restoration.
