<p id="Par18" class="p">The current Yangtze mouth includes four outlets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Prior to the 18th century, the North Branch was the main outlet of the Yangtze’s water and sediment discharge. During the 18th century, however, the major river flow shifted to the South Branch

 </sup>. Now, more than 95% of the Yangtze’s water and sediment flows into the sea via the three outlets of the South Branch

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>. The fine sediments from the Yangtze River formed a modern subaqueous delta off the Yangtze Estuary. Further seaward, this area is covered by Pleistocene relic sands

 </sup>, which were probably winnowed by the currents as the sea level rose since the Last Glacial Maximum. Coarse sands due to severe erosion between 1997 and 2012 were also found in the mouth area of the North Branch

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The Yangtze Estuary and adjacent waters are meso-macro tidal and influenced by monsoons. The wind speeds are highly variable, with multi-year averages of 4–5 m/s and a maximum of 36 m/s

 </sup>. During winter, a strong southward longshore current system develops under the influence of northerly monsoon winds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), transporting a bulk of sediment away from the Yangtze Delta. The deposition of this sediment has formed a Holocene mud wedge that is several hundred kilometres long in the inner continental shelf of the East China Sea
