<p id="Par20" class="p">The top sediment (the uppermost 30 cm) and core sediments were sampled in March 2012 and January–March 2013 using a box sampler and a gravity corer, respectively. Two high-resolution seismic profiles were collected after 2003 using a CHIRP sonar sub-bottom profiler (EdgeTech 0512i), and more details can be found in

One 600-kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP, four flow sensors with a 0.5 m bin size, 0.25 m blanking distance, Teledyne RD Instruments, Inc., California, USA) was used to measure the current velocity profile at sites A, B, C and D (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Another ADCP (1.0 MHz high-resolution profiler, Nortek AS, Norway), placed at 70 cm above the sediment surface and looking downward, was utilized to measure the current velocity profiles on the tidal flats at sites E, F and G (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The blanking distance was 40 cm, and the cell size was set to 2.5 cm. Each velocity profile was collected at a frequency of 1 Hz over a duration of 60 seconds during a burst interval of 5 minutes. The current velocity profile at an interval of 10 seconds continually lasted for at least 26 hours (more than 2 tidal cycles) at each site during both spring and neap tides. An SBE-26plus Seagauge (Sea-Bird Electronics, Washington, USA) was utilized to measure wave heights, wave periods, and water depths, etc., using a self-logging sensor. The sampling rate was set to 4 Hz over a duration of 256 seconds during each burst of 10 minutes. The sediment grain size was analysed in the laboratory using a Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyser, Beckman-Coulter Ls100Q (Beckman Coulter Inc., California, USA). The water content was defined as the ratio of the water weight to the dry sediment weight.
