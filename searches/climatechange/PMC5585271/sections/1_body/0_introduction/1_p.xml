<p id="Par2" class="p">Deltas, which are depositional systems of riverine sediments, are densely populated socio-economic centres. However, many deltas are now threatened by human-induced sediment starvation and climate change

 </sup>. In extreme examples, such as the Nile and Colorado deltas, sediment discharges have decreased to almost zero. In the Mississippi, Yellow and many other rivers, the sediment discharges to the sea have also declined by 60–90% in recent decades

 </sup>. Deltas’ response to sediment starvation and hydrodynamic increase depend on the contrast between the marine hydrodynamics and seabed sediment properties and can differ between rivers. Previous studies on delta erosion have mainly focused on coastline retreat

 </sup>. Less is known about the response of broad subaqueous deltas to sediment starvation due to a lack of bathymetric and stratigraphic data. Detecting erosion or determining the erosion potential in delta coasts is very important to both ecology and management because many oil pipelines and optic cables are shallowly buried beneath the seabed of deltaic coasts. Thus, an urgent need exists to investigate the erodibility and predict the erosion potential of subaqueous deltas, particularly for large rivers.
