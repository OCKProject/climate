<p id="Par4" class="p">During our study, the interannual variations of tidal ranges were relatively small with the difference between the minimum and maximum &lt;6%

 </sup>. Therefore, observations lasting for more than 2 tidal cycles during both spring and neap tides were conducted to study the average condition of hydrodynamics in the Yangtze Delta. In this study, we aim to investigate the hydrodynamic mechanisms of delta erosion under sediment starvation and predict the future erosion potential of the Yangtze subaqueous delta. Our objectives are to (1) determine the bed shear stress due to the combined current-wave action (

 <sub class="sub">cw</sub>), (2) determine the critical shear stress for the erosion of sediment (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cr</sub>), (3) compare the values of 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cw</sub> with those of 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cr</sub> and quantify the sediment erodibility, (4) ascertain the thickness of sediment that is erodible under sediment starvation and combined current-wave action, (5) discuss whether this subaqueous delta will experience extensive erosion and how long this erosion could continue.
