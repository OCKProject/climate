<p id="Par5" class="p">No evident trend (P ≫ 0.050) in annual water discharge from the Yangtze River was found, which has remained at a steady level of approximately 900 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/yr since the mid 1950s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). However, the riverine sediment discharge decreased very significantly (P &lt; 0.001) from approximately 500 Mt/yr in the 1950s to only approximately 130 Mt/yr in the 2010s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Thus, the riverine suspended sediment concentration exhibited a temporal trend (P &lt; 0.001) similar to the riverine sediment discharge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). In the meantime, slight increasing trends in both the annual wind speed (P &lt; 0.005) and significant wave height (P &lt; 0.005) were found during the past approximately 60 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d,e</xref>). The annual average wind speed increased from 5.70 m/s in the 1950s to 6.00 m/s in the 2010s, and the annual average significant wave height increased from 0.58 m in the 1950s to 0.63 m in the 2010s. The mean sea level in the northern East China Sea showed a significant rising trend (P &lt; 0.001), and the average rate of sea level rise was approximately 3 mm/yr during the past approximately 35 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>).
