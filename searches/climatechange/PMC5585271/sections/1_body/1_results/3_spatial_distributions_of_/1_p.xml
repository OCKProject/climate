<p id="Par9" class="p">The surficial sediment of the Yangtze Delta is overall small in grain size and high in water content. The median size (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values averaged 244 μm in the delta front off the North Branch and averaged only 18 μm in the areas offshore of the South Branch’s outlets (Fig.

The water content in the Pleistocene relic sands averaged 30%, whereas the water content in the Yangtze subaqueous delta averaged 53%. The spatial pattern of the water content was opposite to that of the grain size (Fig.
