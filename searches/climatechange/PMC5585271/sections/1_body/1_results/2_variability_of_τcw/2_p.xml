 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">cw</italic>
 </sub> on the intertidal flats was dominated by wave action during storm events and very shallow water phases of tidal cycles (water depth &lt; 0.5 m) under normal weather conditions. The mean wind speed at site G increased from 6.3 m/s under normal weather conditions to 11.5 m/s during peak storms (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), and in response, the mean significant wave height increased from 0.22 m to 0.65 m. The mean

  <italic class="italic">w</italic>
 </sub> was only 0.05 N/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> under normal weather conditions, while it increased to 0.85 N/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> during peak storms (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The maximum value for wave-induced shear stress even reached 1.62 N/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, which represented an increase of more than one order of magnitude compared to that under normal weather conditions. Meanwhile, the striking changes were also detected during pre-peak storm and post-peak storm periods compared to that under normal weather conditions at site G. The mean wind speeds were 9.0 m/s during pre-storm period and 7.8 m/s during post-peak storm period, and the mean significant wave heights were 0.29 m and 0.30 m accordingly. Therefore, the mean

 </sub> were 0.23 N/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> during pre-peak storm period and 0.24 N/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> during post-peak storm period.
