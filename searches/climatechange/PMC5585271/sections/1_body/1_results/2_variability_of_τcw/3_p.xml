<p id="Par8" class="p">Based on the historical data at Sheshan station, the hourly average of wind speed in the Yangtze Delta ranged from 0.01 to 24.1 m/s during the past 60 years, and the multi-year average was 5.8 m/s. Meanwhile, the hourly average of significant wave height ranged from 0.01 to 3.1 m, and the multi-year average was 0.6 m. During our observation of peak storms, the mean wind speed was 11.5 m/s and the mean significant wave height was 1.4 m at Sheshan station, which were both higher than 98% of the records (Supplementary Fig.
