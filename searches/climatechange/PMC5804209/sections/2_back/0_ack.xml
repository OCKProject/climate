 <p class="p">This study has been supported within multiple projects along the period spanning from 1978 to 2015. We thank many field workers, too numerous to be mentioned individually, whose help has been crucial to obtain the data used in this study. We are also grateful for their insightful criticisms and commentaries to 2 anonymous reviewers, to Simen Pedersen and the Hedmark University of Applied Sciences Conservation Biology class of 2015. Leah Kearns from the Landcare Research provided valuable editorial advice.</p>
