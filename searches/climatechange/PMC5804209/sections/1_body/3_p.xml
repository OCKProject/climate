<p class="p">The present study evaluates the long-term species composition and the possible role of local climate change in the small mammal community at the Doñana National Park (DNP), a large protected area located in southwest Spain which is part of the Mediterranean Basin hotspot. According to the hypothesis of climate effect on species distribution and abundance, we expect that species’ abundance vary in response to long-term climate change consistently with their climatic requirements. Therefore we predict that, with local climate warming, the abundance of species for which Doñana represents the southern limit of the distribution range will decrease whereas abundance of species at the northern limit will increase. We used 15 years of trapping data from a period spanning 37 years (1978–2015). First, we described the community dynamics as shown by the proportion of species captures for each campaign. Then, we tested the relationship between climate variation and temporal changes in the small mammal species abundances.</p>
