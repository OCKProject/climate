<p class="p">Trapping was performed through 15 years within a period spanning 37 years (1978–2015). We carried out 5 
 <italic class="italic">trapping campaigns</italic>, that is, periods of consecutive years of sampling funded by different projects: 1978–1981 (
 <xref rid="zow109-B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno 1984a</xref>), 1984–1985 (
 <xref rid="zow109-B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kufner 1986</xref>), 1986–1987, 2005–2007, and 2012–2015. Trapping data were collected over the 4 seasons except from 2012 onward when sampling was not performed on summer due to the very small number of captures typically made in that season. During each season and site there was a variable number of 
 <italic class="italic">trapping sessions</italic> which in turn consisted of a variable number of consecutive 
 <italic class="italic">trapping days</italic> over which data were collected.
