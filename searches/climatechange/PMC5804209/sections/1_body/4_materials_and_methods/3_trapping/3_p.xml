<p class="p">We focused on data at 2 different time-scales: (i) for the community species composition analysis we used the total number of captures for each species found at each 
 <italic class="italic">trapping campaign</italic>, whereas (ii) for the analysis of species abundances at each site we used the number of captured individuals at each 
 <italic class="italic">trapping day</italic> in winter. For the latter analysis, we focused on data from a single season because we needed to define yearly time-intervals short enough to assume that the population size remained approximately constant. We used data from winter because of the higher number of captures and of years for which trapping data were available. For the analysis of species abundances at each site we disposed of a variable number of years (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) as well as of 
 <italic class="italic">trapping sessions</italic> (San Agustin, min: 1, max: 4; Las Pajareras, min: 1, max: 2; Las Monjas, min: 1, max: 1) and of consecutive 
 <italic class="italic">trapping days</italic> (San Agustin, min: 3, max: 7; Las Pajareras, min: 4, max: 7; Las Monjas, min: 5, max: 7). Different numbers of traps were used in each area over the entire study period (min: 50, max: 150 traps/day, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for details) but we accounted for this variation in the statistical analyses.
