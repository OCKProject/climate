<p class="p">Each trapping area was approximately 1 hectare, and separated from the other sites by at least 1,000 m to ensure independence of data (i.e., no interchange of individuals among sites,

The trapping method was consistent throughout the study period. We used 2 types of live-traps that yielded similar capture rates (personal observation): Sherman’s live-traps and similar traps manufactured by the technical staff. All the traps were baited with bread soaked in fish oil and placed across a grid, 15 m apart. They were installed just before sunset of the first day and checked each day 2 h after sunrise. Each trapped specimen was individually marked when first captured. Three methods were used to mark animals: toe-clipping (1978–2007), subcutaneous microchip (2005–2007), and color points micro-tattooing in the tail (2012–2015).
