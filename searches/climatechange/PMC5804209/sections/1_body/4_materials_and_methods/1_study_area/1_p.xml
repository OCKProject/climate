<p class="p">This study was conducted in DNP (37° N, 6°10′ W), a plain area (0–106 m a.s.l.), located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Guadalquivir River mouth on the Atlantic ocean. This area is one of the most important natural reserves in Europe, designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1980 with a special protection status. The climate is Mediterranean sub-humid with 2 marked seasons: wet mild winters (mean temperature in January ≈ 10 °C) and dry warm summers (mean temperature in August ≈ 25 °C) (

Three main biotopes can be distinguished in DNP: (1) marshes on a clay area with a regular flood pattern during winter; (2) mobile sand dunes parallel to the sea coast; and (3) scrubland that, according to proximity to the water table, is either xerophytic Mediterranean scrubland (drier), or hygrophytic Atlantic scrubland (more humid) (
