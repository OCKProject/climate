<p class="p">Methodological issues typically hinder the study of climate effects on dynamics of populations, species, and communities. First, these studies require long-term data collected over a time span broad enough to include climate variations. Second, analyses of counts and presence/absence data should account for imperfect detection to avoid spurious findings (

 <xref rid="zow109-B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lebreton et al. 1992</xref>) may be difficult to be obtained because of data sparseness and/or limited sample sizes. In these cases, another class of models, so-called Hierarchical Models (HMs, see

These models can tease apart variation of the latent (unobserved) variable/s (e.g., abundance, species occurrence) by variation in the observation process (e.g., imperfect detection of individuals or species). More details on the conceptual framework behind HM are given in
