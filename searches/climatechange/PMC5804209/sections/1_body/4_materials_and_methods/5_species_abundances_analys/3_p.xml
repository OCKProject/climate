<p class="p">As predictors of abundance in winter, we considered local climatic data collected by a weather station in close proximity to the study areas (downloaded from

We considered: (i) the average daily mean temperatures, (ii) the total rainfall, and (iii) the number of extremely hot days, that is, with a mean temperature higher than the 90th percentile of the daily mean temperatures in autumn calculated throughout the entire study period (
