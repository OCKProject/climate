 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Appendix S1</xref>). To avoid inflated type I error, we considered models separated by less than 2 AICc as equally plausible (
 <xref rid="zow109-B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>). First, we modeled the capture probability by considering models with all the possible combinations of the above mentioned predictors (3, 2, 1, or no effect) and holding the abundance constant (only intercept). Then, we retained the model structure for the capture probability from the model with the lowest AICc value and used it to model abundance. For the sake of parsimony, we only considered models with one abundance predictor for each model. By doing so, we finally attained a list of models sorted by growing AICc values, each one representing a specific hypothesis about abundance changes. This approach allowed us to keep the number of tested models as low as possible and address simple hypotheses (
