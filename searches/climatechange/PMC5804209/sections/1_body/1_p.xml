<p class="p">Recent studies on ecological effects of climate change have mainly focused on how they affect the species geographical distribution, physiology, phenology, and local abundances (

As well as long-term trends, unpredictable and fast changes in local climate conditions over short periods (so-called “extreme events”) have an important but often overlooked effect on the distribution and persistence of species (
