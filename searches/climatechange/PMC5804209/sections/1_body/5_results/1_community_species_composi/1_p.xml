<p class="p">Species proportional composition has varied substantially over the study period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zow109-F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Eliomys quercinus</italic> showed a marked decline between the 1978–1981 and 1986–1987 campaigns, after which the species was never trapped again. 
 <italic class="italic">Rattus rattus</italic> was captured only in the first campaign. Low numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">C. russula</italic> were captured during all the campaigns except the last (2014–2015), when it was not captured at all. Although the number of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> trappings was substantial throughout the first 3 campaigns, it declined markedly in the last 2 (from 2005 onward). The only species that showed a marked increase over the 5 campaigns was 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic>, which represented only a small fraction of total captures in the first campaign to become the most captured species in the last 2 (2005–2015).
