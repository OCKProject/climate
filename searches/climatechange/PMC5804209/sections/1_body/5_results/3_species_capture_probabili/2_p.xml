<p class="p">At Las Pajareras, the best model for capture probability of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> accounted for a positive relationship with the number of traps (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). From this model, we estimated an average daily capture probability that resulted to be the highest we found (0.524; 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 0.073) among all the species and sites. For 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic>, we found a positive relationship of number of traps on capture probability also at Las Monjas (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The average daily probability of capture was 0.223 (
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 0.096).
