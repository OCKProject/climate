<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> at San Agustin, the inverse relationship with mean temperature was selected as the most parsimonious model for abundance (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="zow109-T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, a positive relationship with rainfall and the number of extremely hot days could not be ruled out (ΔAICc &lt; 2). Based on the lowest AICc model, we estimated the mean abundance for each sampling year that varied between a minimum of 2.05 individuals (
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 1.55; Temperature = 16.86 °C) and a maximum of 4.95 individuals (
