<p class="p">Although often not appreciated in past ecological research, counts can provide little information on ecological processes if the level of detectability is not maintained over time and space. HMs overcome this problem by accounting for changes in the observational process (
 <xref rid="zow109-B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kery and Royle 2016</xref>). HMs are gaining popularity among ecologists as a robust approach for studying changes in abundance and distribution also with historic records (see e.g., 
 <xref rid="zow109-B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iknayan et al. 2014</xref>). Using HMs, we found that probability of capture varied according to the number of traps or daily mean temperature. Although such effects were in the expected directions (negative effect of temperature and positive of number of traps) for most cases, we cannot explain why the capture probability for
