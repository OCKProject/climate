<p class="p">Albeit other processes such as top-down control and species competition were likely to be involved, our findings support a relationship between changes in the local climate conditions and small mammal community whose diversity declined remarkably at DNP. Such a reduction in diversity and abundance of small mammals is alarming especially for species like, among others, 
 <italic class="italic">T. alba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Genetta genetta</italic> whose diet, breeding success, and other ecological parameters depend on small mammals abundance.
