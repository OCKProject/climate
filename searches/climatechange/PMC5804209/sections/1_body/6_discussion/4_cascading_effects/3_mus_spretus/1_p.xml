<p class="p">The number of extremely hot days correlated negatively with the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> at DNP. Although caution is needed as data from only 5 years were modeled, this finding is surprising as 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> is adapted to high temperatures (
 <xref rid="zow109-B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Palomo et al. 2009</xref>). However, extreme high temperatures are known to be a cause of heat stress in birds (
 <xref rid="zow109-B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jenouvrier 2013</xref>) and even mortality for some species of mammals (
 <xref rid="zow109-B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Greenville et al. 2012</xref>). Although the ecological impacts of extreme events are still poorly understood (
 <xref rid="zow109-B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thibault and Brown 2008</xref>), it has been proposed that they might turn local systems into ecological traps by increasing the extent of trophic mismatches (
 <xref rid="zow109-B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiguet et al. 2011</xref>). In the future, extreme events are going to increase in multitude and magnitude (
 <xref rid="zow109-B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Easterling et al. 2000</xref>); this pattern was already evident at DNP for the study period (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We encourage that further studies on small mammal diversity at Do√±ana explicitly address the potential effects of extreme climatic events.
