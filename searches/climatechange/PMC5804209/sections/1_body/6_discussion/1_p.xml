<p class="p">Trapping records indicate that from late 1970s to the present time the small mammal community at DNP has exhibited a marked change in species composition. In the last 4 years 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic>, the species most adapted to dry conditions, accounts for almost all captures. In addition, for all the cases where sufficient data were available, we found a relationship between local climate change and abundance (
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> in the 3 study areas and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> in 1). Simultaneously, there was a trend toward increased temperatures and decreased rainfall (

Although other non-exclusive environmental factors are likely to be involved, our findings support the hypothesis that long-term climate change played a role in the local small mammals population dynamics.
