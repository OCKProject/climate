 <xref rid="zow109-B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mysterud et al. 2002</xref>). Indeed, physiological mechanisms can be directly triggered by climate change (
 <xref rid="zow109-B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parmesan 2006</xref>). Besides, indirect climate effects may operate by affecting the species’ ecological niches by means of changes in the environment where they live or in the interspecific relationships (

 <xref rid="zow109-B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilman et al. 2010</xref>). Climate warming is affecting the distribution of species toward higher latitudes and elevations (

 <xref rid="zow109-B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Myers et al. 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="zow109-B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al. 2011</xref>). As an example, a recent study based on barn owl 
 <italic class="italic">Tyto alba</italic> pellet analysis from multiple locations in Italy showed a consistent increase of xerothermophilic species in the small mammal communities since late 70s (
 <xref rid="zow109-B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Szpunar et al. 2008</xref>). Coherent with this scenario we found that, 
 <italic class="italic">E. quercinus</italic>, a species more related to colder climates than that of Doñana which represents the southern limit of its distributional range, has gradually disappeared from the trapping records. Conversely, 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic>, distributed in the warm climates of southwest Europe and the western Mediterranean coast of Africa, currently represents nearly all of the species captured. The hypothesis of climate effect was also supported by the observed relationships between abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> with, respectively, the amount of rainfall and the number of extremely hot days in the preceding autumn. Our study cannot reveal which mechanisms, if any, modulated the effects (direct or indirect) of climate variation on the DNP small mammal diversity and abundances. It is possible that their fate at Doñana depended on different physiological responses to climate change (
 <xref rid="zow109-B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al. 2011</xref>). For instance, lower rainfall during the reproductive peak (autumn) might have determined a reduction in the undergrowth and shrubs that are crucial for 
 <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> and not for 
 <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> which prefers open habitats (
