<p class="p">Because of their short lifespan and fast life-history responses to environmental changes, small mammals are ideal model species for studying climatic effects on animal population dynamics. Furthermore, they play an important role in their ecosystems as seed dispersers, predators, and main preys of several mammalian carnivores and raptors (

Recently, it has been shown that the elevational limits of many small mammal species in the Yosemite National Park (N America) have shifted northward consistent with the ∼3°C increase of minimum temperature during the last century (

 <xref rid="zow109-B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Myers et al. 2009</xref>) with collections’ records of small mammals in the Great Lakes region has shown a marked decline in the presence of northern species accompanied by an increase of southern species over a period similar to the present study. Others have shed light on some mechanisms that modulate the effects of climate on small mammals dynamics. For instance,

(2008)</xref> found that reduction and duration of the subnivean space induced by warming-climate had a negative impact on survival and reproductive performance of Fennoscandian rodents consequently altering their cycles. Moreover, studies from paleontological data have linked ancient climate change on the distribution of small mammal species (
