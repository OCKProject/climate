 <p class="p">Climate change affects distribution and persistence of species. However, forecasting species’ responses to these changes requires long-term data series that are often lacking in ecological studies. We used 15 years of small mammal trapping data collected between 1978 and 2015 in 3 areas at Doñana National Park (southwest Spain) to (i) describe changes in species composition and (ii) test the association between local climate conditions and size of small mammal populations. Overall, 5 species were captured: wood mouse 
  <italic class="italic">Apodemus sylvaticus</italic>, algerian mouse 
  <italic class="italic">Mus spretus</italic>, greater white-toothed shrew 
  <italic class="italic">Crocidura russula</italic>, garden dormouse 
  <italic class="italic">Eliomys quercinus</italic>, and black rat 
  <italic class="italic">Rattus rattus</italic>. The temporal pattern in the proportion of captures of each species suggests that the small mammal diversity declined with time. Although the larger species (e.g., 
  <italic class="italic">E. quercinus</italic>), better adapted to colder climate, have disappeared from our trapping records, 
  <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic>, a small species inhabiting southwest Europe and the Mediterranean coast of Africa, currently is almost the only trapped species. We used 2-level hierarchical models to separate changes in abundance from changes in probability of capture using records of 
  <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic> in all 3 areas and of 
  <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic> in 1. We found that heavy rainfall and low temperatures were positively related to abundance of 
  <italic class="italic">A. sylvaticus</italic>, and that the number of extremely hot days was negatively related to abundance of 
  <italic class="italic">M. spretus</italic>. Despite other mechanisms are likely to be involved, our findings support the importance of climate for the distribution and persistence of these species and raise conservation concerns about potential cascading effects in the Doñana ecosystem.
