<p id="Par5" class="p">Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use are a substantial contributor to global emissions, particularly carbon (C) stock changes from land-use conversion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. For example, deforestation, i.e., converting forests to non-forest uses (e.g., settlements) leads to oxidation of organic matter in the tree biomass, litter and dead wood pools both onsite and offsite, and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) to the atmosphere, as well as emissions of other non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> GHGs where burning occurs. Afforestation and reforestation have the potential to reverse this process resulting in a net uptake of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere. Such a dynamic was exhibited in the United States during the twentieth century as former croplands were abandoned and reverted to forest in many cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Land-use conversion also influences soil C pools. For example, cultivation of land leads to a release of soil C ranging from 30 to 60% of the original stock in the topsoil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Adopting conservation tillage, particularly no-till, can increase soil C stocks due to physical protection of organic matter in aggregates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Changing crop production practices, such as planting improved varieties or changing fertilization and irrigation practices can also have an impact on soil C stocks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Land use can have a profound effect on trajectories of terrestrial C sinks and sources, as well as other GHG fluxes, and consequently, quantifying the impacts of land use and land-use change is a fundamental component of national GHG inventories.
