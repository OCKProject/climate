<p id="Par24" class="p">Overall, the implementation criteria provide a link between the definition and the specific data that are needed to delineate the managed land base. Criteria are implemented using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into land uses. Lands that are used for crop production or settlements are all assigned as managed using the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Active fire management is determined from maps of federal and state management plans from the National Atlas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] and Alaska Interagency Fire Management Council [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Forest lands managed for timber harvests are informed by county level estimates of timber products reported in the U.S. Forest Service Timber Products Output Reports database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Lands maintained for recreational purposes are determined from analysis of the United States Protected Areas Database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] in which lands are classified as managed if there is suppression of natural disturbances or that are used for extractive or recreational purposes. Multiple data sources are used to delineate areas with active resource extraction, including the Alaska Oil and Gas Information System [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>], Alaska Resource Data File [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>], Active Mines and Mineral Processing Plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], and Coal Production and Preparation Report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. A buffer of 3300 and 4000 m is applied around petroleum extraction and mine locations, respectively, to account for the footprint of operations and impacts of activities on the surrounding landscape. Accessibility is a criterion unique to the United States among these three countries, and is a key determinant of managed area in remote areas of Alaska. Accessibility is determined using a 10 km buffer surrounding road and train transportation networks with the ESRI Data and Maps product [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>], and a 10 km buffer surrounding settlements using the NLCD.
