<p id="Par20" class="p">The Atlas of Canada is used to determine the spatial extent of wetlands based on an inventory of wetlands, including those covered by forest at a national scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has provided a map showing the principal peat harvesting areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>] and an estimate of the wetland area managed for peat extraction in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Estimates of the area under peat extraction for previous and subsequent years are made by adjusting the 2004 value on the basis of peat production. Flooded lands are delineated based on (1) forest conversion mapping [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>], (2) the Canadian Reservoir Database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>], and (3) hydroelectric industry consultations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Emissions from reservoirs are reported only for the 10Â years following impoundment, and all flooding events that have occurred since 1980 are considered managed wetlands.
