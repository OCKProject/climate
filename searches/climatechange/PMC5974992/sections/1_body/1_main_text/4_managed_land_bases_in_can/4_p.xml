<p id="Par28" class="p">The total managed land base in the United States is 890 million hectares, and about 46 million hectares are unmanaged (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Managed land includes the majority of the territory in the conterminous 48 states and Hawaii, where much of the land is actively managed for crop production, grazing livestock, timber production, or occurs within settlement areas. Moreover, the majority of the land in these regions is within a 10 km buffer of the road network, railroad corridors or settlements. There are large blocks of land in Alaska that are classified as unmanaged, which are grassland, forest land or wetland. These areas are largely inaccessible, which means that they are outside the 10 km buffer of road networks or other transportation corridors, and have no direct human management or function in which anthropogenic activities are influencing GHG emissions.
