<p id="Par37" class="p">According to the IPCC, it is good practice to be transparent about the methods that are used for estimating and reporting GHG emissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Based on our review, governments could be more transparent about their application of the managed land proxy in national communications. Many communications do not explicitly mention managed land even though the concept is implicitly applied by the 97 government that are using the later guidance from the IPCC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] based on our review. Specifically, governments could provide a definition for managed land and implementation criteria. If some of the land is not managed, then it would also be useful to provide a map with the spatial distribution of managed and unmanaged land. In addition, changes in the managed land base over time should be reported, and the effect of those changes on emission and removals.
