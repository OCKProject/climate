<p id="Par36" class="p">The exclusion of unmanaged lands may lead to scientifically incomplete understanding of the greenhouse gas fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere. For example, much of the unmanaged land areas in Canada and Alaska contain deep organic layers and permafrost that are susceptible to a range of climate change impacts from thawing, water table changes if ice melt allows water to drain, and wildfires [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The response of these lands to climate change and the associated emissions could have significant impacts on the global C cycle (both CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). While it would not be appropriate to report these as anthropogenic emissions, the fluxes can have important implications for global policies aimed at achieving GHG reduction targets or atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration targets. If emissions from unmanaged forests, peatland or permafrost C (positive feedback) use up some of the remaining “allowance” for C emissions to the atmosphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], then mitigation efforts in all other sectors have to increase to meet the global CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reduction targets. While currently there are no UNFCCC requirements for monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from these areas by governments because they are designated as unmanaged, including these areas could contribute more certainty to the outcomes of policy programs intended to limit the impact of anthropogenic GHG emissions on the climate system.
