<p id="P18" class="p">The aim of this paper is to provide the necessary scientific background to understand the relevance of and implications for selecting a particular ozone metric to assess spatial and temporal variation in ozone relevant for a particular impact. To achieve this, prior to discussion of the 25 TOAR metrics themselves (4 for model-measurement comparison, 5 for characterization of ozone in the free troposphere, 11 for human health impacts, and 5 for vegetation impacts) in 
 <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref>, the basic scientific information (
 <xref rid="S5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Sections 2.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.2</xref>) underpinning of these metrics is provided. Specifically, we first discuss for human health and vegetation effects the concept of exposure and dose. After introducing these concepts, we describe the scientific evidence, based on controlled experimental studies, empirical observations, and epidemiological research, which provide the background on why specific ranges of ozone levels are associated with individual metrics and why at times the metrics behave differently under changing environmental conditions. In the TOAR effects papers (

 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Health</italic>); 
 <xref rid="R135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al., 2017</xref> (hereinafter referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Vegetation</italic>)), only exposure metrics are applied to characterize present-day ozone observations and trends over time. Data for dose metrics were not available to use by TOAR. Metrics are also specifically defined that can be used to evaluate the ability of global models to reproduce observed patterns of ozone spatio temporal variability.
