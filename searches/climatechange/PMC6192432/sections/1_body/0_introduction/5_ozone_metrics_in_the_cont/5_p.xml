The assessment report is organized as a special issue of

It is important to note that while the specific ozone-related metrics discussed in this paper relate to TOAR, there exist other metrics used for research and regulatory purposes. Some of these metrics relate to ozone radiative forcing, ozone production efficiency, and “design values” associated with the US EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
