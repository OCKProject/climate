<p id="P22" class="p">As described above, controlled experimental studies, empirical observations, and epidemiological research provide the underpinnings that determine the specific ranges of ozone levels associated with the individual metrics. In 
 <xref rid="S35" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4</xref>, we discuss the response of the various metrics to changes in the distribution of hourly average concentrations, which influence the magnitude of the metric, and the magnitude and direction of change in that part of the distribution. Trends in exposure metrics may change in the same direction as emissions change or may not (

The extent to which a human health ozone exposure metric is influenced by low, moderate, or high ozone levels determines whether the metric has decreased, increased, or not changed. A common change in ozone concentration distribution can result in dissimilar trends in health and vegetation metrics because they may differentially emphasize low, moderate, or high ozone levels. It is in fact not uncommon for one metric to show a positive, statistically significant trend, while another shows a negative trend, also significant, for the same ozone time series.
