<p id="P21" class="p">As a part of the TOAR program, an important consideration is the selection of appropriate statistical tests that can be consistently applied across thousands of measurement sites to quantify changes in distributions and metrics. In 
 <xref rid="S25" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 3</xref>, we discuss some of the statistical approaches available for characterizing trends, as well as the key assumptions associated with these approaches. The rationale by TOAR for selecting the nonparametric Mann-Kendall (M-K) test to identify significant trends and the Theil-Sen (T-S) estimator for estimating the magnitude of the trend is provided.
