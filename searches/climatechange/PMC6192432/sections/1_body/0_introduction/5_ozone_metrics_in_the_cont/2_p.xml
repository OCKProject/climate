<p id="P17" class="p">A key aspect of TOAR is to produce an integrated, global assessment of ozone by extending analyses previously undertaken only in specific regions. TOAR has compiled the world’s largest database of ozone observations from sites around the world, and therefore facilitates the comparison of monitoring data on local, regional, national, and international scales. However, as indicated above, there are still many parts of the world which remain undersampled. The database contains several datasets that have been collected for scientific purposes, and TOAR applies globally uniform analyses to measurement series across the world. Most of the metrics described in this paper are available as online service from the TOAR database (

When referencing an ozone observation, which is measured from moist, ambient air, TOAR follows World Meteorological Organization guidelines (
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galbally et al., 2013</xref>) and uses the mole fraction of ozone in air, expressed in SI units of nmol mol
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. Ozone metrics (e.g., annual 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest 8-h daily maximum average ozone value) have typically been developed using the mixing ratio unit of parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) which, in the case of ozone, refers to the number of ozone molecules per million or billion moist, ambient air molecules in a fixed volume. In reference to units of nmol mol
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> and ppb, 
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galbally et al. (2013)</xref> states: “For all practical purposes the two quantities can be used interchangeably and without distinction”. To maintain consistency with the ozone human health and vegetation research community, TOAR uses units of ppb or ppm (or ppb-hrs or ppb h for cumulative indices) when discussing ozone in terms of an exposure metric. Although the usage of the word “concentration” without specifying atmospheric conditions when referring to mole fraction (nmol mol
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and mixing ratios (ppb) is technically incorrect, the vast amount of literature on ozone health and vegetation effects uses the conventional term “concentration” when referring to an ozone level. This common usage does not distinguish between mixing ratio metrics or true concentrations metrics such as μg m
 <sup class="sup">–3</sup>. To enhance the link to the health and vegetation effects literature and national and international policy, as well as to facilitate the understanding of this paper by health and vegetation effects scientists, the word “concentration” is used when appropriate. Here, we define ‘metrics’ as indices derived from hourly (or higher time resolution) ozone measurements and estimates, which are identified later in the paper to be relevant for assessment of the impacts of ozone on human health, vegetation, model-comparison, or characterization of ozone in the free troposphere. Metrics are calculated by averaging or aggregating ozone data over relevant time periods or as expressed as statistical descriptions of the ozone distribution (see
