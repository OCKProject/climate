<p id="P16" class="p">In addition to changes in local and regional anthropogenic precursor emissions described above, trends in surface hourly ozone distributions can be influenced by other factors. First, ozone may be impacted by changes in meteorology induced by year-to-year variations in weather conditions and by long-term changes associated with climate change. Relationships have been demonstrated between observed surface ozone and individual meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, surface radiation, boundary layer depth, and boundary layer ventilation and stagnation (

 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fiore et al., 2015</xref>). Modeling studies also indicate that future climate change may lead to both (1) increases in surface ozone, especially in polluted areas (

 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fiore et al., 2015</xref>), and (2) potentially some decreases in surface ozone levels through enhanced boundary layer ventilation (
 <xref rid="R192" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trail et al., 2014</xref>). Such influences could impose either a climate penalty – an increase in surface ozone in the absence of changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions (
 <xref rid="R215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2008</xref>) or a climate benefit – a reduction in surface ozone (
 <xref rid="R192" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trail et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, modeling studies suggest that climate-driven changes in stratosphere-troposphere exchange could influence surface ozone at a particular location (e.g.,

 </sub>, and wild-fires) either from inter-annual meteorological variability, climate change, or land-use change can also influence surface ozone (e.g.,

 <xref rid="R207" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">von Schneidemesser et al., 2015</xref>). These changes can either shift the entire distribution of hourly ozone (e.g., from methane increases) or can contribute to discrete extreme hourly ozone events (e.g., from wildfires). Third, ozone levels and trends may be impacted by changes in long-range transport. For example, at Mace Head, a site located on the west coast of Ireland, observations of monthly averaged ozone concentrations associated with air masses that had minimal influence from European emissions were noted to have increased significantly between 1987 and 2008, before leveling off and decreasing (
