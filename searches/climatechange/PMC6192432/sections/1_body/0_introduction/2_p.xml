Data from widespread observational networks, operational since the 1970s, provide hourly average ozone data from thousands of surface monitoring sites across the globe, and vertical information is available from ozonesondes, aircraft, and satellites (

 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Surface Ozone Database</italic>). The data from these networks continue to increase our understanding of ambient ozone levels and their possible impacts on human health, vegetation, and climate change. In addition, this information provides a better understanding about tropospheric ozone distributions, their variability, and long-term changes which are also simulated by global chemistry models (e.g.,
