 <list list-type="bullet" id="L2" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P10" class="p">Which regions of the world have the greatest human and plant exposure to ozone pollution?</p>

   <p id="P13" class="p">How can the atmospheric sciences community facilitate access to ozone metrics necessary for quantifying ozone’s impact on climate, human health, and crop/ecosystem productivity?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list> To assist in answering these questions, the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC) developed the 
 <italic class="italic">Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR): Global metrics for climate change, human health and crop/ecosystem research</italic> (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.igacproject.org/activities/TOAR" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.igacproject.org/activities/TOAR</ext-link>). Initiated in 2014, TOAR’s mission is to provide the research community with an up-to-date scientific assessment of tropospheric ozone’s global distribution and trends from the surface to the tropopause. TOAR’s primary goals are to: 1) produce the first global tropospheric ozone assessment report based on the peer-reviewed literature and new analyses, and to 2) generate easily accessible, documented data on current ozone exposure and dose metrics as well as trends in these same metrics at thousands of measurement sites around the world (urban and non-urban).
