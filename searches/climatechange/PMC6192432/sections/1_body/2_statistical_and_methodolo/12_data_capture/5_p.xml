<p id="P126" class="p">Based on established practices and some tests on selected data series, a general data capture criterion of 75% was applied in all TOAR analyses. This data capture threshold is applied on various levels. For example, to calculate a valid 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily 8-hour maximum value in a year, there must be 75% of hourly values available in each (running) 8-hour averaging interval, then there must be 75% of valid 8-hour intervals during a day, and finally, 75% of valid days in a year. The data capture criteria for each of the TOAR exposure metrics are summarized in the supplement of
