<p id="P128" class="p">Performing trend analyses by season versus an entire year of data is an important consideration. Some states in the US are required to only monitor during the “ozone season”, which historically have been as short as June-September and as long as January–December. TOAR requires 75% of the full calendar year data for all of the annual TOAR metrics. For sites in the TOAR database that do not operate year-round, missing values are reported for annual exposure metrics. For TOAR metrics determined for a summer period, the 6-month April–September (Northern Hemisphere) and October–March (Southern Hemisphere) periods are used. The TOAR database produces daily and monthly exposure metrics and thus, users who wish to create their own season definitions have the ability to do so. A complete description of the data validation criteria is described in
