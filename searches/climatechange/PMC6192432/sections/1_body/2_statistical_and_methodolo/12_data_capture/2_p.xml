<p id="P123" class="p">Data capture (i.e., the amount of valid hourly data available in a given sampling period in which aggregation is applied) may have strong impacts on the derived metrics or trend estimate. It is easily seen that a measurement series consisting only of a few nighttime measurements during winter will not reflect photochemical ozone maxima which occur during daytime in summer. Consequently, any evaluation of metrics, which focus on the higher part of the distribution from such data series, would be meaningless. In reality, the vast majority of ozone measurement series are more or less complete so that the derived metrics and trend parameters can generally be assumed to be robust. However, there is a margin of uncertainty in this statement of “more or less”, and the reader should be aware of the possible implications of incomplete data series.</p>
