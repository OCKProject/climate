<p id="P127" class="p">If the data capture at a site is poor, the data should not be combined with another siteâ€™s data unless there are circumstances that can be well documented. For example, some time series consist of two or more partial datasets that are stored individually in separate networks. In these cases, the data series are combined. However, in other situations, such as when stations with long records are relocated, extensive statistical analyses should be undertaken to confirm that the merging of the datasets is appropriate. TOAR has made the decision to generally not combine data from different sites but a few exceptions were made and are noted in the TOAR database.</p>
