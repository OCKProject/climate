<p id="P89" class="p">For the TOAR assessment, the following terminology is used when describing trend results: 
 <list list-type="bullet" id="L14" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P90" class="p">a trend result associated with a 
    <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of 0 to 0.05 is a statistically significant trend;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P91" class="p">a trend result associated with a 
    <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of 0.05 to 0.10 is referred to as indicative of a trend;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P92" class="p">a trend result associated with a 
    <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of 0.10 to 0.34 is described as having a weak indication of change; and
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P93" class="p">a trend result associated with a 
    <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of 0.34 to 1 is described as weak or no change.
   </p>
  </list-item>
 </list> The final two categories listed above are shown for informational purposes only, and researchers are strongly cautioned against associating 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values greater than 0.10 with statistical significance.
