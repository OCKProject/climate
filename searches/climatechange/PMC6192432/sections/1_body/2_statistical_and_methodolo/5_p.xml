<p id="P88" class="p">The choice of an alpha of 0.05 as a significance level is arbitrary. TOAR selected this specific level because of the very large number of sites and metrics which were to be tested. Hence, a common point of reference was needed for summarization and comparison purposes, and the 0.05 level is quite common in the literature. However, TOAR is not wedded to a ‘Yes/No’ outcome based on a 0.05 level. TOAR retains the actual calculated 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values in its database. Thus, any researcher who prefers to use either a different level or, indeed, wishes to work with the individual 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> -values for an analysis has the opportunity.
