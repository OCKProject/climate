<p id="P85" class="p">Trends are defined as whether the data exhibit an overall increase, decrease, or no discernible change over the time period of interest. When testing for trends, normally one first proposes a null hypothesis (here, that there is no trend) and a threshold value, called the significance level of the test, which is traditionally denoted as α. The α value is supposed to be fixed in advance and thus part of the study design, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value is a number computed from the data and thus, unknown until it is computed. If the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value is less than or equal to the selected significance level (α), this suggests that the observed data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis is rejected.
