<p id="P94" class="p">An important consideration in selecting tests for assessing trends in the TOAR program was the requirement that the same statistical methods be applied across the thousands of measurement sites in the TOAR database and the various metrics to be analyzed. The large amount of data to be characterized precluded a detailed review of the data from every site/metric combination to determine (1) an appropriate analytical functional form that fit the data and (2) whether a regression approach (either linear or nonlinear) would be appropriate. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall (M-K) test (to test for significant trends) and the Theil-Sen (T-S) estimator (for estimating the magnitude of the trend) were selected. The T-S and M-K methods require (1) no assumptions regarding functional form or statistical distribution for the data and (2) are resistant to outliers, and (3) do not require consideration of whether trends are linear or nonlinear.</p>
