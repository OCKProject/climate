<p id="P107" class="p">TOARâ€™s approach of first testing for the existence of a trend with the M-K test and then estimating the magnitude of the trend with the T-S statistic will generally perform well. However, as suggested above, count data may yield somewhat problematic results for some data sets. For example, if one has counts which are all zero for the vast majority of the beginning or end of the time series and a few monotonically changing counts at the end or beginning, respectively, then the M-K test may yield a statistically significant trend, but the T-S estimator may be zero. It is possible to interpret such a counterintuitive result of a statistically significant trend that is estimated to be zero as indicating evidence of a trend that is very small. On the other hand, one can examine such a case further by using a different or modified estimator of the trend size (
