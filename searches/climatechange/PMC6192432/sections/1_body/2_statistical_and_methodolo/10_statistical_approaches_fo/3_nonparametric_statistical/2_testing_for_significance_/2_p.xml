 <xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mann, 1945</xref>) is utilized to test for a significant trend. Advantages of the M-K test are:

   <p id="P100" class="p">No assumption of any specific functional form for the behavior of the data through time is made. Thus, the M-K test is universally applicable across all sites, seasons, and different continuous summary TOAR exposure metrics (e.g., percentiles, means, and cumulative indices, such as the SOMO10, SOMO35, W126, and AOT40 exposure metrics); and</p>

   <p id="P101" class="p">The M-K test is resistant to the effects of outlying observations. The results are not unduly affected by particularly high or low values that occur during the time series.</p>

 </list> Outliers are fairly common in air quality and other environmental data. Because the M-K nonparametric test targets the median instead of the mean, it is more robust to outliers than parametric tests. The M-K test requires fewer
