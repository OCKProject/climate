<p id="P108" class="p">For examining trends in a time series that contains seasonality (e.g., winter, spring, summer, and fall; warm season/cold season), the seasonal Kendall test and its associated modified T-S estimator can be applied (
 <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hirsch et al., 1982</xref>). Both approaches are modifications of the M-K test and the T-S estimator described earlier. To test for trend in individual seasons, the M-K and T-S methods can be used to yield results for each season. To account for seasonality, while testing for overall trend through the entire time period, the seasonal Kendall test can be used. For each season, one calculates the desired metric. Using the seasonal metric, comparisons are made within each season across the time period of interest and then the results are appropriately combined to provide one trend test and magnitude estimate over the entire time period. An advantage of using the seasonal Kendall test when seasonality exists is to improve oneâ€™s ability to detect an overall trend through the entire time period.
