It possesses the same attributes described above for the M-K test (i.e., there are no distributional or functional form assumptions and the estimator is resistant to outliers). The Theil-Sen (T-S) estimator, similar to the M-K technique, is also universally applicable. In cases where simple linear regression is appropriate (i.e., assumptions are met), the slope of the regression line and the T-S estimator are asymptotically equivalent.
