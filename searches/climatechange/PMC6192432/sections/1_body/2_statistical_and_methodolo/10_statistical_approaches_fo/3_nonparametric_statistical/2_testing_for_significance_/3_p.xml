<p id="P102" class="p">However, the M-K test, similar to other approaches, can be problematic when using count metrics, such as the number of days during the year equal to or above a specific value. Extensive ties in counts may cause problems. Tables exist for the M-K test in its exact form and an asymptotic version is also available (
 <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollander et al., 2013</xref>). The M-K test explicitly accounts for ties both in the test statistic itself and its variance (and hence the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value). In the presence of ties, the test statistic is calculated to explicitly account for these. The exact version may be applied directly. The asymptotic version requires an adjustment of the variance of the test statistic to account for the tied values.
