<p id="P110" class="p">The parametric linear regression approach for assessing the behavior of the data is familiar, widely known, straightforward to apply, and often used by researchers. The approach is readily available in almost all statistical packages. If the underlying functional form of the model is correct, the overall F test indicates whether some of the (non-intercept) parameters are zero, that is, whether the model has much explanatory power or not given the variability in the data; the coefficient of determination or R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> measures how much explanatory power the model has. The Studentâ€™s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test may be used to evaluate the significance of each individual parameter. However, while the F test and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> can provide some guidance as to the appropriateness of the underlying model, neither a significant F test nor a large R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> can be taken as verification that the underlying model is correct. If the underlying functional form is a straight line, the trend is given by the slope of the regression line. If the underlying functional form is not a straight line, the interpretation of the result using this trend test may be unclear.
