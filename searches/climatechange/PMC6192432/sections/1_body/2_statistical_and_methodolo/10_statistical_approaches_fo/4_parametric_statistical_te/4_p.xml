<p id="P111" class="p">The use of linear regression to assess trends in observed values potentially can be problematic. As indicated above, it is important when applying the technique that the underlying assumptions for linear regression analyses are met. The specific assumptions of most concern are (1) the underlying functional form is appropriate to describe the data and (2) the errors are normally distributed, (3) the errors have constant variance, and (4) the data are independent observations. It is important that diagnostics (e.g., residual analysis, cross validation) be performed to confirm the validity of the methodâ€™s assumptions. When the number of observations is small, the assumption of normally distributed errors with constant variance becomes difficult to confirm. If the underlying data are not normally distributed about the regression line or are not independent, the statistical conclusions reached (i.e., either significant or not) are questionable.</p>
