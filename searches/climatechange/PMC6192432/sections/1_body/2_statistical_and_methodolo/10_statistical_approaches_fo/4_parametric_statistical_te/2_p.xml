<p id="P109" class="p">It is worth clarifying the distinction between a parametric linear regression approach and the underlying functional form of the data. For example, one might propose the following nonlinear functional form: Y = b
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> + b
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> x + b
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Ã— 
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This is a nonlinear function in terms of the predictor variable x, but it is linear in the parameters b
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, b
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, and b
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which are to be estimated. Linear regression could be used to estimate the parameters for this function. The model Y = b
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> x/(b
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + x) is a case of a model which is nonlinear in both the predictor variable and the parameters.
