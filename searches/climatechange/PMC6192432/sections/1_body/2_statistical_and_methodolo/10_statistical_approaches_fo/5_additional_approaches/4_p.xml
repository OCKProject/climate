 <xref rid="R139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Munir et al. (2013)</xref> used a variety of methods including: quantile regression, T-S technique, changepoint analysis, and a generalized additive models approach that combined a smooth function of time with loess. 
 <xref rid="R139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Munir et al. (2013)</xref> illustrate the large number of approaches one may use for characterizing trends. However, several of these techniques are highly dependent on the specific data with which one is dealing. This dictates that the trend analysis must then be “fine-tuned,” potentially on a case-by-case basis. So while one may employ the same general approach for the analysis across all sites, the approach may have to be implemented differently from site to site. Thus, one loses the universal applicability of the M-K and T-S methods adopted for the TOAR analyses.
