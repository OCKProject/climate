<p id="P115" class="p">As indicated above, autocorrelation is a potential concern when conducting trends analyses. While autocorrelation is not generally anticipated to be a concern for trends based on annual metrics, an assessment was undertaken to identify the degree of autocorrelation that may be present in the trends analysis presented in TOAR. Trends computed using the T-S technique described above for 14 TOAR ozone exposure metrics at 196 US and 276 EU sites over the period 2000–2014 for the US and 2000–2013 for the EU were tested for the presence of lag-1 autocorrelation (Kendall’s Tau statistic) using data obtained from the case study (

 <xref rid="S35" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4</xref>. At the 5% significance level, only 4% of the EU sites and 2% of the US sites exhibited autocorrelation statistically significantly different from 0. In addition, only 2% of the EU sites and 0.5% of the US sites had autocorrelation greater than 0.5, and no sites in either region had autocorrelation greater than 0.7. The level of autocorrelation present was fairly consistent across the 14 metrics. Based on this analysis, evidence of worrisome levels of autocorrelation for the annual metrics was not observed over the 15-year period used in TOAR.
