<p id="P114" class="p">As noted in the introduction to this section, TOAR seeks to investigate trends at a very large number of sites across broad geographic areas and for a wide variety of exposure metrics. For these reasons, TOAR is utilizing the M-K and T-S nonparametric techniques. However, if one desires to examine trends in more depth at specific sites, different statistical methods may afford more power and/or allow more detailed analysis. For example, in cases when the data are either Gaussian or can be transformed to be nearly Gaussian (e. g., by taking the logarithm of the data), statistical approaches described by
