<p id="P87" class="p">A second type of error one may make in hypothesis testing is a Type II error (sometimes called a “false negative”). This occurs when the null hypothesis is in fact not true, but one fails to detect this. A Type II error may result for various reasons, and one may wish to collect more data and/or further examine the existing data in more detail in future research investigations. The ability to detect that the data indicate an incompatibility with the null hypothesis when it is not true is known as the “power” of the test procedure (in our case, the ability to find a trend when one does exist). The probability of a Type II error equals (1 – power). It is important to note that the power of a test depends on “how false” the null hypothesis is; for example, a test could have relatively low power and still identify a strong trend, but would need to have relatively high power to identify a slight trend. The power of a test is often a consideration made during the design phase of a scientific study, especially when choosing the sample size. However, the data in TOAR is limited to the time periods for which the monitors were operating, and thus power was not a major consideration.</p>
