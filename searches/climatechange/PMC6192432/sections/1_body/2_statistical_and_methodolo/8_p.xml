<p id="P95" class="p">For focused analyses involving subsets of sites, TOAR recognized that parametric statistical tests, such as linear regression, can be applied if the required assumptions were met. For example, standard linear regression necessitates: (1) a linear model is appropriate to describe the data and (2) the variable is normally distributed, (3) has constant variance, and (4) the data are independent observations. The assumption of constant variance may be inappropriate, especially for ozone data because the inter-annual variability tends to decrease as precursor emissions are reduced and levels approach background levels. Ozone time series, based on less than annual data values, can have significant autocorrelation and ozone metrics are often not normally distributed. Ignoring the above assumptions can lead to an incorrect conclusion about the statistical significance and the associated confidence intervals of the regression parameters, thus resulting in significant uncertainty regarding the conclusions for the trends analyses.</p>
