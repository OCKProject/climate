<p id="P86" class="p">When the null hypothesis is not rejected, this does not prove that it is true. When the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the Type I error rate is at most α. A Type I error (sometimes called a “false positive”) occurs when in fact the null hypothesis is true, but one declares that the data are not compatible with it. The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value resulting from the test provides a quantification of making this type of error. For the TOAR trends analysis, a standard α = 0.05 cutoff has been selected (i.e., the null hypothesis is rejected when 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and not rejected when 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). By itself, the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value does not support reasoning about the verisimilitude of the hypotheses; it is merely a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.
