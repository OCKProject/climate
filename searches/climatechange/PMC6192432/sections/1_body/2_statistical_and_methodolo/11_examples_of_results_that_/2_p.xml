<p id="P117" class="p">Both the parametric and nonparametric approaches assume independent observations and can tolerate missing data within reason. For the purposes of TOAR, when comparing trends on a site-by-site basis, based on its universal applicability, the nonparametric approach is utilized. Assumptions required for using a parametric approach may not be met when assessing trends at each monitoring site, with the result that some sites would have to be rejected. This would result in compromising a comparison of trend patterns across sites. The nonparametric approach would likely apply at any site.</p>
