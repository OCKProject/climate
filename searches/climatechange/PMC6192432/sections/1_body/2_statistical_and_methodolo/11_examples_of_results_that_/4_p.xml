<p id="P119" class="p">For the Harwell site, data from 1984â€“2013 were tested for trend using: (1) the M-K test, and (2) by regressing a straight line through the data with the year as the predictor variable. For the nonparametric approach, the magnitude of the trend was estimated by the T-S estimator and for the parametric test by the slope of the regression line. In addition, 95% confidence intervals for the trend magnitudes were calculated. Over this 30-year time period, there were 27 years of valid data.</p>
