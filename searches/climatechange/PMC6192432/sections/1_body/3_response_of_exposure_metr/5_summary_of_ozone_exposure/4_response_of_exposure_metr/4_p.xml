<p id="P148" class="p">Trends in metrics influenced by both moderate and high hourly levels were consistent with the trend types (Figures 
 <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9b, c, d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10a</xref>). For example, the SOMO35 and 6-month W126 metrics decreased at a majority of Trend Types 3 and 4 sites (decreasing frequency of high hourly ozone levels), with no trend calculated at the other sites. Conversely, at Trend Type 2 sites (decreasing frequency of low hourly ozone levels), these metrics either increased or showed no trend. At Trend Type 1 sites, the opposing changes (i.e., high levels shifting downward and low levels shifting upward) resulted in a greater variety in the trends in these metrics. A small fraction of Trend Type 1a sites had increasing SOMO35 and 6-month W126 values, while a much larger number of these sites experienced decreases in those metrics. The fraction of decreasing trends within Trend Type 1 sites was larger for subcategories that had no trend in the median (1b) or decreasing median values (1c) than for Trend Type 1a sites which experienced increasing median values.
