<p id="P151" class="p">Identifying the influence of emissions changes on trends in various exposure metrics is not necessarily straightforward. The predominant pattern in the case study 
 <bold class="bold">for</bold> the EU and US sites, where substantial reductions in ozone precursor emissions have occurred (

 <xref rid="R201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US EPA, 2014b</xref>), was the shifting of high and low levels toward the center (Trend Type 1) with median concentrations increasing (Trend Type 1a) (

 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>), while in Hong Kong, there have been large reductions in local emissions of both NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and VOC since 1997 (

This highlights the fact that ozone levels are the result of complex chemical and physical atmospheric processes and are impacted by spatially and temporally heterogeneous local, regional, and large-scale emissions changes.
