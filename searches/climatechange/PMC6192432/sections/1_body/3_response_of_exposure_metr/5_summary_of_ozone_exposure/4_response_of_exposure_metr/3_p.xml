<p id="P147" class="p">The shifting concentrations within the distribution at EU and US sites resulted in varying trend patterns for the exposure metrics (i.e., some decreased, while others increased under the same change in ozone concentration distribution) (Figures 
 <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>). These patterns varied across sites. Analysis of the EU and US sites showed that for metrics determined solely by the highest ozone levels (e.g., A4MDA8), decreasing trends were calculated at the majority of sites at which the frequency of high levels decreased, regardless of changes occurring across other parts of the ozone concentration distribution. For example, at 70% of all sites assigned as Trend Type 1a, 1b, 3, or 4, A4MDA8 decreased (
