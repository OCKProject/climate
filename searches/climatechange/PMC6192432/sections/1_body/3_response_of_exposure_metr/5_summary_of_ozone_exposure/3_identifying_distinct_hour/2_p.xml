    <bold class="bold">Trend Type 1:</bold> Both ends of the distribution shift toward the center. (Decreasing frequency of high and low levels).

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P136" class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Trend Type 2:</bold> Low end shifts upward but high end does not change. (Decreasing frequency of low levels; increasing frequency of middle levels).

   <p id="P137" class="p">

  <list-item class="list-item">

    <bold class="bold">Trend Type 4:</bold> Entire distribution shifts downwards (Decreasing frequency of high levels, increasing frequency of low levels).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P139" class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Trend Type 5:</bold> The distribution shifts from the center toward both the high and the low ends of the distribution. (Increasing frequency of high and low levels).

  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P140" class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Trend Type 6:</bold> The middle of the distribution shifts downward but the high end does not change. (Increasing frequency of low levels, decreasing frequency of middle levels).

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P143" class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Trend Type X:</bold> Complex trends that do not fall into any of the categories listed above. It is not possible to categorize portions of the ozone distribution into “low”, “middle”, and “high” for this trend type because the directions of the trends shift more than two times across the distribution.
   </p>
  </list-item>
 </list> For assessing the trend behavior of median concentrations, Trend Type 1 sites (i.e., compression from both ends toward the center) were grouped in the study into three subcategories: (1) “1a” sites had increasing median concentrations; (2) “1b” sites had no trend in the median; and (3) “1c” sites had decreasing median concentrations.
