<p id="P144" class="p">Various shifts in ozone distributions occur as differing emissions changes occur. For example, 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6a</xref> illustrates the shifts that occurred between 1989 and 2013 as a result of emissions reductions in the hourly average ozone levels for the rural Glazebury site. Both ends of the distribution shift toward the center with decreasing frequencies occurring at the high end (55 to 85 ppb) and low end (0 to 10 ppb) of the distribution with increasing frequency of hourly ozone levels between 20 ppb and 45 ppb. This Trend Type 1 site is further designated as Trend Type 1a because the median concentration increased (data not shown for median increase). In contrast, 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6c</xref> illustrates the entire distribution shifting upwards (Trend Type 8) as a result of regional emission increases for a suburban site at Yuen Long, Hong Kong, China between 1995 and 2015.
