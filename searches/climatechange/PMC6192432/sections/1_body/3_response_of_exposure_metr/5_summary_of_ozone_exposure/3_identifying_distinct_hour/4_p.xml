 <xref rid="S1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 1</xref>, this trend type is consistent with behavior expected in regions, such as the EU and US, which have implemented large decreases in regional NO

Because of precursor emission increases in mainland China, some sites in mainland China and Hong Kong exhibited the middle of the distribution shifting upwards but the low end not changing; for other sites in China, the entire distribution shifted upwards. All nine of the Chinese sites characterized in the case study were either Trend Types 7 (increasing frequency of high levels), Trend Type 8 (increasing frequency of high ozone, decreasing frequency of low ozone), or Trend Type X (complex trends that could not be categorized (
