<p id="P153" class="p">Those exposure metrics influenced by similar level ranges tended to have consistent trend patterns (Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S-4</xref>). For example, the 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily maximum 8-h and 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest W90 exposure metrics, which are influenced by the highest hourly levels, exhibited trends in the same direction between 1995 and 2014 at 92% of sites analyzed in the TOAR database; neither of the two metrics exhibited a strong relationship with the annual/seasonal median or mean concentrations. On the other hand, the trends for the 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily maximum 8-h metric and the SOMO10 metric were only in the same direction at 55% of sites. While the 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily maximum 8-h metric is influenced by changes in the higher levels, the SOMO10 metric is influenced by changes occurring across low, moderate, and high levels. In contrast, between 64% and 83% of sites had trends in the same direction for SOMO10 and the various mean and median concentrations. Based on the results summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S-4</xref>, all metrics included in the analysis were then grouped based on the similarity of trend patterns across the TOAR database sites (proportion of sites in agreement â‰¥ 80%). The groups of metrics with similar trends patterns to each other, and dissimilar patterns to metrics in other groups are as follows:
