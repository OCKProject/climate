<p id="P154" class="p">Human health metrics fell into two distinct groups: 
 <list list-type="order" id="L17" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P155" class="p">The 4
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily maximum 8-h during the year (4
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> dma8epa annual), 4
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> W90 (annual), the 4
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> highest daily maximum 8-h during the summer (4
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> dma8epa summer), the number of exceedances of daily maximum 8-h values greater than 70 ppb during the summer (nvgt70 summer), and 3-month running mean (i.e., metrics influenced by higher concentrations).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P156" class="p">SOMO35, SOMO10, and average MDA8epax summer (i.e., metrics influenced by a mixture of low, moderate, and high levels).</p>
  </list-item>
 </list> Thus, for the human health metrics, the analysis using TOAR data between 1995 and 2014 indicates that groups of metrics influenced by similar ranges of ozone levels within a distribution exhibit trending patterns which are generally consistent with those calculated in the case study (Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S-4</xref>).
