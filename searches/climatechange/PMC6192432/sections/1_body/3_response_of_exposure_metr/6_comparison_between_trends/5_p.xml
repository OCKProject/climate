<p id="P157" class="p">Vegetation metrics fell into three distinct groups: 
 <list list-type="order" id="L18" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P158" class="p">3-month AOT40 wheat, 3-month 12-h W126 wheat, 3-month 24-h W126 wheat, and 3-month M12 wheat.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P159" class="p">6-month AOT40 summer, 6-month W126 12-h summer, 6-month W126 24-h summer, 3-month AOT40 rice, 3-month W126 12-h rice, 3-month W126 24-h rice, and 3-month M12 rice.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="P160" class="p">6-month M12 summer, 3-month M12 rice, and mean summer.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list> Because the accumulation period associated with the 3-month period for the vegetation metrics are dependent upon global regions (see 
 <xref rid="S4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2</xref>), no attempt was made to identify the ranges most influencing the individual metrics. For the 6-month metrics, a fixed set of months (April–September NH and October–March SH) was applied for the accumulation period and the ranges were identified. Also note that the 3-month wheat growing season tends to occur earlier in the spring compared to a summer rice growing season in most locations. Therefore, the 3-month rice metrics were more likely to have similar trend patterns to 6-month summer metrics than the 3-month wheat metrics.
