 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> also compares the case study metrics with two metrics that have not been specifically linked to human health or vegetation impacts, but which are often used to characterize ozone trends and to evaluate global models, the annual and summer mean and median hourly ozone concentrations. There are varying levels of agreement between trends in mean and median concentrations versus different metrics relevant to human health and vegetation. Trends in the human health metric impacted by the high end of the distribution bear the least resemblance to trends in the mean and median values with generally less than 50% of sites having trends in the same direction. Of the human health metrics, SOMO10 had the most sites with trends in the same direction as mean and median trends (64%â€“83% of sites). Depending on the metric, between 39% and 81% of sites had trends in the same direction between the vegetation exposure metrics and mean/median ozone concentration metrics, with the best agreements occurring with the M12 vegetation metrics. Overall, trends in the four mean/median metrics were not representative of the trends behavior of most of the human health and vegetation exposure metrics. Therefore, modeling results indicating increases or decreases in mean or median concentrations may not reflect changes in health or vegetation impacts. In addition, median metrics showed less correspondence with the effects metrics than the mean metrics and the annual mean/median metrics showed less correspondence with the various effects metrics than the summer mean/median values. These findings are consistent with those reported by 
 <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lefohn et al. (2017)</xref> that trends in mean or median concentrations did not appear to be well associated with some of the exposure metrics applicable for assessing human health or vegetation effects.

The monthly average concentrations significantly increased for seven of the 12 months, and were never estimated to decrease, while the SOMO35 and the A4MDA8 metrics significantly decreased.
