<p id="P152" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Health</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Vegetation</italic>, the metrics described in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, as well as other metrics (see 
 <xref rid="S4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2</xref>), are used to describe spatial variation and long-term trends over a fixed time period (e.g., 1995–2014 and 2000–2014) across sites globally. Using data from the TOAR database with appropriate data capture as specified by 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Surface Ozone Database</italic>), we investigate whether trend patterns of human health and vegetation metrics associated with changes between 1995 and 2014 for all relevant TOAR sites were consistent with the trend patterns (at the p &lt; 0.05 level) observed in the case study described in 
 <xref rid="S36" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4.1</xref>. Additionally, mean and median concentrations determined on an annual and summer seasonal (April–September NH; October–March SH) basis are included in the comparison. For each site, the trend direction for each metric was identified and compared among all the other exposure metrics. For each pair of metrics, Tables 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S-4</xref> (in Supplemental Material) summarize the proportion of TOAR sites for which the trends in both metrics are in the same direction (i.e., both decreasing, both increasing, or both with no significant change at the p &lt; 0.05 level) between 1995 and 2014. This provided quantitative information on which metrics behaved similarly and which metrics did not.
