<p id="P129" class="p">Hourly ozone levels are used to calculate the magnitude, spatial distribution, and trend for various exposure metrics associated with human health, vegetation, and climate change. Exposure metric trends are associated with changes in the frequency of hourly average levels across an ozone distribution. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="S1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 1</xref>, different metrics used for assessing human health or vegetation risks can have different long-term trends (i.e., different metrics can increase, show no change, or decrease) under identical changes in the ozone concentration distribution over time (
