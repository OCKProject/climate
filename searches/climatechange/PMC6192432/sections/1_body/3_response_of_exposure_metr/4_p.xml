The study focused on assessing how changes in the ozone distribution profile in regions where emissions of ozone precursors have decreased (i.e., US and EU) and increased (China) influenced temporal trends in a set of human health and vegetation exposure metrics similar to those selected for use by TOAR at monitoring sites in these regions. For this purpose, trends in 14 human health and vegetation TOAR exposure metrics were examined at 276 EU, 196 US, 3 Mainland China, and 6 Hong Kong, China sites. We then extend the analysis of
