<p id="P130" class="p">As changes in emissions occur, concentrations within a specific part of a distribution can change at a different rate and/or direction than other parts of the distribution. This could result in different metrics providing different responses to emissions controls. An illustrative example for Glazebury, a rural site in the UK, shows that for a common trend across the hourly ozone concentration distribution (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6a</xref>), both increasing and decreasing statistically significant trends in some exposure metrics at p &lt; 0.05, and no significant trends in others are observed (

In this section, we discuss how several of the exposure metrics applied in TOAR papers (this issue) behave in response to changing ozone distributions over time. Assessment of temporal changes in the ozone distribution and related changes in the metrics described in this section use the Mann Kendall (M-K) and Theil-Sen (T-S) statistics as discussed in
