<p id="P165" class="p">Hourly ozone values are used to calculate the magnitude, spatial distribution, and trend for various exposure metrics associated with human health, vegetation, and climate. Exposure metric trends are associated with changes in the frequency of hourly average concentrations across an ozone distribution. The results described in this paper underline the sensitivity of different metrics to different patterns of change across ozone distributions. For example, metrics which focus on the highest concentrations, such as A4MDA8, are sensitive to the magnitude of changes occurring predominately only at these peak concentrations, and independent of changes occurring across the rest of the ozone concentration distribution. In contrast, other metrics which focus on a wider range of hourly average concentrations (e.g., SOMO35, W126, AOT40, daily 12-h average, and SOMO10) are determined by the relative magnitude of changes occurring in different parts of the ozone distribution. Consequently, changes in the ozone distribution at a site may result in different trends in the different metrics used to assess human health and vegetation. Thus, understanding the relationship between trends in exposure metrics and ozone distribution changes is essential for predicting or evaluating changes in human health and vegetation metrics that result from the drivers of ozone variability, as well as assessing the effectiveness of control strategies.</p>
