<p id="P163" class="p">A key component of the TOAR project is the consistent calculation of a suite of ozone metrics across thousands of monitoring sites across the globe. Human health and vegetation metrics provide information for assessing spatial and temporal variation in ozone relevant to these impacts. In addition, these metrics, calculated at individual sites, provide insight into the physical and chemical processes that determine ozone and its variations on different time-scales. Comparison of metrics calculated at surface sites to modeled ozone levels is one method used to evaluate the performance of global models in predicting tropospheric ozone. However, owing to different scientific evidence underpinning each metric, different policy considerations, or features of ozone variability that are of interest, multiple metrics with varying forms have been defined to assess ozone relevant for human health and vegetation impacts, and for model-measurement comparison purposes. This paper has provided the necessary information to understand the implications of selecting any one of these metrics for assessing spatial and temporal trends in ozone and describes the scientific rationale associated with the derivation of the metrics.</p>
