<p id="P164" class="p">In addition to the consistent calculation of metrics across monitoring sites, a consistent approach was also required to quantify the magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of long-term trends in these metrics. To achieve this, the nonparametric Mann-Kendall (M-K) test was used to identify significant trends and the Theil-Sen (T-S) statistic to estimate the magnitude of the trend TOAR assessed over the specified period. There was no evidence of worrisome levels of autocorrelation for the annual metrics over the 15-year period (2000â€“2014) used in TOAR. In the calculation of the TOAR metrics, and the subsequent determination of trends, all hourly averaged ozone data are used subject to the data capture criteria as indicated in the database descriptive materials. TOAR made the decision to generally not combine data from different sites but a few exceptions were made and are noted in the TOAR database.</p>
