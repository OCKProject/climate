<p id="P38" class="p">Flux-based indices have been shown to better represent the spatial pattern of ozone effects on vegetation across Europe, as compared to the exposure-based AOT40 metric (
 <xref rid="R136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al., 2011a</xref>). Studies have shown that in locations in northern Europe, flux-based metrics can accumulate more ozone during moderate exposures if plant and soil conditions are conducive to ozone uptake than during periods of higher levels that coincide with hot, dry conditions (

 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grantz (2014)</xref> showed that variation in ozone flux explained a substantially greater proportion of variability (82%) in the effective flux (flux adjusted for diel variation in plant sensitivity to ozone) for Pima cotton compared to variation in ozone level (43%). Flux-based metrics involve accumulation above a fixed flux threshold which is included to represent the detoxification capacity of the plant that varies with vegetation type/species (
 <xref rid="R137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al., 2011b</xref>). While it is recognized that detoxification should ideally be represented as a dynamic variable rather than as a fixed threshold, modeling approaches are not yet able to take this dynamic variation into account for exposure-based (e.g., AOT40 or W126) or flux-based metrics. Results reported by 
 <xref rid="R208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al. (2015)</xref> for the diurnal changes of ascorbate, a major detoxification agent in the apoplast and leaf tissues of winter wheat, provide evidence for the dynamic nature of detoxification.
