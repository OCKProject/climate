<p id="P39" class="p">Since the 1950s, ozone injury to vegetation has been investigated by plant pathologists using an epidemio-logical approach. They have used a range of metrics from which they focus on different parts of the ozone concentration distribution to quantify injury and damage effects; these different metrics provide varying relationships between exposure/dose and effects (
 <xref rid="R199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US EPA, 2013</xref>). Epidemiological studies of vegetation have mostly used exposure-based metrics, which center on different parts of the concentration distribution, for deriving information on ozone impacts on vegetation under field conditions (

 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fishman et al., 2010</xref>). As ozone levels typically increase in tandem with increasing water stress (
 <xref rid="R127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Matyssek et al., 2007</xref>), these studies require sophisticated statistical approaches for separating the impacts of ozone from those of co-occurring factors (e.g.,

 <xref rid="R133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). Several studies have also used stomatal flux, which incorporates the effects of environmental variables on the uptake of ozone by the leaves (e.g.,

 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Marco et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sicard et al., 2016b</xref>). Based on stomatal flux, epidemiologically-based critical levels could be considered for the protection of wheat yield (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Marco et al., 2010</xref>) or visible ozone foliar injury on forest trees (
 <xref rid="R170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sicard et al., 2016b</xref>), although this approach has not been adopted by 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLRTAP (2017)</xref>. Furthermore, plant epidemiology has been used to test/validate other metrics (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baumgarten et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, the US 2008 ozone standard explained wheat yield decline better than AOT40-based EU standards (see 
 <xref rid="S20" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3.4</xref>) (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Marco et al., 2010</xref>), although the US standard (i.e., 75 ppb) protected fewer sites than the EU standards. Plant epidemiological studies of deciduous tree growth in Switzerland also correlated ozone flux with decreases in stem and shoot growth, with a critical level comparable to that derived above from exposure experiments (
