<p id="P37" class="p">Flux-based metrics have been developed in Europe to quantify the accumulation of damaging ozone taken up by vegetation through the leaf stomatal pores over a specified time during daylight hours (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Emberson et al., 2000</xref>); 21 flux-based critical levels for different responses have been established (

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLRTAP, 2017</xref>). The magnitude of a flux-based metric is dependent not only on ozone concentration variation, but also on the variation in the meteorological and plant conditions (e.g. phenology, soil moisture, temperature, light) that determine the stomatal conductance, thereby controlling the amount of ozone uptake (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLRTAP, 2017</xref>). The metric includes the partial closing effect of higher levels of ozone on stomatal conductance (

 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), a flux-based metric may accumulate less ozone, even during periods with high hourly ozone levels because plant stomata are partly closed to conserve water.
