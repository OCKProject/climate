<p id="P36" class="p">As indicated above, the US EPA based its recommendation on both controlled vegetation effects experiments and empirical observations. A key empirical observation was a multi-year field study conducted at the San Bernardino National Forest in southern California. In the study, forest health improvements were noted because of substantial reductions of the higher hourly averaged ozone levels. The frequency of mid-level concentrations did not substantially change (

 <xref rid="R203" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US Federal Register, 2015</xref>) recommended exposure indices that (1) accumulate and (2) weight higher hourly average levels more than the “mid-level” values for protecting vegetation from ozone exposure. The US EPA indicated that these exposure indices offered the most appropriate approach for use in developing response functions and comparing studies of ozone effects on vegetation. As part of its rulemaking review process, the US EPA (

The Agency indicated that further research was required to clarify the temporal pattern of detoxification capacity; detoxification did not necessarily follow the same temporal pattern as stomatal conductance (
