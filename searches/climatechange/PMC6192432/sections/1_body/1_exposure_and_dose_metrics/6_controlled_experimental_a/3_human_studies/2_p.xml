<p id="P32" class="p">Clinical laboratory studies of healthy volunteers, as well as those with pulmonary disease exposed to a wide range of ozone concentrations under a variety of experimental conditions, overwhelmingly employed a square-wave (i.e., constant exposure) ozone concentration profile. The main reason was simplicity of maintaining the exposure chamber atmosphere. However, as the atmospheric data across different regions of the world unequivocally show, at most sites a dominant daily ozone concentration profile varies from hour to hour and is not constant. Relatively few human laboratory studies have compared the pulmonary function and other endpoints response between the square-wave and more realistic exposure profiles. All such studies have been performed in the US.</p>
