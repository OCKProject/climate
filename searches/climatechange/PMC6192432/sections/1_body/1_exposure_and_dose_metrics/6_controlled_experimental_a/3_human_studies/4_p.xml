<p id="P34" class="p">In contrast to the controlled human exposure study results, which indicate health impacts (lung function decrements in healthy adults) associated with the higher ozone concentrations, epidemiological results appear to indicate that a wider range of hourly average concentrations are important for assessing effects of ozone on premature mortality and morbidity. 
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bell and Dominici (2008)</xref> were unable to identify an ozone concentration below which no effects were observed for the association between short-term ozone exposure and mortality across 98 US communities. However, there is inconsistent epidemiological evidence on whether all hourly average concentrations play an equally important role in assessing epidemiological human health risks for short-term ozone exposure. 
 <xref rid="R183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stylianou and Nicolich (2009)</xref> reported that no association was evident with mortality for values varying between below 10 and below 45 ppb based on analyses conducted on data from 9 US cities. In addition, no association with mortality was observed below specific concentrations in several other epidemiological studies (e.g.,

 <xref rid="R158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pattenden et al., 2010</xref>). In the most recent analysis of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort, a threshold model with a cutoff at 35 ppb marginally improved association between long-term (i.e., annual daily max 8-h) ozone and respiratory mortality. In its decision to change the human health US National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 ppb to 70 ppb, the US EPA expressed its uncertainty concerning the public health implications associated with changes in relatively low ambient ozone concentrations compared to the higher concentrations (
 <xref rid="R203" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US Federal Register, 2015</xref>). The US EPA, while concluding that reducing the highest ambient ozone concentrations would result in substantial improvements in public health, including reducing the risk of ozone-associated mortality, noted that important uncertainties existed in its epidemiology-based risk estimates (
 <xref rid="R199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US EPA, 2013</xref>). These uncertainties were associated with the heterogeneity in effect estimates between locations, the potential for exposure measurement errors, and uncertainty in the interpretation of the shape of concentration-response functions at lower ozone levels (i.e., equivalent to below 20 ppb) (
