<p id="P46" class="p">The MDA8 exposure metric is an air quality metric used by the US EPA to assess compliance with the NAAQS for ozone to protect human health and vegetation. As a part of the development of the US NAAQS, global chemistry models, using the MDA8 metric, were applied in combination with regional photochemical models to estimate background (
