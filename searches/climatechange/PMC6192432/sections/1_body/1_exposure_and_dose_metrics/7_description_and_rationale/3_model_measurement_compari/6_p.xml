<p id="P49" class="p">In addition to the metrics outlined above, other metrics have been defined, which similarly aim to evaluate the ability of models to represent measured ozone levels. Two alternative sets of metrics have been reported in the literature for global model-measurement comparison specifically related to assessment of long-term changes in baseline ozone (
 <xref rid="R155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parrish et al. 2014</xref>) and on the seasonal cycle of ozone at marine boundary layer sites (MBL) (
 <xref rid="R154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parrish et al. 2016</xref>) (See 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplemental Material</xref> for a more comprehensive description). The first approach calculated polynomial “shape factors” that define long-term trends of seasonally averaged, baseline ozone levels at relatively remote sites from the mid-20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> Century to the present. The metrics produced to compare measured and modeled changes in baseline ozone at northern mid-latitudes are polynomial coefficients, shown in Supplemental Material, 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Table S-2</xref>), which characterize relative (to year 2000) ozone changes over broad regions of northern mid-latitudes. For application of these metrics, see 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Model Performance</italic>). Secondly, Fourier series expansions of monthly average ozone levels at selected sites provide a series of comparison metrics (
 <xref rid="R154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parrish et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Derwent et al., 2016</xref>). This method represented the seasonal cycle at marine boundary layer sites around the globe as the annual average plus two sine function terms – the fundamental (period = 1 year) and second harmonic (period = 1/2 year). 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> illustrates one example. The parameters from this representation of the seasonal cycle provide metrics which have been shown to provide critical tests of the model treatment of some of the physical processes that control tropospheric ozone levels in the MBL (see 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Model Performance</italic>).
