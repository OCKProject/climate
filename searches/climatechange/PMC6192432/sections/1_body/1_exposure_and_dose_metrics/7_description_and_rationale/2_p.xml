<p id="P40" class="p">A summary of the TOAR metrics is provided in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The table provides references to examples of how a specific metric has been used. The description and rationale for the TOAR exposure and dose metrics used for human health and vegetation characterizations are described in detail in 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplemental Material</xref>. An additional key component of TOAR is the assessment of modeled ozone levels, and spatial and temporal variability in ozone levels in the free troposphere from surface, remote sensing, and aircraft-based instruments. These topics are comprehensively discussed in the 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Climate</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TOAR-Model Performance</italic> papers for free tropospheric ozone, and modeled ozone levels, respectively. 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplemental Material</xref> also includes descriptions of those metrics used for global model-measurement comparison, and for free tropospheric ozone characterizations. This section provides a condensed description of the widely-used ozone metrics for assessing impacts associated with human health, vegetation, and climate change, including their focus on different parts of the distribution of hourly average ozone concentrations.
