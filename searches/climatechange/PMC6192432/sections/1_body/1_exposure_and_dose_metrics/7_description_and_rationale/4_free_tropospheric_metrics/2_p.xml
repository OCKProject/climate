<p id="P50" class="p">Multiple sources of data (e.g., ozonesonde, aircraft, lidar, and remote sensing) are used to assess ozone throughout the depth of the troposphere as part of the TOAR project. The purpose of free tropospheric metrics (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) is to characterize temporal and longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitudinal spatial variability in ozone levels throughout the troposphere and provide additional insight into the physical and chemical processes occurring that may affect surface ozone. The metrics associated with characterizing the free troposphere are:

 </list> These metrics are intended for use in global chemical transport and climate model evaluation, trend analyses, climate studies, and studies of large-scale processes, such as long-range transport, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and biomass burning. Note that while global model evaluations often compare metrics such as mean or ozone percentiles, regional photochemical model evaluations generally focus on whether ozone was predicted accurately at the right time and location and thus regional model evaluations look at bias and error in paired hourly or daily ozone levels matched in space and time (
 <xref rid="R176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Simon et al., 2012</xref>). However, this straightforward approach may not fairly evaluate model skill, as modest forecast errors in, say, the time or location of an ozone plume may contribute excessively to the total statistical error, as the forecast is too low where the plume should be, and too high where the model placed it (
 <xref rid="R185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tarasick et al., 2007</xref>). The metrics described in this section aim to provide a general and versatile statistical description of the free tropospheric ozone field, from available measurement sources. All ozone values are in nmol mol
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>, except for the integrated TCO values, which are given in Dobson units (DU). Because the frequency of observations varies over a large range (e.g., from typically 3–4 per month for ozonesonde data to as frequent as daily profiles during campaigns, or multiple daily profiles by commercial aircraft over some airports), the number of observations in each data sample is also provided to allow averages to be weighted, and/or evaluated for representativeness.
