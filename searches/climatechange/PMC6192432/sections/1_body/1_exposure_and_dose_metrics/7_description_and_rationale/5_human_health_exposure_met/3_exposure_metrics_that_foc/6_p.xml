Since the ozone (summer) season varies throughout the globe, the Global Burden of Disease studies used, as the estimate of long-term ozone exposure, the annual maximum of running 3-month average daily maximum 1-h values (

 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brauer et al., 2016</xref>). The TOAR long-term trend results (1995â€“2014) indicate that this human health metric appears to be more associated with the higher hourly concentrations within the distribution than those values associated with the entire distribution (see 
 <xref rid="S35" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 4</xref>). Coupled with this metric, TOAR reports the day of the year on which the 3-month maximum metric reaches its maximum value.
