  <p id="P70" class="p">• The SOMO10 metric is the annual sum of the positive differences between the daily maximum 8-h average ozone value and the cutoff value set at 10 ppb (20 μg/m
   <sup class="sup">3</sup>) calculated for all days in a year. The unit is ppb-day. The 8-h average values are determined as per EU protocols (

The SOMO10 metric is calculated in the same way as SOMO35, but with the lower cutoff value and reflects the epidemiological evidence of associations between short-term ozone exposure and lower ozone levels (
