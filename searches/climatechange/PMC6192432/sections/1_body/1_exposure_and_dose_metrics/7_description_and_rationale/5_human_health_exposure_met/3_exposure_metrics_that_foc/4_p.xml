<p id="P64" class="p">The metrics representing the number of exceedances of daily maximum 1-h values greater than 90, 100, and 120 ppb focus on the high end of the distribution and are used in this assessment as ozone metrics for human health, together with other metrics. In 1979, the US EPA adopted the daily maximum 1-h value of 120 ppb as an air quality standard for ground-level ozone. This 1-h standard was revoked in 2005 by the US EPA, but some areas have continued obligations under this standard (

The daily maximum 1-h value is still used in some other countries as the ozone standard. For example, Japan has been using the daily maximum 1-h value of 60 ppb as an ozone standard (

 <sup class="sup">–3</sup> at 273 K and 101.325 kPa) metrics for both residential and commercial areas (
