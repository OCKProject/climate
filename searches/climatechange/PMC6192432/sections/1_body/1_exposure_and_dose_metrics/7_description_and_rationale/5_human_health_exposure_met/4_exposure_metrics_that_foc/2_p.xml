    <xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">REVIHAAP, 2013</xref>). The ozone value selected as the cutoff was chosen partly due to the more accurate modeled ozone values available above 35 ppb, but also due to the observation of a statistically significant increase in mortality calculated for short-term exposure to ozone values above 25–35 ppb (
