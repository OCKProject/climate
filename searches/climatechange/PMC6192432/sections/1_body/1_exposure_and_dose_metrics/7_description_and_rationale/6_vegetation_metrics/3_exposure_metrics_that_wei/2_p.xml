   <p id="P77" class="p">The W126 exposure index (in units of ppb-hrs) is a non-threshold index that is described as the sigmoidally weighted sum of all hourly ozone values observed during a specified daily and seasonal time window, where each hourly ozone value is given a weight that increases from zero to one with increasing value. The W126 metric is identified by the US EPA for assessing risk to vegetation from ozone exposure (

    <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. For both this metric, as well as the human health (W90) exposure index mentioned previously, the sigmoidal weightings are similar except at the lower levels (compare Figures

In the TOAR program, the W126 exposure index is specified over the following time periods: (a) W126 (3-month, 24-h), (b) W126 (6-month, 24-h), (c) W126 (7-month, 24-h), (d) W126 (12-month, 24-h), (e) W126 (3-month, 12-h (0800–1959h) (monthly periods specified), (f) W126 (6-month, 12-h (0800–1959h) (monthly periods specified), (g) W126 (7-month, 12-h (0800–1959h) (monthly periods specified), and (h) W126 (12-month, and 12-h (for tropical or subtropical moist climate zones) (0800–1959h).

   <p id="P78" class="p">AOT40 is the sum of the difference between the hourly mean ozone value at the top of the canopy and levels above 40 ppb for all daylight hours over a specified time. The unit of the exposure index is ppb h and was originally derived because of a growing understanding that plants responded to accumulated ozone above a threshold rather than a long-term average (
    <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuhrer et al., 1997</xref>). As a threshold, 40 ppb was suggested as being relevant at the time when the contribution of baseline ozone to levels in Europe was thought to be relatively lower than current levels and to clearly separate out the peaks, which are of regional (i.e., European) origin (described in 
    <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLRTAP, 2017</xref>). In recent years, the CLRTAP has adopted the flux-based metric, POD
    <sub class="sub">Y</sub> in preference to AOT40 as this metric has greater biological relevance and is better correlated with field evidence of effects (
    <xref rid="R136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al., 2011a</xref>). The AOT40 is a threshold metric, which at times can be sensitive to small changes near its threshold value (
    <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollaway et al., 2012</xref>). AOT40 is used as the legislative standard in Europe (
    <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Directive 2008/50/EC</xref>), when accumulated over a standard time window (0800–1959 h) and a standard time period (May to July), although other periods are available in TOAR (
    <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplemental Material</xref>). It is also included in 
    <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLRTAP (2017)</xref> for daylight hours with vegetation-specific accumulation periods and timings. In the TOAR program, the AOT40 exposure index is specified over the following time periods: (a) AOT40 (3-month, 12-h (0800–1959h), (monthly periods specified according to crop type and growing season and does not apply to forests)), (b) AOT40 (6-month, 12-h (0800–1959h), (monthly periods specified and applicable to perennial vegetation including forests, grassland and perennial crops)), (c) AOT40 (7-month, 12-h (0800–1959h), (monthly periods specified)), (d) AOT40 (12-month, and 12-h (for tropical or subtropical moist climate zones) (0800–1959h)), (e) AOT40 (3-month, daylight over the period when clear sky radiation &gt;50 W m
    <sup class="sup">–2</sup>), (f) AOT40 (6-month, daylight over the period when clear sky radiation &gt;50 W m
    <sup class="sup">–2</sup>), (g) AOT40 (7-month, daylight over the period when clear sky radiation &gt;50 W m
    <sup class="sup">–2</sup>), (h) AOT40 (3-month, nighttime over the period when clear sky radiation &lt;5 W m
    <sup class="sup">–2</sup>), (i) AOT40 (6-month, nighttime over the period when clear sky radiation &lt;5 W m
    <sup class="sup">–2</sup>), and (j) AOT40 (7-month, nighttime over the period when clear sky radiation &lt;5 W m
    <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). The specific steps associated with calculating the AOT40 are provided in 
    <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplemental Material</xref>. The threshold for daylight versus night is 5 degrees solar elevation angle, which is used as a surrogate for 50 W m –2 (
