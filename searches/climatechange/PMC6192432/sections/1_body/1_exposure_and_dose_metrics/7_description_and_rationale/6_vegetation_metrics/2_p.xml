<p id="P75" class="p">Exposure metrics used in assessing potential impacts on vegetation, similar to human health metrics, focus on different parts of the hourly average concentration distribution. Some of the metrics focus on the relatively higher ozone values, while other metrics focus on a combination of the various parts of the distribution. The Supplemental Material describes the vegetation exposure metrics in detail.

The vegetation metrics are defined by growing season and climate zones (
