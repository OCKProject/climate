<p id="P24" class="p">Evidence from different studies on ozone impacts or policy considerations between regions has resulted in a suite of metrics derived from human health and vegetation experiments, as well as developed for model comparison. Data for calculating various metrics may originate from ground-based monitoring networks, and ozonesonde, aircraft, lidar, and remote sensing (including satellite) measurements using different sampling time scales. The official list of TOAR metrics is described at
