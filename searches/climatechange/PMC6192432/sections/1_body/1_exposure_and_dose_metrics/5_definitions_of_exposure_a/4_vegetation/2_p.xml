<p id="P30" class="p">For assessing the potential for ozone to affect vegetation injury, growth and/or yield, exposure is defined as the integral of the instantaneous level over the period the vegetation is exposed to ozone (commonly expressed in unit of mol m
 <sup class="sup">–3</sup> h or ppm-hrs) (
 <xref rid="R142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Musselman et al., 2006</xref>). Examples of exposure indices are the W126 and AOT40 metrics (see 
 <xref rid="S20" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3.4</xref>). Although not necessarily considered exposure, seasonal average levels (e.g., 12-h daily average values averaged over a specified period) have also been referred to as exposure indices (
 <xref rid="R199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">US EPA, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the ozone dose is determined by first calculating the stomatal flux, which is a temporally dynamic measure of the rate of entry of ozone into the leaf (nmol m
 <sup class="sup">–2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>). Dose is the total amount of ozone that is absorbed into the leaf through the stomata, in units of nmol m
 <sup class="sup">–2</sup>, over a period of time and is calculated by integrating over time the instantaneous stomatal flux (

 <xref rid="R137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al., 2011b</xref>). The flux is accumulated over a species-specific phenological time window and the vegetation-damaging ozone flux is expressed as the Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD
 <sub class="sub">Y</sub>), where Y represents a detoxification threshold below which it is assumed that any ozone molecule absorbed by the leaf will be detoxified (
