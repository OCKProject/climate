 <xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">REVIHAAP, 2013</xref>). However, the strength of association between various exposure metrics, dosimetry, and health response is influenced by the same factors as the acute short-term laboratory studies. In addition, multiple confounding factors, such as temporal and spatial variation in ozone concentration, diverse environmental conditions in various locations and microenvironments, and the prevalence of other risk factors for the health outcome under study may substantially modify the relationship between ozone exposure and the particular health outcome. These factors are in many cases controlled for in the epidemiological models used to derive such associations. The epidemio-logic studies also incorporate lag days into their structure to assess potential health outcomes since specific health outcomes need a certain period of time to develop. Similar to short-term laboratory studies, exposure models may be useful in assessing the overall ozone burden and the severity of health outcomes in a population.
