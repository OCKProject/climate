<p class="p">We next evaluated the attributes to identify those that were considered to confer resilience to climate change. An attribute passed through the climate change filter if the article specifically mentioned an attribute in relation to climate change or climate impacts. For example, if the article discussed how an attribute might confer resilience to climate change or an ecological feature directly affected by climate change such as stream flow or temperature, the attribute was retained in our list of resilience attributes. A total of 45 (out of 51) attributes remained after the climate filter was applied. Attributes eliminated by the climate filter (population (beta) diversity, gamma diversity, food-web complexity, large woody debris, salinity, and historical flow-disturbance regimes) may confer resilience to climate change impacts in some situations, but that was not apparent in the articles evaluated.</p>
