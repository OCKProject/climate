<p class="p">We examined the scientific literature to extract attributes of species or ecosystems that have been reported to confer ecological resilience. Using Web of Knowledge, one of us (BLTP) searched using the following terms: (river* OR stream OR (wetland NOT in title) OR ecosystem OR environment*) AND (restor* OR recov* OR re-creat* OR rehabilitat*) AND (resilienc* OR “ecological integrity”), restricting our search to papers published from 2009–2013. From a total of 915 search results, 232 articles were selected for further examination if the title described a scientific study investigating the resilience of some ecological characteristic(s). Of the 232 articles, 111 were selected for full review based on relevance to the study objectives as inferred from the abstract. Fifty-nine additional articles were gleaned from the selected literature based on best professional judgment of their fit with the goals of this study. These articles were added to the analysis for a total of 170 articles examined in this study (
