<p class="p">We classified the 45 resilience attributes from our review into five categories that roughly equate to ecological scale: (1) individual attributes, (2) population attributes, (3) community attributes, (4) ecosystem attributes, and (5) process attributes. We used best professional judgment to classify each attribute by two criteria that we felt were integral for any restoration project: restoration focus (e.g., is the restoration effort species-specific, habitat-specific, or system-wide focused?) and scale of application (e.g., do restoration actions take place at a population, site, or ecosystem scale?). ‘Restoration focus’ refers to the 
 <italic class="italic">type</italic> of project an attribute is best suited for. For example, a population attribute such as density is likely more suitable for a restoration effort that aims to restore a species, whereas a community attribute such as functional diversity is more applicable to a restoration effort aiming to restore an ecosystem. Some attributes were assigned to more than one category because they are suitable for more than one restoration focus. ‘Scale of Application’ denotes the scale an attribute can be used to describe (e.g., generally population scales for biological attributes, and site or ecosystem scales for environmental attributes). Several attributes were assigned to more than one scale because scale varies depending on environmental context or project type. Our classification does not account for every potential application; consequently, users may need to tune some classifications to meet the needs of particular systems or projects.
