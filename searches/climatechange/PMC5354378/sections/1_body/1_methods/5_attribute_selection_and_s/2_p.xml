<p class="p">To illustrate use of the DST in restoration planning, we created three sample applications. We selected three different restoration efforts focused at different spatial scales to demonstrate (1) how relevant resilience attributes can be identified for a specific project and (2) how the attributes selected will differ according to the type of project. We use the Kissimmee watershed system as an example of restoration at the ecosystem scale, a Pacific salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus</italic> spp.) population as an example of restoration at the population scale, and vulnerable coral species as an example of restoration at the site scale.
