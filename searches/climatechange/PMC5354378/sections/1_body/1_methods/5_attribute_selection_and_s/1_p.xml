 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173812.s002" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>) so that practitioners can identify resilience attributes that are best suited to the focus and spatial scale of a specific restoration plan or project. To create a sub-list of suitable resilience attributes, a practitioner can sort attributes by asking: (1) what is the focus of the restoration project? and (2) what is the spatial scale of the specific needs? The output comprises a sub-set of resilience attributes that are more likely to be relevant to the specific plan or project.
