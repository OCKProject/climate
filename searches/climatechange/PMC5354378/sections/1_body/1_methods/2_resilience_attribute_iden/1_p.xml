<p class="p">Attributes of ecological resilience were selected for further consideration if they were (1) typical of more than one ecosystem or species, (2) distinct from other attributes, and (3) measureable. From the assembled attributes, we created a database in which every attribute from each publication was recorded, along with the source of publication, ecosystem context, metric(s) used to measure or monitor the attribute, and whether the attribute was identified as conferring resistance to or recovery from disturbance. We then grouped the attributes into major categories and combined attributes that were similar to produce a list of 51 resilience attributes classified into five major categories. The resilience attributes that we identified come from a wide-range of ecosystems and range from more general (e.g. energy flows) to more specific (e.g. soil and air carbon balance). Given that our primary purpose in this study was to broadly inform restoration practices under climate change, we elected to retain as many attributes as possible and to broadly define terms to maximize utility to practitioners working across a range of scales and contexts. Practitioners can choose to further refine attributes and definitions based on specific applications.</p>
