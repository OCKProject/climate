<p class="p">There is ongoing debate over the association between biodiversity and its influence on resilience. Not all findings support the insurance hypothesis. For example, in a greenhouse experiment, Lanta et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] found that high species richness and functional diversity provided less resistance against drought stressed conditions than less diverse species assemblages. The same study found no effect of diversity on community resistance under outdoor experimental conditions. Similarly, in a study examining species richness in aquatic food webs, Downing and Leibold [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] found that while respiration rates showed “higher resilience” in species-rich communities, they did not exhibit increased “resistance” to disturbance. In contrast, however, a number of studies have found strong causal linkages between diversity measurements and productivity or stability in a number of terrestrial and aquatic systems [
