<p class="p">Alpha diversity, genetic diversity, and functional diversity were the most frequently cited diversity attributes. Duffy [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>] found that on average, greater species richness increased resource use within trophic levels and accumulation of biomass, and that the variance in these responses was reduced over time. Moreover, diverse communities have a higher chance of including either disturbance-resistant species or species that are able to recover quickly from a variety of perturbations [

Ecosystems or communities with greater functional and response diversity are able to maintain important ecosystem processes that sustain function and result in ‘no net loss’ in productivity, often referred to as the insurance hypothesis [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref147" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>] tested the hypothesis that a greater number of species should enhance the probability that a system will provide a more “consistent level of performance” using microbes. They found that the greater number of species per functional group led to more consistent biomass and density measures within the replicated microbial microcosms. Genetic diversity can provide this benefit by increasing the critical response diversity among populations and can help maintain ecosystem function [
