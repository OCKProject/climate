<p class="p">Connectivity was found to enhance capacity for self-organization and recovery at multiple scales, including interactions between species at community and population scales and connectivity of habitat types and ecosystems throughout both space and time [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] observed how flooding events increasing invertebrate populations by connect intermittent pools in rivers and provided for colonization and dispersed young individuals. In coral reef systems, Olds et al. [
