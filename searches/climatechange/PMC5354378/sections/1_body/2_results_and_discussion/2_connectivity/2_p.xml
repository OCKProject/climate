 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. Many species, such as Pacific salmon, rely on movement throughout the system, including the mainstem, tributaries, floodplain habitats, and deltas. Removal of anthropogenic barriers to migration can help increase resilience of aquatic biota to climate change impacts such as changing flow regimes [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Ecosystem connectivity is also critical to help regulate essential abiotic and biotic processes such as flow, temperature, water quality, aquatic and terrestrial interactions and food webs.
