<p class="p">The purpose of our analysis is to assist restoration practitioners in identifying appropriate resilience attributes to measure and monitor within particular systems. The focus of the management or restoration action (species, habitat, or system) is the first basis for categorizing the resilience attributes, because the overarching goal or motivation of restoration will dictate objective setting and monitoring design. The scale at which the attributes should be measured is the second basis for selecting attributes. Together these two criteria can help distill a subset of potential resilience attributes that are suitable for a specific restoration action or monitoring efforts. The attributes and their associated metrics should be part of an adaptive management framework to be evaluated for their usefulness in conferring resilience to climate change.</p>
