<p class="p">Spatial and temporal variability in habitats have been observed to maintain higher levels of biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], and thus contribute to ecosystem resilience. A study conducted by Oliver and others [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] found landscape structure, including increased heterogeneity within habitat patches, to influence resilience of populations to extreme climatic events. A landscape with a more heterogeneous habitat structure was more likely to contain refuge microclimates to support survival of the ringlet butterfly, and greater heterogeneity among habitat patches increased the likelihood of harboring species more resilient to extreme events [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Within river systems, spatiotemporal variability in flow and temperature regimes was found to regulate suitable habitat and maintain flexible species adaptations [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Milner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>] showed that maintaining habitat heterogeneity can maximize resilience of aquatic species to altered flow regimes associated with climate change. While habitat variability generally increases diversity at various scales, it also serves as a useful “measure of resilience to impending climate change” [
