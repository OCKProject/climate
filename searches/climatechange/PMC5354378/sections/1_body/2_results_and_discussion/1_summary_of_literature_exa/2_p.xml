<p class="p">More than half (33 of 45) of the resilience attributes were defined as equivalent to resistance (to perturbation), and many others (42 of 45) used resilience synonymously with recovery, or as an outcome of recovery (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Across all studies, 30 of the 45 attributes were used in both ways (i.e., some studies considered resilience to mean recovery, while others considered it to mean resistance). However, only a few sources explicitly considered resilience to include both concepts: that of resistance, or the ability of an ecosystem or community to persist through a disturbance, and that of recovery, or rate at which a system or community returns to its functional state.
