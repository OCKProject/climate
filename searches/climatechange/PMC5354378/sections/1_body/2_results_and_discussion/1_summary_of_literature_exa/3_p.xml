 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] used a literature review to distill a list of 19 ‘resilience indicators’ that ‘conferred resilience’ within coral reef systems. In a study by McClanahan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>], a group of 50 scientists ranked and scored an existing list of ‘resilience factors’ also in coral reef systems. Bernhardt and Leslie [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>] conducted a comprehensive study exploring sources of resilience to climate change within coastal marine ecosystems and found three important ecological themes for conferring resilience: connectivity, biological diversity, and adaptability. Our review, which included the aforementioned studies, also found these three ecological themes to be widely cited in the literature, but to these we add habitat variability and condition, presence of refugia or support areas, and natural disturbance history as commonly-cited themes. We discuss these themes and the influence of human pressures on resilience in the following sections.
