 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173812.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Rocky shore, wetland, and grassland ecosystems were less commonly cited (4 citations each). While our search terms did include river or stream habitats, as that was our intended focus originally, we also include broader terms of ‘ecosystem’ or ‘environment’ which resulted in a diverse representation of habitat types. The number of times an individual attribute was cited varied from 1–20. By attribute type, ecosystem attributes were most frequently cited (
