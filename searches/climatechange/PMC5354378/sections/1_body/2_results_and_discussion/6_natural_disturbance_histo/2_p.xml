<p class="p">Natural disturbance can influence biophysical characteristics of ecosystems and populations. For example, the size of a disturbed area can influence recovery rates because it effects how close it is to undisturbed neighboring areas that can provide material for re-colonization [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. Some authors characterized entire ecosystems that are subject to high levels of natural disturbance as resilient. The hypothesis is that systems with high levels of disturbance have adapted with species and or processes that support quick recovery or resist complete change altogether [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>]. In addition to disturbance, the magnitude and duration of an event proved to be an important attribute conferring resilience within many different systems. A number of studies found disturbance intensity to affect the degree of recovery [
