A substantial proportion of the literature identified presence of natural disturbance as an important determinant for recovery rates, creation of alternate trajectories, and building biological capacity to adapt to or resist change. Systems that are naturally subjected to a variety of disturbances contain biota that have evolved life history traits favoring adaptability or flexibility [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] determined that bacterioplankton communities in a lake ecosystem had developed a number of life history attributes (e.g., high growth rates, phenotypic flexibility) that favored adaptation and explained their high resilience to natural pulses of Microcystis blooms. Within marine ecosystems, Neubauer et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] confirmed that a history of moderate exploitation within fisheries populations can increase their rate of recovery.
