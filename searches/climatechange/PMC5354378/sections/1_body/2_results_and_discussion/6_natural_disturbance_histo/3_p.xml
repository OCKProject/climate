<p class="p">The effects of increased disturbance due to climate change do pose serious unknowns for resilience. For example, holm oak woodlands are historically highly resilient to fire frequencies of about 50 year intervals, but if the frequency of fire increases in response to climate change the system may not exhibit the same degree of resilience [
