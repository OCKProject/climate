<p class="p">Attributes classified by restoration focus and scale of measurement roughly sorted according to attribute category (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For example, individual and population attributes (e.g., dispersal potential or genetic diversity) tended to be associated with species-specific restoration actions and with resilience at the population scale. Community attributes generally described the structure and diversity of ecosystems (e.g., community structure, functional diversity, or species diversity), and therefore were most often associated with site-specific or system-wide restoration. Roughly half of the ecosystem attributes (e.g., habitat area and condition, or refuge areas) were associated with all three restoration foci and at all three spatial scales. Process attributes were most diverse with respect to both focus and scale.
