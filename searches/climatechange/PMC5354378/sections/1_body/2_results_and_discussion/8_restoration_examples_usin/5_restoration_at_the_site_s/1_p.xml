Restoration activities that focus on specific sites or habitats are more common for sessile species where the focus is either on restoring habitat for a species or ‘seeding’ a species to initiate recovery at a site and many of the following attributes resulting from the DST depend on having available habitat. Individual, ecosystem, and process categories are represented in the list of suitable resilience attributes for this type of restoration (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Individual attributes speak to a species’ ability to persist in an area. Ecosystem attributes are focused on habitat characteristics that may affect a species such as its condition, structure, or whether there are support areas present. Key process attributes that may affect habitat or species include structural legacies, disturbance, or degree of exposure to human pressures. Evidence suggests that conservation of sessile organisms such as coral reefs is most effective when an Ecosystem-based Management approach is taken. To address the many threats to coral reefs the creation of an MPA is coupled with land-based management to help reduce pollution sources [
