<p class="p">We illustrate how resilience metrics might be used in conservation or management of species or ecosystems with three applied examples. In each example, we focus on how practitioners might select a sub-set of resilience attributes for characterizing or monitoring resilience of species or ecosystems using the DST. The examples we selected—restoration of the Kissimmee River system in Florida, recovery of an endangered salmon population, and coral species restoration—demonstrate how a sub-set of resilience attributes and metrics differ depending on biological and management contexts and the scale at which attributes are measured.</p>
