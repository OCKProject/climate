<p class="p">The Kissimmee River once meandered for more than 100 miles through central Florida; connecting diverse habitats and supporting a thriving wetland ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>]. Restoration of the Kissimmee River System in Florida began two decades ago, and aims to reverse channelization and draining of wetlands to restore floodplain connectivity and restore ecosystem processes important to both the Kissimmee River and the Everglades ecosystem to which it drains. Based on the restoration focus (system) and scale (ecosystem) of the restoration effort, we derived 23 resilience attributes from the DST (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) that are appropriate as restoration or monitoring variables. These attributes represent the community, ecosystem, and process categories (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Key resilience attributes within the community category are assemblage, diversity, redundancy, and connectivity. Not surprisingly, resilience attributes related to connectivity appear in all three major categories, as connectivity is a cornerstone of efforts to restore the Kissimmee River and Everglades ecosystem. In this case, each connectivity attribute increases resilience by allowing organisms and materials to move freely as suitable habitats shift in location. Within the ecosystem category, habitat area, condition, and variability are attributes that can support diversity or redundancy. Restoration efforts have largely focused on increasing natural habitat area and condition, including water quality and flow which are key metrics used to evaluate restoration success [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>]. The remaining attributes in the process category tend to be features that also influence habitat condition and therefore support the community attributes. For example, energy flows is a broad and somewhat non-descript metric, however in this ecological context managers or restoration practitioners could consider (and already are) measuring how much water, sediment, and/or nutrients move between refuge areas.
