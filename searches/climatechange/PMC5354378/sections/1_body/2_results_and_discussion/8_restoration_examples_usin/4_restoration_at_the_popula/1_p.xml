<p class="p">Recovery of salmon populations listed under the Endangered Species Act focuses on achieving several important targets, including adequate population size, population growth rate, spatial distribution, and diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref186" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Each of these targets are listed in the resilience attributesâ€™ population category and they are monitored and population performance is assessed using these criteria every 5 years. That is, these resilience attributes were selected to characterize recovery of salmon populations in part because they indicate both recovery of number of fish and recovery of population attributes that buffer populations against environmental change. This comports well with our DST, which suggests that relevant resilience attributes include genetic diversity and connectivity as well as growth, size, abundance, and life history flexibility in individuals and populations (
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In addition, delisting criteria consider whether habitat factors contributing to listing have been abated. Consequently, various habitat-related resilience attributes are also appropriate for consideration in restoration planning or monitoring recovery. Habitat characteristics such as area, condition, and presence of refugia play an important role in the restoration of endangered populations and are often key components for the recovery of any species listed under the ESA. In addition to the metrics that align with current actions regarding salmon restoration, the DST provides several novel metrics that could be used to increase the resilience of endangered salmon populations to climate change, or to monitor changes in resilience among salmon populations.
