<p class="p">A number of resilience attributes we identified, including exposure to human pressures, were often discussed in context of cumulative impacts. This is an important consideration when measuring resilience in locations subject to multiple human stressors. The ability of ecosystems and their components to maintain resilience in the face of climate change when those systems are already under stress from cumulative human-generated impacts is a topic of evident concern in the literature [
