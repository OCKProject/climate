<p class="p">We found contradictory evidence regarding the effects of human pressures on resilience. A number of studies reported that isolation from human pressures or reduced exposure to anthropogenic stressors increased resilience within their systems [

 <italic class="italic">if</italic> there is a positive co-tolerance between non-climatic disturbance and climatic impacts among coral species, then some degree of human-caused degradation may “increase the abundance of disturbance-tolerant species within a community and thus the ability of an ecosystem to resist impacts of climatic disturbance”. However, reduced abundance of less tolerant species (and increased proportions of disturbance-tolerant species) can also be considered an indicator of ecosystem degradation, at least in some contexts [
