<p class="p">From our examination of recent ecological literature, we have extracted three key points that may be helpful in integrating resilience metrics into restoration plans. First, if made an explicit planning objective, as opposed to a component of existing objectives, resilience may be a way to improve restoration projects as a whole [

By planning and monitoring for resilience, we are forced to identify sources of adaptive capacity within restored and natural ecosystems and to define actions that foster resilience. Second, considering the restoration focus and scale of a plan or project is essential in choosing appropriate resilience metrics to inform restoration efforts. In the face of climate change, restoration approaches that promote natural sources of resilience are more likely to be successful than those that focus on creating optimal steady states. Third, certain ecological attributes, such as diversity and connectivity, are more commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems. Even so, we identified numerous additional metrics that could potentially be useful for resilience planning.
