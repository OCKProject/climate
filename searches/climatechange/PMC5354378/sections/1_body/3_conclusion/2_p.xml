<p class="p">The need to understand the dynamic nature of ecological systems, especially in the context of climate change, is crucial for successful restoration work. Improving our understanding of how certain ecological attributes confer resilience will help practitioners develop best practices for successful restoration in a changing climate. Past trends in climate and streamflow, for example, make it clear that stationarity of the physical environment is no longer a valid assumption in restoration planning. Moreover, we should not assume continuous directional change in ecosystems, as climate cycles and other sources of natural variability drive annual or decadal variation in habitats and species. Hence, assumptions made about response and recovery trajectories can greatly influence restoration planning decisions. By monitoring the response and recovery of a variety of species and ecosystems, we can better understand which attributes most contribute to ecological resilience to climate change.</p>
