<p class="p">Ecological restoration proceeds in the face of advancing climate change, which imposes additional stress on systems already under pressure from human use and this can undermine the long-term success of restoration efforts [
 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. To address this concern, many have suggested a shift away from static restoration end points and towards dynamic and adaptive ecological process goals [

 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Evidence suggests that climate change impacts on populations and communities are increasingly considered in the development of management priorities and adaptation plans. For example, recent climate change studies have utilized trait-based vulnerability assessments to identify both potential impacts and inherent natural sources of climate-change resilience for individual species [
