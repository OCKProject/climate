 <xref rid="pone.0173812.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] that defines resilience as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize in ways that retain essentially the same functions, structures, identities, and feedbacks. This definition includes two important mechanisms of resilience, namely resistance to change and recovery from change.
