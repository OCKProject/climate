<p class="p">To understand how resilience attributes can be integrated into restoration practices under climate change, we first distilled common attributes of ecological resilience from the published literature. We then applied a ‘climate filter’ to identify attributes likely to confer resilience under changing climate conditions. We further classified these attributes according to their ecological scale of application. We provide three examples to illustrate how practitioners can select resilience attributes that are appropriate for specific management applications. Finally, we outline general strategies for integrating resilience into restoration planning and monitoring in a changing climate.</p>
