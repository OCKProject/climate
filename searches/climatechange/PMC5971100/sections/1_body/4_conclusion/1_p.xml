<p class="p">Protecting species today and then wait for climate change to unfold to improve the existing protected areas network is more expensive than planning both networks together (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hannah et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, identifying the congruencies between planning protected areas network under current and futures conditions, as we have done here, means to anticipate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and provide more cost-effective solutions for its conservation. Currently, the network of protected areas within the Atlantic Forest does not adequately protect its endemic birds, because only a handful of the counties selected in the planned protected areas network currently have a protected area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Here we provide a flexible portfolio of priority counties for decision makers. The establishment of new protected areas in the counties selected in this study may greatly improve the effectiveness of the current network of protected areas within the Atlantic Forest, both right now and in under future climate change conditions. However, because the Atlantic Forest have lost most of its forest cover, a similar analysis should be done focusing on prioritizing areas for forest restoration, in order to achieve a comprehensive strategy for biodiversity conservation in the Atlantic Forest under climate change.
