<p class="p">The sensitivity analyses, halving or increasing twofold the conservation targets (i.e., a percentage of species’ environmentally suitable area to be protected), greatly decreased or increased the number of counties in the solution, respectively, but did not substantially change the number of species represented in the proposed protected area network (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). For the standard conservation strategy, for example, when halving the conservation target, there is an overlap of 126 counties between the solution under current and future conditions, representing 127 species. When doubling the conservation target, the number of counties needed to represent 137 species exploded to 1,629 overlapping counties, and almost the entire Atlantic Forest is selected (
