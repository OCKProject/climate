<p class="p">The final solutions (i.e., the most cost-effective) represented 150 and 147 of the 151 target species in the current and the future scenarios, respectively, independent of the use of county or regional level strategy (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Under future conditions, however, 484 and 553 counties were required to achieve that representativeness under the county and regional level strategies, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Such increase in the number of counties selected in the future for the regional level strategy resulted in a higher overlap of the most cost-effective solutions for current and future scenarios, from 256 (under the county level strategy) to 284. Notwithstanding, both county and regional level strategies, presented approximately 50% overlap in the most cost-effective solution for &gt;83% of all species in current and future conditions (
