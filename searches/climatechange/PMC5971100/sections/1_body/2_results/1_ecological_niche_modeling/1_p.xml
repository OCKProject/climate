 <italic class="italic">Touit melanonotus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Myrmotherula urosticta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Phylloscartes beckeri</italic>), who’s consensus models had to be built from only two algorithms, because the other models were discarded for having poor performance measures. The models predicted a contraction of environmentally suitable areas under 2050 climate change conditions for the vast majority of the 151 species modeled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For 148 species, we predicted an average contraction ∼29,500 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in environmentally suitable areas, representing 52% of the current area. Some species had particularly worrisome predictions, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Amazona brasiliensis</italic>, with &lt;50 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of environmentally suitable area by 2050 (99.1% area loss), or 
 <italic class="italic">Myrmotherula urosticta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Leptodon forbesi</italic> with only 2 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (99.7% and 99.9% area loss, respectively). We also predicted that 
 <italic class="italic">Touit melanonotus</italic> will lose 100% of suitable areas, but this result must be interpreted with caution, as the species’ final ensemble model was built with only two algorithms. For three species (
 <italic class="italic">Thripophaga macroura, Amazona rhodocorytha, Polioptila lactea</italic>), however, models predict an expansion of environmentally suitable area, with an average increase of 4,100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> or 10% greater than the current area (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" class="xref">Table S1</xref> for species’ current and future environmentally suitable area).
