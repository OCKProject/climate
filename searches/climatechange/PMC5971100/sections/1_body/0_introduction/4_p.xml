<p class="p">In order for planned protected areas network to remain effective under climate change conditions, it is paramount to minimizing conflict between conservation and development at the level at which top-down decision-making occurs (e.g., at the federal, state or county administrative spheres). This kind of approach is timely for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the five hottest hotspots in the world, i.e., areas with exceptionally high biodiversity and that have lost &gt;85% of its original forest cover (
