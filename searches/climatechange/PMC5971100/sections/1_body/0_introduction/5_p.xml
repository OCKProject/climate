<p class="p">Here we quantify the effectiveness of planning protected areas network in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, both currently and under future climate change conditions. We selected the most cost-effective areas to establish protected areas network, focusing on maximizing conservation of 151 endemic bird species, while minimizing co-occurrence with densely populated areas at different scales (county versus regional level strategy). Our key question is whether planning protected areas network under current conditions is similar as planning it under future climate conditions.</p>
