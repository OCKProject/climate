<p class="p">To minimize the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity, protected areas networks must be planned considering not only current species’ distribution, but also its response to climate change (

 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hannah et al., 2007</xref>). An obvious solution for this problem is combining ecological niche modeling and systematic conservation planning in light of climate change scenarios. However, few studies have combined both approaches to propose effective protected areas network under climate change (

 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loyola et al., 2013</xref>). These studies have all focused on biological targets in protected area planning, finding a varying degree of species’ loss from selected reserves under future climatic conditions. To make cost-effective decisions, however, studies must recognize and take into account the conflict between biodiversity conservation and socio-economic demands (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pinto &amp; Grelle, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crouzeilles et al., 2015</xref>). In areas that have similarly high biodiversity, the ones that are less economically attractive or densely populated should be prioritized for protection, minimizing conflict and increasing protected areas’ likelihood of success in achieving its conservation goals.
