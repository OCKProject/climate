<p class="p">Studies have shown that planning protected areas network under current environmental conditions tends to become less effective in species representation under future climatic change conditions (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hannah et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loyola et al., 2013</xref>). Our study shows a slightly more optimistic situation, with &gt;50% overlap in selected counties and representation of &gt;80% of the targeted species.
