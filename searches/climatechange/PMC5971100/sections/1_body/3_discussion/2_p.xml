<p class="p">Another reason for the relatively large overlap in selected counties under current and future conditions is the use of counties as planning units. Most systematic conservation planning studies use regular units, such as squares or hexagons, which are typically smaller than Brazilian counties (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loyola et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crouzeilles et al., 2015</xref> in the Atlantic Forest). The larger the planning unit, the greater the chance of overlap, but using counties as planning units is essential if the results are to be of any direct use for decision makers (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pinto &amp; Grelle, 2011</xref>). This broad planning unit can also help to guide, with high return on investment, the allocation of limited resources for conservation. Our proposed protected areas network requires only ca. 10% of the Atlantic Forest counties for the most cost-effective solutions in both scenarios (overlap of current and future solutions). That is, the creation of new protected areas in these 10% of Atlantic Forest counties should be meaningful both right now and in the future.
