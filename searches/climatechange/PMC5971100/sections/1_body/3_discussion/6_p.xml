<p class="p">Our results are intended to help decision makers by identifying priority counties in which conservation efforts should focus, i.e., those counties that combine high biodiversity with relatively low population density and, additionally, have relatively more area covered by forest and less covered by protected areas. After this first needed step, the specific location where each protected area should be created is contingent on other criteria and needs, such as landscape connectivity (e.g.,

The administrative level in which decision occurs (county, state or federal) may directly affect the effectiveness of protected areas network. Our networks were quite similar numerically at either county or regional level strategies, meaning that our results are useful at different administrative spheres. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (MMA in Portuguese acronym) and the State Institute of the Environment (INEA/RJ in Portuguese acronym) have encouraged the creation of new protected areas under the concept of “protected areas mosaic”, i.e., juxtaposed protected areas, with the same or different management regimes, that should be managed as a single unit (

The results of our regional level strategy provide clear guidelines for the establishment of new protected areas under the “mosaic” concept. Most states within the Atlantic Forest, however, have yet to join the mosaic concept, and for those, the results of our county level strategy can be more relevant.
