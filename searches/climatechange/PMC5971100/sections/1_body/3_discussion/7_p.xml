<p class="p">Our study provides practical guidance on where to establish new protected areas in order to better protect Atlantic Forest birds against ongoing climate change. However, in biomes that have lost most of their original forest cover (such as the Atlantic Forest), the strategy of conserving the remaining forest under protected areas is often insufficient to safeguard biodiversity, precisely because of the scarcity of forest left. In such cases the protected area strategy must be complemented by restoration efforts in order to increase total available habitat and habitat connectivity, which are essential for species’ persistence under climate change conditions (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Travis, 2003</xref>). Our proposed protected area network adequately represented &gt;80% of the endemic birds of the Atlantic Forest, but the remaining 20% will likely require conservation strategies outside protected areas, such as forest restoration, in order to persist in the long-term. The enforcement of existing legislation represents a great opportunity for forest restoration. In the Atlantic Forest, the Brazilian Forest Code (Law no. 12.651) requires landowners to maintain a forest buffer of at last 30 m along rivers, and large landowners to maintain at least 20% of their property’s area as forest. The fact that only ca. 12% of the Atlantic Forest is actually forested (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>) demonstrates that most landowners do not comply with the law. The enforcement of the Forest Code could, therefore, be an important trigger for forest restoration in the Atlantic Forest. Still, there are many restoration initiatives in the Atlantic Forest outside the scope of Forest Code enforcement. The “Pact for the Restoration of the Atlantic Forest”, for example, congregates hundreds of independent restoration projects within the Atlantic Forest, with the goal of restoring 15 million hectares of forest by 2020 (

Currently, however, there is no study identifying priority areas for restoration within the Atlantic Forest. There is a clear need, therefore, for prioritization schemes for restoration in the Atlantic Forest that take into account not only conventional socio-economic and environmental constraints, but also the restoration potential for biodiversity conservation under future climate conditions.
