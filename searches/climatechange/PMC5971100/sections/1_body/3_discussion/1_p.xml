<p class="p">We found a large contraction in the environmentally suitable area for Atlantic Forest endemic birds under climate change scenarios, which is in agreement with previous studies in the biome with birds or other taxa (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Souza et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lemes, Melo &amp; Loyola, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loyola et al., 2014</xref>). The greatest losses in the future are predicted in the highly biodiverse central portion of the Atlantic Forest (Serra do Mar and Interior Forest subregions) (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jenkins et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in a more localized area in the north (Pernambuco sub-region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>)), where only 1% to 7% of forest remnants are within protected areas (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>). At the same time, we predicted a moderate increase in species richness towards the south, as a result of shifting distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), which was also reported for other taxa (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Colombo &amp; Joly, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ferro et al, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lemes, Melo &amp; Loyola, 2014</xref>). The general pattern of greater species richness in the central portion of the Atlantic Forest, however, persists under the future conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), which is one of the reasons why our study shows &gt;50% overlap in selected counties under current and future conditions.
