<p class="p">There are only two systematic conservation planning studies considering future climate change in the Atlantic Forest, despite the biome’s prominent biodiversity role (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loyola et al. (2013)</xref> with amphibians and 
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zwiener et al. (2017)</xref> with plants). Unfortunately, however, they do not provide results at the county level, hindering a comparison with our study and a direct guidance to policy makers. From an applied perspective, our recommendations for endemic birds in the Atlantic Forest are: (i) planning protected areas network currently can be useful to substantially represent species under climate change scenarios for 2050; (ii) counties that appear in the most cost-effective solution under current and future conditions can be considered “no regret” areas to invest in the establishment of protected areas; and (iii) decision can occurs at different administrative spheres as we found quite similar numerical solutions using either a county or regional level strategy.
