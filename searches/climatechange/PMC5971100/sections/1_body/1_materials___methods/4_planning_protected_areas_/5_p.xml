<p class="p">We used the Atlantic Forest counties as the unity of analysis (i.e., planning units) as they are the smallest geopolitical unit considered for top-down decision-making in Brazil (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pinto &amp; Grelle, 2011</xref>). We built a species’ presence-absence matrix per county under current and future conditions based on species’ environmentally suitable area. We included different conservation targets (i.e., a percentage of species’ environmentally suitable area to be protected) for each species based on species’ sensitivity to habitat disturbance, conservation status and size of environmentally suitable area. We used 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parker, Stotz &amp; Fitzpatrick (1996)</xref>’s classification of species sensitivity to disturbance, targeting to include at least 30% of the environmentally suitable area for species with “high” sensitivity, 15% for species with “medium” sensitivity and 0% for species with “low” sensitivity. At the same time, we used the classification of the International Union for Nature Conservation Red List (

Finally, we also established targets based on the size of environmentally suitable area, based on 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IUCN (2001)</xref>’s criteria for threat using the size of species’ area of occupancy as guidance, therefore targeting to include at least 30% species with environmentally suitable area &lt;10 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 20% for species with environmentally suitable area &lt;500 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 10% for species with &lt;2.000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 0% for species with &gt;2.000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Thus, species with higher sensitivity, threat and/or little environmentally suitable area received higher representation targets. We performed a sensitivity analyses, halving or increasing twofold these values, to evaluate the robustness of our results.
