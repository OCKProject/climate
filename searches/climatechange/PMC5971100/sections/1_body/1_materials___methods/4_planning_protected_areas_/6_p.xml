<p class="p">We used human population density per county as a surrogate for socio-economic development in our cost data. Thus, we considered counties with denser populations a lesser priority in selecting areas for the establishment of protected areas. For the future scenario, we assumed that the human population density among counties will maintain the same relative ranking, i.e.,Â the counties that currently have the lowest population densities might increase population in the future, but so will other counties and, therefore, will continue having the lowest densities in the future. We used the 2013 estimates of human population size per county from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (
