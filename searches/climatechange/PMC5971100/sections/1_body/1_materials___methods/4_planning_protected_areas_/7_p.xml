<p class="p">We run MARXAN 100 times with 10 million iterations for each climatic conditions (current and future), planning both ignoring and considering the use of the “boundary length modifier” (BLM). Planning ignoring BLM is the standard procedure, where counties are selected independently, providing county level solutions that are readily applicable at the smallest administrative unit for decision making in Brazil (hereafter, called “county level strategy”). The planning considering BLM aggregates counties in the final solution, and therefore, provides regional level solutions that are applicable at the state or federal administrative spheres (hereafter, called regional level strategy). We found the best BLM for each scenario by plotting total cost versus total edge of selected planning units (BLM) for the best solutions, and identifying BLM values where total cost and total edge intersects. We did so by running MARXAN with different BLM values, from 0 to 1 in installments of 0.1 (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Table S2</xref> for the list of counties and their attributes), including only protected areas that can be considered as I-IV category in the IUCN, i.e., Brazilian strictly protected areas and Private Natural Heritage Reserve (
