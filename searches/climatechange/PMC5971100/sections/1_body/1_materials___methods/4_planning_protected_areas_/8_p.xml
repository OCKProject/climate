<p class="p">We calculated the percentage of overlap between the selected planning units in the most cost-effective solution under current and future conditions, planning both county and regional level strategies, in order to quantify the differences in the configuration between these protected area networks. Additionally, we calculated, for each species, the amount of environmentally suitable area protected under the solution of both scenarios (i.e.,Â the overlapped of the most cost-effective solutions). All maps were processed in geographic coordinate system with Datum WGS84 and then converted to the World Cylindrical Equal projection. All analyses were carried out in ArcGIS 10.4 or R 2.12 (
