<p class="p">We combined two methodological approaches, ecological niche modeling and systematic conservation planning, to identify the most cost-effective areas to establish protected areas network in under current and future climatic conditions. Ecological niche models were based on five algorithms under a business-as-usual climate change scenario. We combined algorithms in a final binary ensemble model and then clipped to the Atlantic Forest remnants, excluding areas where forest no longer exists. We maximized the representation and persistence of each endemic bird species considering different conservation targets and minimized co-occurrence with densely populated areas, using counties as the unit of analysis. We also simulated the impact of more clumped solutions. Finally, we contrasted the most cost-effective solution in under each climatic condition, current and future, using both county and regional level strategy (i.e.,Â simulating more clumped solutions).</p>
