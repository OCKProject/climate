Given that we used five algorithms, we only selected areas as “environmentally suitable” if they were selected by at least three algorithms. Ensemble models were then clipped to the Atlantic Forest remnants, excluding areas where forest no longer exists. This procedure produced the final maps of “environmentally suitable areas” for each the species, under current and future climatic conditions, used in the systematic conservation planning analysis (see below). Therefore, environmentally suitable areas have both adequate climate and adequate forest cover for species’ occurrence, assuming that in the future the forest cover will remain nearly the same. We did not use a prediction of forest configuration in 2050 because: (i) there is not one available at a meaningful spatial resolution (e.g., the Land-Use Harmonization Project has a resolution of 50 km used by
