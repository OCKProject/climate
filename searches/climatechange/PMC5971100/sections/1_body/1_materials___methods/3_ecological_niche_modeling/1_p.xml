We compiled occurrence records using original data, the literature and major ornithological collections in the region (Rio de Janeiro National Museum in Rio de Janeiro State, University of São Paulo Museum in São Paulo State, Professor Melo Leitão Bilogy Museum in Espírito Santo State, Capão da Imbuia National Museum in Paraná State, and João Moogen Zoology Museum at Minas Gerais State). We looked at every occurrence record, excluding those with will-defined geographic coordinates or that clearly fell outside species range as defined by the scientific literature, the digital maps of BirdLife International, or the range description provided the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. We also used the IUCN Red List to exclude species extinct in the wild. We excluded species with fewer than 12 reliable occurrences. At the end, we had 151 bird species and 5,482 unique occurrence records (see
