 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Souza et al., 2011</xref>): (i) temperature seasonality, (ii) precipitation seasonality, (iii) maximum temperature of the warmest month, (iv) minimum temperature of the coldest month, (v) precipitation of the wettest month, and (vi) precipitation of the driest month. The data had 2.5 arc-minute spatial resolution, which is compatible with the spatial error associated with occurrence recordâ€™s location. Data under current conditions were downloaded from WorldClim (
