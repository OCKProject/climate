<p class="p">We evaluated model’s performance through True Skill Statistics (TSS) on model’s binary outputs (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Allouche, Tsoar &amp; Kadmon, 2006</xref>) based on a confusion matrix built with true presence and pseudo-absence data. TSS values vary between −1 and +1, where negative values indicate very poor performance and a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit. For presence data we randomly selected 25% of species’ occurrence records. For pseudo-absence we randomly selected points outside species’ distribution, using IUCN /BirdLife International distribution maps (
