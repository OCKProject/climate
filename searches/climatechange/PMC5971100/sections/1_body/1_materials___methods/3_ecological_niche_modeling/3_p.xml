<p class="p">Ecological niche models were built in the ModEco software (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>), using five modeling algorithms, which are complementary in terms of mathematical structure and input data requirements. We included two environmental envelope algorithms that use presence-only data (environmental envelope–BIOCLIM and environmental distance –DOMAIN), two statistical algorithms that use presence versus absence data (SVM and logistic regression –GLM) and one machine learning algorithms that uses presence versus background data (MAXENT). We used background points randomly distributed in the extent of analysis (ModEco’ default) totaling five times the number of species’ occurrence records used to calibrate the model. The algorithms also differed in the output format: BIOCLIM and DOMAIN generate binary projections (suitable versus unsuitable), while the remaining algorithms generate continuous projections of environmental suitability. For the latter, we used a threshold value, maximizing the number of occurrence records under suitable areas (sensitivity) and pseudo-absences under unsuitable areas (specificity). This threshold method produces final models with higher performance measures, and is not affected by the type of input data use, being suitable for all algorithms used (
