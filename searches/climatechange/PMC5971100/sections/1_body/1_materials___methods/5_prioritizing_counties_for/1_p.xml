<p class="p">An ad hoc prioritization scheme was created for counties that were selected in the most cost-effective solution under both current and future scenarios. The scheme places higher priority on the counties that were particularly relevant for the final proposed protected area network, had the greatest amount of forest remnant, and lowest area already within protected areas. A Priority Score was created, therefore, by summing the forest remnants (%) within the county + area outside protected areas (%) within the county + county’s irreplacebility under current conditions (%) + county’s irreplacebility under future conditions (%), where the irreplacebility is the number of times the county was selected in the 100 MARXAN runs. The maximum possible Priority Score, therefore, is 400 (i.e., 100% forest cover, 100% unprotected area, 100% irreplacebility under current condition and 100% irreplacebility under future conditions).</p>
