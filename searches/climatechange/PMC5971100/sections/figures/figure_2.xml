  <title class="title">Selected counties for the establishment of protected areas networks for the conservation of Atlantic Forest endemic birds.</title>
  <p class="p">We used a county level strategy (ignoring the boundary length modifier - BLM) and regional level strategy (considering BLM). Black counties already have protected areas and were always included in the final solution; red counties were selected in both current and future scenarios, while green counties were selected in either current or future scenario. (A) Selected counties using a county level strategy under current climatic conditions. (B) Selected counties using a county level strategy under future climatic conditions. (C) Selected counties using a regional level strategy under current climatic conditions. (D) Selected counties using a regional level strategy under future climatic conditions.</p>
