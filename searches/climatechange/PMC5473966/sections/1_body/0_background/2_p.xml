<p class="p">An important effect of plant diversity is the buffering of environmental fluctuations, such as droughts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Under standard management conditions it remains to be investigated whether plant species richness dampens the effect of fluctuations on ecosystem functioning. Central European plant communities are exposed to high inter-annual variability in weather conditions, and different responses of its members will lead to portfolio effects, buffering the effects of environmental variability at the community level [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. The general existence of these mechanisms is beyond dispute, but its relevance for managed systems with at least a moderate number of species (&gt;2) can be questioned. Such systems include most grasslands (used as pastures or meadows) and non-plantation forests.
