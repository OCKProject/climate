<p class="p">The scientific consensus is unambiguous about the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. It is largely based on experiments along species richness gradients from one to tens of species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. There is much less experimental attention being paid to the effect of species richness in managed systems, where the range of diversity is different. In managed temperate grasslands, species richness can be as low as five vascular plant species/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and as high as 60 species/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Thus, the gradient in grassland species richness generally does not cover the very low end of diversity, which is included in the design of many experimental studies (Cedar Creek: 1–16: [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]; Biodepth: 1–16: [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]; Jena: 1–60: [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]). Since at very low species richness diversity matters most [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>], it is not clear whether results from experimental grasslands directly translate into long-term managed grasslands, that is, whether such controlled experiments have high external validity.
