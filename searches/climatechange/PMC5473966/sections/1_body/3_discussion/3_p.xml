<p class="p">Across the three regions, species richness gradients differed greatly (e.g. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Extensive sheep grazing led to high species richness in the Swabian Alp, while the rich, organic soils of Schorfheide-Chorin had very low species richness. This is in line with analyses by Socher et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>], who report differential effects of management for the three exploratories: the diversity-promoting effect of grazing in the Swabian Alp is inverted into a negative effect in Schorfheide-Chorin. This may be due to grazing disturbance being at a small spatial scale, increasing dominance of tall species in fertile grasslands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. We cannot resolve whether it is the regional conditions that led to different correlations between species richness and buffering ability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) or because this finding is due to the fact that the regions cover different ranges along the species-richness gradient. To address this question, the experiment could be repeated on sites specifically selected to yield similar richness ranges in all three regions.
