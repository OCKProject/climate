<p class="p">The design of the Biodiversity Exploratories uses land-use types to realise a gradient in plant species richness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Indeed, land-use type is a significant predictor for species richness of our plots. For this experiment, however, we replicated the same land-use type five times in an attempt to break this strong association. As a consequence, land-use type did not emerge as particularly strong predictor of species richness (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), opening the way for analysing the additional effect of plant species richness (polyserial correlation between land-use type and species richness is only ρ = 0.325). We believe that through our experimental design and the apparently sufficiently sensitive measurements we would have been able to detect a consistent ecologically relevant buffering effect of plant species richness against imposed drought and warming, if it existed.
