<p class="p">This surprising but rather important finding has apparently not been noticed before, and it demands an explanation that is beyond the scope of this study. An obvious explanation would be that natural droughts are much more severe than manipulations. The EVENT experiment is more radical by simulating a 100-year drought, and indeed finds evidence for buffering of community productivity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>], but not in other responses (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]). More studies need to create such strong manipulations to test whether this is a general pattern. As another potential explanation, we speculate that drought manipulations, typically by rain-out roofs, may have treatment artefacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] that limit the ability of the vegetation to compensate for loss in productivity of dominant species. For example, even if roof artefacts did not affect community biomass, they altered light quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] and may prevent light-demanding drought-tolerant species to gain from competitive release.
