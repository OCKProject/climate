<p class="p">The interplay of species richness and drought, in particular, has received substantial attention in the ecological literature. To better place our results in this context, we differentiate studies along two axes: (1) whether drought was manipulated or occurred naturally, and (2) whether diversity gradients were experimentally established or naturally realised in the field. In all of the resulting four combinations one can evaluate the importance of biodiversity for buffering drought effects. Our experiment (drought manipulation in natural diversity setting) showed little ability to buffer drought. This is consistent with most similarly designed studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], which report no biodiversity effect on drought resistance. Furthermore, also drought manipulations in experimental diversity gradients, which are rare, largely found no buffering effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], but see Kreyling et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] for some buffering, discussed below). This is in contrast to all findings from measurements taken under naturally occurring drought. Plant species richness reduced the effect of drought under natural diversity settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] as well as under experimental biodiversity gradients (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Natural diversity settings have the distinct disadvantage of confounding richness and environment. If the process that leads to higher plant diversity is also responsible for the system’s resistance to drought, one cannot attribute resistance exclusively to plant diversity (see e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]). The predominant lack of buffering in drought manipulations even on experimental diversity gradients suggests a different reason, however.
