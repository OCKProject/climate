<p class="p">Beier et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] point out that the approach we have chosen (“multi-factor application”) inevitably confounds the effects of spring warming and summer drought. This is the price to pay for manipulating a specific scenario (or as they call it, the “inevitable dilemma”). The way spring warming and summer drought act in combination is not obvious. Spring warming led to an earlier growth, which could lead to an overall earlier season of unchanged length. We found no visual evidence for shifted phenology in summer, and also Reyes-Fox et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] showed that warming extends, rather than moves, the season in a temperate grassland. Our experiment is insufficient to tease apart the different effects, and how they may accumulate over time.
