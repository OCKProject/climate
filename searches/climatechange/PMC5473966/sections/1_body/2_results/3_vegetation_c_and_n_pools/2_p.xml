<p class="p">The pattern for nitrogen in vegetation was similar to that of vegetation carbon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> right). The above-ground treatment manipulation effect was even more pronounced here (F
 <sub class="sub">1, 74</sub> = 7.43, P &lt; 0.01), as was the difference between Schorfheide-Chorin and the other two exploratories. The significant land use-exploratory interaction (F
 <sub class="sub">4, 74</sub> = 4.50, P &lt; 0.01) was here due to mown pastures having higher N-pools in SA and HD, but lower in SC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> left). In line with responses of functional group biomass, the C- and N-pools of legumes was most affected by our manipulations, followed by that of herbs.
