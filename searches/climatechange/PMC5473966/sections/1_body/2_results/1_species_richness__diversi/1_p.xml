 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S3). The significant differences of species richness between the land-use types are due to the varying quantity and richness of herbs and, to a lesser degree, legumes, while grass richness was very similar (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The pastures in the Swabian Alp, in contrast to the pastures of the two other exploratories, are located in semi-dry grassland and are grazed by sheep, which explains the noticeable higher number of species (32 species compared to only 17 and 11 in Hainich-Dün and Schorfheide-Chorin, respectively; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Legumes were particularly scarce in the Schorfheide-Chorin, both in terms of species numbers and their biomass (see below). Neither total nor functional-group species richness differed significantly between treatments (all P &gt; 0.085; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), but by the end of the experiment (2010), Shannon diversity showed a consistent and significantly positive treatment effect (F

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S3). Finally, plant species composition differed substantially among exploratories and land uses, but was affected only very mildly by our treatments (Additional file
