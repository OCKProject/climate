<p class="p">Despite the effect of the treatment on C and N in plant biomass, we could not detect changes in the pool of soil C and N due to temperature or rainfall manipulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, P &gt; 0.48). As for the vegetation C- and N-pools, there were significant differences between the exploratories and land-use types (F
 <sub class="sub">4, 75</sub> = 3.07, P &lt; 0.05 and F
 <sub class="sub">4, 73</sub> = 2.83, P &lt; 0.05, respectively), with Schorfheide-Chorin having highest C- and N-levels. The interaction is due to higher C- and N-values for meadows relative to (mown) pastures in SA and HD, but the opposite pattern in Schorfheide-Chorin.
