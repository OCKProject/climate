<p class="p">Although our design was sensitive enough to detect a significant three-way interaction in summer, and effects of species richness in spring (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), LRR showed no interpretable pattern with respect to species richness. The positive effect of species richness for the response to earlier spring was very small and contributed less than 4% to the variance in the data (F
 <sub class="sub">1, 26</sub> = 4.77, P &lt; 0.05). Responses to combined spring and summer manipulations display huge scatter in LRR. Depending on land-use type and exploratory, positive, negative and no correlations with species richness were observed, accompanied by a significant four-way interaction (F
