<p class="p">Across and within the exploratories, plant species richness varies with land-use type, but with substantial scatter (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. We thus first analyse the correlation between exploratories, land-use type and plant community composition and richness in our study plots. Results largely refer to spring 2010 and summer 2009, i.e. after two periods of the respective treatment, to represent the largest effects in our study.
