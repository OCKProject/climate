<p class="p">Open-top chambers increased spring temperature by 0.5 °C in the air and 0.35 °C in the soil (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), in a period of absolute temperatures between −5 °C at night and 15–20 °C during the day (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). In summer, rain shelters had a warming effect (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) as pronounced as in spring, but at much higher overall temperatures (12–35 °C). Soil moisture during this period was reduced under the shelter by 8–20%vol, with substantial differences between exploratories (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). In all sites, soil moisture in the control plots averaged to 30–40%vol, but soil moisture was most affected by drought treatment in the Swabian Alp. Both at the SA and HD sites, the drought treatment presumably resulted in soil water potential being more negative than the permanent wilting point (PWP, at pF = 4.2) as estimated from soil texture data with high clay and silt contents. At the SC site with sandy soils, however, soil water potential was still above the PWP (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1).
