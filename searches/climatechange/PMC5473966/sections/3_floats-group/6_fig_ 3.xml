  <p class="p">Contrast in biomass between treatment and control at the end of a temperature (spring 2010 
   <italic class="italic">left</italic>) and rainfall (summer 2009 
   <italic class="italic">right</italic>) manipulation period, expressed as log-response ratio. 
   <italic class="italic">Negative values</italic> indicate a negative treatment effect, 0 indicates no difference between treatment and control. 
   <italic class="italic">Lines types</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">letters</italic> refer to land-use types (where “b” stands for “both”, i.e. “mown pastures”), 
   <italic class="italic">grey shades</italic> represent the three different exploratories. In spring, species richness had a small but significant effect, while neither land-use type, exploratory nor their interaction(s) were significant. In summer, the three-way interaction of species richness, land-use type and exploratory was significant (see Table
