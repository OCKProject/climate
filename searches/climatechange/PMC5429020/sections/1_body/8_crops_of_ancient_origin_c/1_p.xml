<p class="p">The papers in this special issue describe, consider and discuss the state of our developing knowledge and understanding of important topics within legume biology, as well as identifying key areas where more knowledge is urgently needed such as an absence of comprehensive genomic information and intensive breeding efforts. In the past 50 years, global cereal production has almost tripled while pulse production has only increased by about 60% (

 </xref>). Legume crops are also currently under-used compared to cereals in cropping systems, and yet intercropping and rotation of grain legumes with cereals or other crops have many benefits, such as enhanced crop yield, increased nitrogen-use efficiency, and reduced occurrence of plant disease. Intercropping with grain legumes is now seen as a vital mechanism for vertical intensification, as well as facilitating an increase in biodiversity and creating a more diverse landscape for animals and insects.
