 <bold class="bold">Global food security requires a major re-focusing of plant sciences, crop improvement and production agronomy towards grain legumes (pulse crops) over coming decades, with intensive research and development to identify climate-resilient species and cultivars with improved grain characteristics. Labs contributing to this special issue have undertaken research and breeding to improve pulse crops, together with innovative production agronomy which contributes to the sustainability of cropping systems. The reviews and research together form an invaluable resource for the research community and policymakers.</bold>
