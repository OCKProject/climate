<p class="p">Recognizing that increasing the global production of grain legumes has the potential to provide a sustainable solution to food and protein security, significant efforts are currently being made to increase genomic resources and apply innovative breeding techniques to improve the yield and nutritional quality of legume crops, together with enhanced resilience to climate change. Production agronomy and crop rotation approaches could also be intensified to address the associated economic and environmental challenges. The papers presented in this special issue bear testimony to the urgent need for the intensification of basic and applied research into grain legumes, which will form a cornerstone of future food and nutritional security and a global web of biodiversity.</p>
