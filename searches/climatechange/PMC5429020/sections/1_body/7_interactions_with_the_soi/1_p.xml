<p class="p">Many unique functions of grain legumes take place beneath the soil. These plants offer the promise of more sustainable use of nitrogen fertilizers in crop systems through their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiotic root nodules. The process of bacteroid infection in legume roots that culminates in the formation of symbiotic nodules is summarized by

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2017)
 </xref>. Highlighting the differences between root-hair entry and intercellular invasion, these authors explore the evolution of this process. Nodulation, however, is suppressed in soils replete with nitrogen, for example in farms with a long history of nitrogen fertilization. This phenomenon is explored by
