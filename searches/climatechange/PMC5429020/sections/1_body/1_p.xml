The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) facilitated the International Year of Pulses in 2016, focusing on the contribution of pulses to production and dietary diversity to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. This initiative was introduced with objectives to (i) promote the value and utilization of pulses throughout the food system, (ii) raise awareness of their benefits, (iii) foster enhanced research, (iv) advocate for better utilization of pulses in crop rotations, and (v) address challenges in trade. The FAO initiative was also linked to a growing recognition of the contribution of pulses to critical targets under Sustainable Development Goal 2, particularly regarding food access, malnutrition and smallholder incomes, as well as sustainable and resilient agriculture.
