<p class="p">As a protein staple in the diet of many of the world’s poorest, pulses are nature’s gemstones because they are protein packed and nutritious. However, in many cases relatively little is known about the biology of the plethora of ‘orphan’ legume crops that contribute to human and animal diets. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cullis and Kunert (2017)</xref> address the issue of under-utilized grain legumes directly, highlighting the considerable but neglected opportunities to advance grain legume agriculture by developing the existing germplasm. They recognize the investments of organizations such as the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), International Centre for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and the Kirkhouse Trust, as well as initiatives to develop genomic data for these underused crops, but emphasize the need for crop physiology and production agronomy to support future crop development.
