  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2017)

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pang 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Moreover, the crucial importance of root trait variability and its role in facilitating stress tolerance in chickpea is reported (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). The depletion of soil water often brings the added burden of salt stress to limit plant productivity. The beneficial effects of sucrose infusion at the reproductive stage of chickpea production are presented by 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Khan 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref>, together with evidence that salt-stressed chickpea is carbon-limited. Hence the provision of sucrose improves vegetative and reproductive growth in plants exposed to high salt (
