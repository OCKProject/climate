<p class="p">The mechanisms that underpin drought tolerance in legumes are further elaborated by an innovative analysis of root xylem plasticity and its role in improving water use efficiency in soybean plants subjected to water stress (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). These and other papers in this special issue not only highlight the importance of the availability of water to legume agriculture, but also demonstrate that both drought and flooding pose some of the greatest challenges to the current and future production of soybean and forage legumes (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Striker and Colmer, 2017</xref>). Their comprehensive analysis of the diversity in forage legumes for flooding tolerance will be of particular interest to those engaged in gaining a deeper understanding of the physiology of stress tolerance in legumes. It is also of practical use to researchers and agronomists engaged in forage plantings in flood-prone areas. Data for some key species are provided, in which current eco-physiological understanding is limited. Suggestions for future areas of priority in this important group of plants include the central importance of understanding anoxia tolerance in roots, the ability to maintain symbiotic nitrogen fixation during waterlogging in the field, and identification of traits conferring the ability to recover after water levels subside (
