<p class="p">Some grain legume species such as faba bean and pigeon pea (
 <italic class="italic">Cajanus cajan</italic>) have outcrossing characteristics, and rely to some extent on pollination by animal vectors. Climate change and associated extreme weather events such as sudden episodes of high temperature during flowering can affect reproductive success in grain legumes, directly through physiological damage and indirectly by affecting plant–pollinator interaction. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bishop 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> report a substantial increase in the level of outcrossing in faba bean by insect pollinators following heat stress both in a controlled environment and under field conditions. Stoddard, in his Insight article, discusses the ability of faba bean to self-pollinate in the absence of bee activity, known as ‘autofertility’ (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stoddard, 2017</xref>). It is argued that reliance on wild pollinators is a risky strategy when also affected by climate change. Thus the provision of honey bees may be increasingly required for adequate pollination of faba bean crops in the future.
