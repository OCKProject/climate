<p class="p">We used the RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, which represent low-range and high-range of GHG emissions, respectively. Projected changes in ocean conditions (including sea surface temperature, sea bottom temperature, salinity, sea surface advection, sea ice extent, oxygen concentration and net primary productivity) were based on outputs from three different Earth System Models (ESM). Multimodel ensemble is used to mitigate model uncertainty. These ESMs include Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model 2 M (GFDL ESM2M), IPSL-CM5-MR and MPI-ESM for the RCP 8.5 scenario. For RCP 2.6 scenario, the projected changes were based on outputs from the GFDL ESM2M as the outputs from the model are in the middle of the range projected by the different ESM models applied. The outputs were re-gridded onto a 0.5° x 0.5° grid map of the world ocean using the nearest neighbour method, which interpolated the missing values by selecting the value of the nearest point, while missing values in some grid cells were interpolated using bilinear interpolation.</p>
