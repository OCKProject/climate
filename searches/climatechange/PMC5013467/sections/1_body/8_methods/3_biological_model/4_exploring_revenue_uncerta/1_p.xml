<p class="p">For testing revenue uncertainties, we projected the price trends of different groups of marine species based on the available price information under different projected price scenarios

For example, the price of low value food fish decreases by a total of 26% in the “faster aquaculture expansion” scenario in 2050 over 2000 level. Then, the future fisheries revenues were estimated using the projected price and the sensitivity of the results to this assumption is evaluated.
