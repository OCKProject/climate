<p class="p">Based on the projections of the future distribution of the selected marine species and the projected primary production from the outputs of the ESMs, we estimated the annual MCP using the published empirical model of Cheung

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. MCP is a proxy of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), calculated from MCP = F

 <sub class="sub">MSY</sub> is the fishing mortality required to achieve MSY (approximated from F
 <sub class="sub">MSY</sub> = natural mortality rate of the stock) while B is the projected biomass in each year and spatial cell. In each grid cell, the projected catch of the species was allocated to each fishing country based on cell-based data from the reconstructed catch database of the

Then, total MCP of EEZ was calculated from the sum of catch in cells belonging to that EEZ. The projected percentage changes in MCP in each EEZ in the 2050 s relative to current status (2000 s) was calculated using the total MCP of all species caught in a given EEZ.
