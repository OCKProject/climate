 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Warmer temperatures may also lead to decreases in maximum body sizes of marine fishes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. The combined effects of the predicted distributional shift and changes in ocean productivity under climate change are expected to lead to changes in species composition
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> and hence global redistribution of maximum catch potential (MCP), with projected increases in MCP in high latitudinal regions and decreases in the tropics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. These changes have large implications for people who depend on fish for food and income, and thus the contribution of fisheries to the global economy
