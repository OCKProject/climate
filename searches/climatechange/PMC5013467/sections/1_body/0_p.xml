<p class="p">Global marine fisheries landings are estimated officially at between 80 and 85 million t a year since 1990, with corresponding mean annual gross revenues fluctuating around USD 100 billion annually
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Accounting for unreported catches, a recent study estimated the likely “true” annual global catch to be about 130 million t
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. The global fisheries sector supports the livelihoods of between 660 to 820 million people, directly or indirectly, which is about 10–12% of the world’s population

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. However, along with other non-climatic drivers such as changes in markets, demographics and overexploitation, climate change is considered to be a major challenge that will significantly shape the future of global fisheries. Several studies suggest that these non-climatic stresses and changes in management regimes may have a greater impact on fisheries than climate change in the short term
