<p class="p">We explored the effects of different seafood price scenarios on future fisheries MRP. These price scenarios are based on the results from the United Nations’ “Fish to 2020” study

We compare projected MRP from these alternative price scenarios to the “constant price” scenario in which price stays the same as that in the 2000 s. The “constant price” scenario is different from the “baseline” price scenario as price under the latter changes from 8.7% to 34.8% in the seafood commodity groups (
