<p class="p">The impacts on MRP vary for EEZs in different latitudes and ocean basins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Impacts in the tropics (10°N to 10°S) are projected to be the highest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), with MCP and MRP decreasing by 38% and 33%, respectively, under RCP 8.5. Overall, 80% of EEZs worldwide (224 EEZs) are projected to show a decline in MCP. The greatest positive impact is projected to be in the Arctic Ocean (regions higher than 75°N) and the Northern Atlantic (regions higher than 70°N) where MRP are projected to increase by 71% and greater than 100%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). This latitudinal gradient is consistent with the findings from previous studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The greatest negative impact is in tropical regions with EEZs in the central Pacific and central Atlantic being affected the most (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The EEZs with the largest average decrease in MCP mostly belong to small island countries, for example, Tuvalu (−79%) and Kiribati (−70%). These countries are highly dependent on fisheries for food and livelihoods and their marine ecosystems are more vulnerable to climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. In contrast, EEZs in higher latitude regions are projected to see positive impacts. In the Arctic, the melting of sea ice may create new fishing opportunities for non-Arctic fishing countries but may pose a threat to the Arctic countries’ fleets, which are currently primarily artisanal and subsistence-based.
