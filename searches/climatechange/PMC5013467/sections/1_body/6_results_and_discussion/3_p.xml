<p class="p">Our projected MRP are most sensitive (i.e., with the largest changes from the “constant price” scenario) to the “slower aquaculture expansion” scenario (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). The increase in prices of all seafood commodity groups leads to an increase in MRP of approximately 7 and 9 times the magnitude of change under the “constant price” scenario for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Since global seafood production from aquaculture has been increasing at an annual rate of 8% in the past decade
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, this scenario is unlikely to happen based on the current trend
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Only two of six price scenarios show negative impact on MRP (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Under the “faster aquaculture expansion” scenario, seafood prices of two seafood commodity groups (i.e., low value food fish and mollusks) decrease, resulting in a more substantial decrease (more than double) in fisheries MRP relative to the “constant prices” scenario (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The majority of price scenarios assume an increase in price by 7 to 57% by 2050 relative to 2000 that compensate for the projected decrease in catch and result in a projected increase in fisheries MRP even under the high emission scenario (11–40%).
