<p class="p">The global scope of this study requires us to make various assumptions in representing the dynamics of fisheries revenues and biophysical systems â€“ these assumptions can incrementally be relaxed in future studies. Fishing revenues can capture the impact on both the fishing industry and the consumer but only partially because fishing costs are not included. To fully examine the economic impacts of climate change on society through fisheries, future studies should include analysis of both consumer and producer surpluses. Actual catch might not necessarily equal the MCP because catch may be influenced by other factors such as fisheries management, fishing cost and subsides. Since this study focuses on the effect of climate change on catch and revenue potential, we keep the fishing effort constant (at a level to achieve Maximum Sustainable Yield), thus, catch is solely driven by biology.</p>
