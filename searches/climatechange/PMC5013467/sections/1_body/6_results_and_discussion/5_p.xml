<p class="p">Some countries are projected to see a large increase in MCP in their own EEZs but the percentage increase in their projected MRP is relatively low (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For instance, Greenland EEZ is expected to see a 58% increase in total MCP by the 2050 s, however, the expected increase in MRP is only 19% under the RCP 8.5 scenario. This is due to the decline in MCP of some highly economically valuable species, such as Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) (−70%) and European plaice (
 <italic class="italic">Pleuronectes platessa</italic>) (−64%). Thus, total MRP from fisheries are not only dependent on the amount of catch, but also on catch composition and associated prices. Also, Greenland fisheries do not only fish in its own EEZ, but also along Canada’s east coast. As a result, the projected positive impact of the MCP in a country’s EEZ may not necessarily mean a positive impact on its economy, and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>. For the top 10 countries with the highest catch volume from Distant Water Fishing (DWF), their overall MCP outside their own EEZs is projected to decrease by 1.5% (±2.4%) from the current status quo even though their domestic MCP is projected to increase by 4.8% (±0.4%) under the RCP 8.5 scenario. In terms of MRP, the negative impact generated by a country’s DWF is 5.2% (±2.2%), whereas the MRP generated by the country’s domestic catch stays virtually unchanged (0.5 ± 3.1%). Therefore, countries with DWF are not only affected by the change in MCP in their own EEZ, but also affected by the climate change impacts in other EEZs and the high seas.
