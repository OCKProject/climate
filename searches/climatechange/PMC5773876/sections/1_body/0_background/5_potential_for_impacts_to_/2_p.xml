<p id="Par32" class="p">The northward spread of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> indicates the need for active surveillance for invasive mosquitoes. There is strong evidence that some of the spread of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> in continental Europe is associated with transport in vehicles as, for example, it has been trapped in motorway service areas. The extensive movement of cars and goods vehicles into the UK from continental Europe should be considered a likely route of entry of this mosquito. Insecticidal treatment of vehicles entering the UK could help to reduce this risk. ‘Disinsection’, as described by the International Health Regulations of the WHO, is already used to kill insects in airplanes arriving in certain countries. 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic> has also entered many countries in used vehicle tyres or in ‘lucky bamboo’, a houseplant imported from China. Mosquito surveillance at ports of entry of such products is recommended.
