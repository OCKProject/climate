<p id="Par28" class="p">The main threat to the UK from dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses is tied to the risk of invasion by 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>. The suitability of the current European climate for both vectors and dengue transmission has been modelled [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Much of Europe, including many parts of the UK, were found to be suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>; however, few areas of Europe, and none in the UK, were suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. Other workers report similar findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Three models indicate that large parts of the UK are already suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> and predict increased climatic suitability in future. Importantly, in autumn 2016 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> eggs were collected for the first time in the UK (southern England) [
