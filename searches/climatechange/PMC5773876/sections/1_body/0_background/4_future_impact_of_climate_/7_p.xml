<p id="Par30" class="p">While there is consensus that climate affects the transmission of tick-borne Lyme borreliosis, and some agreement that the northward spread of the vector in Sweden is attributable to recent warming, there are no published models projecting its future incidence in Europe under scenarios of climate change. Models for other temperate regions predict that climate change will allow northern expansion of the range of the tick vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Lyme and its vectors are already found throughout the UK and, therefore, increasing climate suitability may be limited to increase in altitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>] and change in incidence. Non-climate drivers, however, play a dominant role in the epidemiology of Lyme disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] and future trends in agriculture, land use, wild animal populations and tourism will play a large role in determining future patterns of the disease [
