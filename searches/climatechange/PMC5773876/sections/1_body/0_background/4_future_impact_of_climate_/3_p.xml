<p id="Par26" class="p">It is important to note, however, that all five malaria models were developed and parameterized for malaria caused by 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic>, while it was malaria from 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> that was previously endemic in northern Europe, including the UK, and which has recently reoccurred in Europe. 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium vivax</italic> transmission by European vectors requires lower temperature thresholds than 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> and, therefore, all five malaria models and WHO’s assessments underestimate the risk of malaria in Europe. By contrast, under a medium-high scenario of climate change, a model parameterized for 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> predicts that the southern half of Great Britain will be climatically-suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> malaria transmission by 2030 for 2 months of the year, and parts of the southeast of England for 4 months per year [
