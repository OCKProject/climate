<p id="Par2" class="p">There is widespread scientific agreement that anthropogenic activities are contributing to the warming of the world’s climate at an unprecedented rate, with concomitant changes in precipitation, flooding, winds and the frequency of extreme events. Many studies have demonstrated links between infectious diseases and climate, and it is highly likely that changes in climate will impact on at least some of them. This review summarises the state of scientific evidence regarding current and future impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the emergence of infectious diseases with potential to impact significantly on the UK human population. Infections are defined as ‘emerging’ if they “have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range” [
