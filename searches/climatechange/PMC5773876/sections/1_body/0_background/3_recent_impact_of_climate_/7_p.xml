<p id="Par17" class="p">There is a significant risk that Zika virus, which is believed to have infected over a million people in South America in 2015â€“2016, will emerge in Europe in 2016 or 2017. Both 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> are competent vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] and the greatest risk is where these vectors are present. Most studies find the vector competence of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> for Zika virus to be higher than that of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> and this, combined with the greater anthropophily and biting rates of the former [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>], suggests that the risk of Zika transmission in Europe is highest where 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> is present (i.e. Madeira, Georgia), and lower where only 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> is present. There may be other mosquitoes in UK/Europe capable of transmitting Zika virus that we are currently unaware of. Zika virus can also be spread sexually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>], and there is a small risk of transmission outside of areas with competent vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>].
