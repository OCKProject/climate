 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium vivax</italic> and spread by the bites of 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, used to be endemic the UK but there has been no transmission via native mosquitoes for over 60 years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Similar changes have occurred in mainland Europe and no areas are now endemic for the disease. In 2009–2012, however, outbreaks of 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> malaria occurred in Greece, after nearly 40 years of only sporadic cases. This is not linked to climate change: the origins are likely to be migrant workers introducing 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> into an agricultural region where vectors were present [

Nevertheless, environmental risk modelling showed that the regions of Greece affected by malaria in 2009–2012 could be successfully predicted using digital elevation (i.e. altitude) and satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature variables, indicating an important role of temperature in determining where transmission is possible, following an introduction [
