<p id="Par18" class="p">Sandflies are vectors of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in people and dogs in southern Europe. There is a low incidence in people (~700 cases per year in southern Europe) but a high incidence in dogs (about 5000 cases per year in France alone) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Sandflies have not been detected in the UK but have been found in central and northern France and southern Germany [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The presence of known vectors in northern Europe, and the passport-controlled movement of potentially infected dogs into the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], raises the possibility of the eventual introduction of leishmaniasis.
