<p id="Par19" class="p">Two tick-borne diseases have emerged in Europe in recent decades, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease, both transmitted by the sheep tick, 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinus.</italic> The emergence of TBE is a major concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. There are thousands of cases of human disease each year, the incidence is increasing, and it is spreading to new regions. Possible causes of this emergence are socioeconomic, environmental and climatic changes, as well as increased awareness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. The role of climate change on TBE emergence in the Baltics is contested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] and other drivers of disease emergence, such as change in human behavior, are believed to be important factors in this region [
