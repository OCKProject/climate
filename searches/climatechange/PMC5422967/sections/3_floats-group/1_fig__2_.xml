  <p class="p">Schematic representation of some of the interactions between plant nitrogen status and defense signaling. In concert with reactive oxygen species (ROS), NO acts to mediate plant hormone signaling and anti-pathogen defenses. Atmospheric NO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> can enter leaves and stimulate the production of NO, while abiotic stress interacts with biotic stress signaling via both ROS and NO. In addition, plant nitrogen status can impose restraints on defense signaling when low and promote NO production if high. Factors including root features, soils, and soil ecology that may affect plant nitrogen status are not represented in this figure
