<p class="p">Changes in global climate are generally projected to comprise an increase in global average temperatures of around 1–2 °C by 2100, alongside an increase in the frequency of extreme events including periods of high temperature, storms, or drought [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. These changes will influence pathogen emergence in new areas; these influences are discussed in the following sections. Climate alters the susceptibility of the host, and influences the host cultivars planted. It also drives the distribution of hosts, both cultivated and wild, alters trade patterns, and determines ranges of competitor and biocontrol species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Climate also affects the virulence of many pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. In response to these changes in climate and their direct and indirect effects on crops and their pathogens, new crop varieties may be developed. This process currently takes around 20 years on average [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>], however, so that while adaptation is possible it may be outpaced by continuing, rapid change.
