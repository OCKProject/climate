<p class="p">Climate change is not simply gradual increases or decreases of temperature or rainfall, but results in unpredictable short-term changes in weather and extreme weather events. These can alter the likelihood of the spread, establishment and epidemics of pathogens in new areas. Citrus canker, a water-droplet borne bacterial disease, became irrevocably established in Florida after four hurricanes made landfall during 2004 [

 <italic class="italic">Dothistroma</italic> needle blight have been found to correlate with above average rainfall events in British Colombia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>] studied the effects upon pathogens of the drought which affected the UK in 1976. In fungi, these effects were dependent upon pathogenic lifestyle: many foliar pathogens were less successful in producing aerial spores, while soil-borne species were largely unaffected [

 <italic class="italic">.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>] attempted to characterize the contribution of extreme weather events to disease outbreaks globally, and attributed 10â€“80% variation in agricultural productivity to weather extremes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. Taken together, these examples illustrate the importance of the inherently unpredictable result of climate change upon weather.
