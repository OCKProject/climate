<p class="p">The greatest factor driving pathogen distributions is the distribution of the host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], followed by the distribution of alternative hosts and the availability of susceptible hosts throughout the year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. There is evidence that saturation of hosts by pathogens should be expected in the long term [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>], and that the speed at which this happens is largely dependent on trade and transport of hosts and host products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. The accuracy of disease predictions thus depends upon the ability to predict trade, land use and crop choice, all of which may depend, themselves, upon climate and disease incidence.
