<p class="p">In common with 
 <italic class="italic">P. ramorum</italic>, many pathogens are expected to change their ranges as a result of climate change (for example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]). Recently, Bebber et al
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] used historical disease data to show that crop pests and pathogens have been moving towards the poles at an average of 2.5–3 km per year since 1960, as global temperatures have increased. This rate is as high as 6–7 km per year for fungi and oomycetes. A number of studies have attempted to model future pathogen distributions using either climate matching [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] or process-based approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Both have limitations, and it can be hard to test their underlying assumptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Some authors argue that predictions of pathogen spread and impact are too uncertain to have a role in shaping policy, and that we are better served by preparing for multiple scenarios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. This view is based upon the paucity of present and historical disease occurrence data, difficulties with modeling and extrapolating into the future, and complexities inherent in understanding how a prediction of pathogen emergence translates into risk of yield loss.
