<p class="p">One complication is that the presence of pathogens affects the plantsâ€™ nitrogen metabolism through both altered nitrogen sinks in infected tissues and plant defense activities evolved to deprive the pathogen of nutrients [

 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic> produces altered floral volatiles after nitrogen fertilization, including an increase in acetic acid, an antifungal to which a correlated fall in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>], which were more susceptible to powdery mildew when grown on increased nitrogen, also showed reduced levels of defensive polyphenols under these conditions. Further, low nitrogen availability may lead to reduced investment in defenses, with lower activity of the anti-fungal enzymes chitinase, chitosanase, and peroxidase in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> under such conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>]. The
