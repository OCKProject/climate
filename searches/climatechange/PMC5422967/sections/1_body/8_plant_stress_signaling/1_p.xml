<p class="p">Increased atmospheric NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> does not only affect plants after being deposited into their ecosystem; it also has more direct effects upon plant growth. Generally, NO and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pollution leads to reduced growth of plants. This is because, as well as interacting with other atmospheric molecules with potentially deleterious results, both act as toxins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>]. NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is taken up by foliar tissues via the stomata [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">107</xref>], and, at low concentrations, can act as a nitrogen fertilizer, being largely translocated to the root [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>] and decreasing carbon/nitrogen ratios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">110</xref>]. Although, as discussed above, these changes in nitrogen nutrition may have knock-on effects for plantâ€“pathogen interaction, the real significance of foliar NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> absorption comes from its induction of reactive nitrogen within the leaf.
