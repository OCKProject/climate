<p class="p">Once produced, NO and its ions are well-adapted as signaling molecules, diffusing easily throughout the cytoplasm and across lipid bilayers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>]. NO is implicated in many aspects of plant physiology and development, including pollen tube growth, germination, leaf and root organogenesis, cell wall lignification, flowering, fruit ripening, and senescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>]. It is a signal of abiotic stresses, including drought, salt, high light intensity and UV, high and low temperatures, wounding, ozone, and heavy metals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>]. NO also signals biotic stresses such as pathogen attack [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>] or establishment of plant-microbe symbioses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">125</xref>], a process that initially elicits many elements of the plant defense response, later suppressed by compatible symbionts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>]. As with ROS signaling, it is emerging that pathogens also rely on RNS in development and as a virulence factor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" class="xref">127</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">128</xref>] and that plant RNS signaling can be hijacked by pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">128</xref>], as well as by beneficial micro-organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129" class="xref">129</xref>]. Taken together, the various signaling roles of RNS in plantâ€“microbe interactions develop as complex a picture as do the roles of ROS (for example, [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">131</xref>]).
