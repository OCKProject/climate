<p class="p">During the oxidative and nitrosative bursts, RNS can react with ROS. For example, peroxynitrite is formed when superoxide meets nitrogen oxide. Thus, the two sets of reactive molecules can modulate each otherâ€™s concentrations and signaling functions. NO increases the antioxidant capacity of plant cells, protecting the plant from its own ROS response to stressors, including pathogens, UV, and salt [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">134</xref>]. NO can interact with DNA and transcription factors directly, and S-nitrosylation of transcription factors and other proteins can lead to altered gene expression and protein activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" class="xref">135</xref>]. As a result of these abilities, NO can influence the SA signaling pathway at various stages from upregulation of SA biosynthesis, to nitrosylation of transcription factors that facilitate the expression of SA-dependent genes, to nitrosylation of NPR1, promoting oligomerization of this protein and its retention in the cytoplasm, which, by contrast, reduces SA-dependent gene expression [
