<p class="p">Importantly, RNS and ROS signaling occur in plants in response to exogenous NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. High levels of exogenous NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are phytotoxic and can induce stunting, cell death, lipid peroxidation, production and activation of ascorbate, glutathione, and anti-oxidant enzymes, protein modifications, and the induction of SA, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">118</xref>]. All of these downstream effects of NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exposure are either directly involved with, or have the capacity to interact with, defense signaling, although the roles of factors such as plant hormones and antioxidants in plant stress signaling have been reviewed elsewhere and are too large a topic to summarize here.
