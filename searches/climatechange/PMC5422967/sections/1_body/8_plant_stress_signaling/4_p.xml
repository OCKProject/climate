<p class="p">Uptake of atmospheric NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by foliar tissues shows a linear relationship to its concentration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>]. Once inside the leaf, NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is rapidly solubilized into the apoplast, forming NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, and H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>]. It has been assumed that the reason that NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is phytotoxic is that nitrite ions are transported to the chloroplast, where they reduce stromal pH and compete for NADP
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, reducing carbon fixation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>]. Indeed, photosynthesis is sensitive to NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>]. Reduced photosynthetic capacity following this toxicity is likely to lead to energy conserving down-regulation of defenses, as seen for low nitrogen status. More important in the current discussion, however, is the role of NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in increasing the foliar concentrations of NO. This can occur in at least two ways. Firstly, as is well known in inorganic systems, NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> spontaneously evolves NO at low pH, a process greatly enhanced by the presence of a reductant such as ascorbate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>]. This may occur, for instance, in the mildly acidic apoplast where NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> first dissolves to form NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, and where ascorbate is an important antioxidant following the uptake of this gas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">121</xref>]. Secondly, nitrate reductase in the chloroplasts can produce NO from NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, using NADPH as an electron donor, accounting for the competition effect with respect to NADPH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>]. This pathway for NO production from NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> absorbed via the stomata has been demonstrated to occur commonly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">120</xref>].
