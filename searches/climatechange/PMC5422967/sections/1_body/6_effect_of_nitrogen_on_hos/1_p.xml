<p class="p">Nitrogen can alter the susceptibility of plants to disease in two major ways. Firstly, plantsâ€™ nitrogen status may impact on their nutritional value to pathogens; secondly, nitrogen affects plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. Altered abiotic stress responses naturally alter plant responses to changes in climate, but also influence responses to pathogens, through crosstalk with biotic stress signaling.</p>
