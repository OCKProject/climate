<p class="p">An emerging plant pathogen (EPP) is the causative agent of a new disease, an infection on a novel host, or a pathogen in an extended geographic range. EPPs arise as a result of the continuous evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen. We have, however, recently witnessed an intensification in the rate at which EPPs arise, bringing with it increased threats to natural and agricultural ecosystems [
