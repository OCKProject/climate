<p class="p">Due to the rising human population, both energy use and global food requirements have risen. Whilst crop production has increased steeply since the Green Revolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>], it must continue to increase if we are to meet future needs. A portion of the increase in yields has been due to a rise in agricultural inputs. Most notably, from 1950–2000 the use of nitrogen fertilizers increased more than 20-fold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. This was made possible by the development of the Haber–Bosch process for fixing atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. Industrial production of nitrogen fertilizers began in the early 20th century [
