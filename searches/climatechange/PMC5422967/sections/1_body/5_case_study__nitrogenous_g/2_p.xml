<p class="p">Since production of these nitrogenous gases is correlated with human population, energy use, and, therefore, with the emissions—such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and methane—that underlie climate change, prediction of crop disease under climate change requires that their many possible interactions with pathogens and hosts alike are effectively incorporated into models describing climate change scenarios. Anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere that may influence plant–pathogen interactions are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. A first step to building such models would be to understand what happens to the nitrogen lost from agro-ecosystems. Nitrates are often lost as runoff, but other nitrogenous waste products are lost to the atmosphere where, eventually, they revert to N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>]. Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are not limited to fertilizer application, but include increased deposition of nitrogen as a result of its increased atmospheric concentrations and resulting changes to the nitrogen cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>]. The rate of reactive nitrogen (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) emissions currently exceeds the rate of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> formation, meaning that nitrogen is building up in the atmosphere and in ecosystems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>]. NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> emission and deposition rates are currently over ten times greater than those occurring naturally, and are expected to exceed levels thought to be ecologically safe by 2050 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>]. Reactive nitrogen can be metabolized by many soil microbes, and can thus alter the soil and rhizosphere microbiomes, which will in turn affect soil microfauna and plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>]. Like the effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, nitrogen deposition does not necessarily take place in the same geographical area as emission; rates of deposition are greatest in vulnerable tropical and forest ecosystems and agro-ecosystems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>].
