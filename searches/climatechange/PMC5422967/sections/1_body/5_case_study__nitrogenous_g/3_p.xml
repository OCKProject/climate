This is barely scratching the surface of the complexity of interactions between atmospheric nitrogen, plants, and climate. Pathogens, their responses to nitrogen, both direct and indirect, and the downstream effects upon the hosts, ecosystems, emissions of carbon and nitrogen, and the effect of climate change resulting from those emissions on the pathogens and their hosts provide a circle—or perhaps spiral—of complex interacting factors and outcomes.
