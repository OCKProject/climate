<p class="p">The impact of combined abiotic and biotic stresses on plants, imposed by a changing climate, will also alter host susceptibility to EPPs (for example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]). Such interactions take place at various levels, including early signaling hubs such as calcium-dependent and mitogen-activated protein kinases (for example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]), reactive oxygen (ROS) signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]), and other signaling molecules (for example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]). These signals modulate gene transcription, cell biology, and physiology to respond to multiple stresses appropriately [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], which will also respond to climate variations [
