 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] describe two groups. The first group infects stressed plants and will become more problematic under climate change-induced stress. Examples include 
 <italic class="italic">M. phaseolina</italic> and canker diseases of trees caused by opportunistic fungi, including the emerging pathogen of oak, 
 <italic class="italic">Biscogniauxia mediterranea</italic>. This fungus was first described in Mediterranean oaks; however, it emerged in Slovenia in 2006 [
