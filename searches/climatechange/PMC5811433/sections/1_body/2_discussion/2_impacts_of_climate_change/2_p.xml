 </sup> had similar conclusion in terms of grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase in Xinjiang, none of them could tell how much human activities played as compared with climate change for the NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase. Specifically, based on the MK test of this study, there was not much difference in terms of contributions of climate and human activities to the grassland change before 2005, while human activities has become the dominant role for the overall grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase since 2005. This finding has significant implication in terms of (1) understanding the regional difference of climate change to ecological environment change, (2) the important role of human activities and management to such change, in particularly, to the arid grassland area, and (3) the importance of accurately assess climate and human impacts on different environments for better policy making.
