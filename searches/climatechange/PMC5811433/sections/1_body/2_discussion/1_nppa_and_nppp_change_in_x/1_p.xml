 <sub class="sub">P</sub> in Xinjiang also showed an overall increasing trend. The increase may be related to the fact that, in the past ten years, the average annual temperature and precipitation in Xinjiang have increased, showing an overall trend of warm - wet climate

This further indicates that, the variability in actual and potential productivity may different throughout the global grassland ecosystems, and may show various trends in different grassland regions, since human activities and climate change present various contributions to the productivity of grassland in different regions.
