 </sup>. Although regulations were implemented for meadow re-vegetation with appropriate rest periods, project implementation was difficult due to the high altitude. Additionally, the livestock exiled from the desert grassland were moved to the meadow, increasing the pressure from grazing in those regions. This led the NPP
