<p id="Par20" class="p">Based on our finding from this study, below are our recommendations for grasslandâ€™s further recovery. (1) For the desert grassland, grazing prohibition should be continued in this region. (2) Although the steppe and meadow partially implemented the rest grazing policy, the changing trend of the two grasslands are significantly different. NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease trend in meadow is obvious; the NPP decreased area accounts for 67.7% of the meadow area, in which, 49.5% was due to human activities. The steppe NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decreased area accounts for 49.4% of the steppe area, in which 23.7% was due to human activities. The reason for the larger NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease in meadow could be mainly due to its higher altitude, which made the implementation of the grassland project more difficult. For example, the fencing project was not completed, resulted in that the livestock transferred to the high altitude meadow, some to steppe. This increased the grazing pressure to these two types of grasslands, especially of the meadow land. Therefore, in order to reduce the grazing pressure in these two types of grassland, the number of livestock should be appropriately reduced, and grass planting should be developed in areas with better light, water and heat resources, and herder settlement projects should be extensively implemented.
