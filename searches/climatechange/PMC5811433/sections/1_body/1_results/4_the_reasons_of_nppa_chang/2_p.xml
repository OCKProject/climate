<p id="Par13" class="p">In terms of three different types of grassland, their changes and relative reasons of change are different. For example, the NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decreased and increased area percentages of the Steppe are very similar (~50% each), with similar impacts from both the climate and human activities (~25% each); however, the Desert grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> has a totally different picture, with 82.8% area showing increase, and the human activities account for 70.1% of it. In contrast, a total 67.7% of Meadow NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> shows decrease, with human activities contributed 49.5% of this decrease. Of the 32.3% meadow NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase, climate change contributes 26.1% of it.
