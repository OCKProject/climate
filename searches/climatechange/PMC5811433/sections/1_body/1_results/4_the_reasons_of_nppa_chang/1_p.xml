<p id="Par12" class="p">Climate change and human activities have led to the pattern changes of the Xinjiang grasslands, but their relative effects are different in time and space. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the relative effects of climate change (SlopeNPP
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) and human activities (SlopeNPP
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>) on grassland change (SlopeNPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>) in six different scenarios. Based on the 6 possible scenarios of climate change and human activities (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), the relative roles of them are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The reasons for grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease or increase have apparent dissimilarities. For example, the human-induced total grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increased area accounts for 53.1% of the total 69.7% NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increased area and are mainly distributed on the margins of the Junggar Basin, Altai Mountain, adjacent areas to the Junggar Basin, some local areas in the Kunlun Mountains, and eastern Xinjiang region. Climate-induced total grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase only accounts for 16.6% of the total 69.7% NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increased areas and are mainly in the surrounding areas of Tarim Basin, except the northeast of the Basin. Only 30.3% of grassland shows NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease, with human activity-induced NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease accounted for 16.7%, slightly higher than the 13.6% induced by the climate change. These NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decreased areas are mostly distributed in the northern Xinjiang, including the central Altai mountains, the Ili river Valley (mostly climate-induced), the Junggar Basin (mostly human-induced), and the southern slope of Tianshan Mountain (mostly human-induced).
