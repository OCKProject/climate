<p id="Par10" class="p">The MK test shows some abrupt points on the mean NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and NPP
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> trends from 2000–2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). From the actual NPP (NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>), an overall grassland improvement is indicated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>), although it is insignificant at 95% level. However, after 2013, there is a mutation point, which suggests that the grassland NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase became more obvious. For the steppe grassland (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>), a significant NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease before increase in 2009 is found. For the desert grassland (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>), a NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> increase is clearly seen since 2000 and such increase became significant in 2013. This is also suggested by the mutation point seen after 2013. For the meadow grassland (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2D</xref>), an overall significant NPP
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> decrease is clearly seen.
