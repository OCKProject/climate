<p id="Par21" class="p">Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region (34°22′–49°33′ N, 73°22′–96°21′ E) is located in northwestern China, with an area of 166 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, accounting for approximately 1/6 of China. Situated at the center of the Eurasian continent, it is surrounded by high mountains: the Altai Mountains to the north, the Kunlun Mountains to the south, and the Tianshan Mountains in the central part. The Tianshan Mountain cut across northern Xinjiang between the vast Junggar and Tarim basins. These three mountains and two basins form the unique geographical environment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Xinjiang features a mean annual temperature of 9–12 °C, annual precipitation of 100–200 mm in the north and 16–85 mm in the south, and annual potential evaporation of 1500–2300 mm in the north and 2100–3400 mm in the south. The grassland ecosystems in Xinjiang are mainly distributed across Tianshan Mountain, Altai Mountain, Kunlun Mountain, and along the rivers of Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin.
