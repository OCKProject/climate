Using the MODIS re-projection tool for mosaic and re-projection processing, the 16-days of NDVI data are composited as a monthly data set using the maximum value composite method for reducing the residual noise caused by haze and clouds. The composited NDVI images are then processed by employing an adaptive Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter to obtain the final monthly NDVI data sets for use.
