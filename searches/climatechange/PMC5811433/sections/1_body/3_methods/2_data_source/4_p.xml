The data were usually collected in late July or August at each grassland site (500 × 500 m). The biomass samples of five quadrates (1 × 1 m) of each site were harvested, and were oven-dried at 65 °C for 48 h to a constant mass and then weighed and averaged as the weight for the site (i.e., AGB); Using the ratio index (i.e., underground biomass divided by aboveground biomass) of each grass type to convert the AGB to total biomass in counting both aboveground and underground biomasses
