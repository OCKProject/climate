<p id="Par5" class="p">At present, two types of methods have been used to calculate the relative effects of human activities on grassland ecological change. The first method is to use regression analysis or principal component analysis in determining the relative importance of meteorological, social, and economic factors on grassland primary productivity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. However, this method emphasizes more on the regression coefficients and rates of variance that represent the relative importance on climate change and human activity, while ignores their real ecological significances in a qualitative way
