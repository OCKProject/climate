<p id="Par6" class="p">The second method is to use remotely sensed indices of higher spatial and temporal resolutions in determining the importance of each factor of climate and human activities on the grassland dynamics; commonly the net primary productivity (NPP) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used. The NPP is the amount of solar energy converted to chemical energy by vegetation through the process of photosynthesis and represents the total amount of organic matter accumulated by vegetation per unit area and time; it is an important parameter of ecosystem functioning and the carbon cycle
