<p id="Par3" class="p">Grassland ecosystem, as one of the important terrestrial ecosystems, plays an important role in regulating global carbon cycle and climate. Meanwhile, grassland ecosystem is also related to the ecological and environmental conditions of its surrounding areas, as well as the socio-economic development and regional ecological safety. In recent years, with the increase in temperature and precipitation, plus implementation of various programs for ecological protection at local, regional and national levels, increase of grassland net primary productivity in some areas of China has been reported
