<p id="Par4" class="p">The grassland in Xinjiang is ranked as the third largest grassland in China, accounting for 34.43% of the total land area in Xinjiang

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. As an arid and semi-arid region, the ecosystem in Xinjiang is extremely fragile, and the grassland ecosystem is generally more fragile and/or sensitive to climate change and human activity (i.e., overgrazing, amelioration, grazing prohibition, rest grazing and grassland reclamation)

 </sup>. Moreover, the impacts of climate change and human activity showed a great spatial heterogeneity among different vegetation types in Northern Xinjiang

 </sup>. Hence, the local government has been facing difficulties in determining how to manage the grassland in such a complex environment and how to determine the degree to which grassland has been affected by human activities and/or climate change. Thus, an effective method is needed for addressing the impacts of climate change and human activities on different grassland types.
