<p id="p0300" class="p">According to RMSE, MADE, MSE, and MAPE, modelled data presented errors, and radiation had the most expressive errors. An important variable inserted in the ENVI-met program refers to cloudiness. It is known that clear sky (without clouds) is the ideal measurement condition (
