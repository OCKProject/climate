<p class="p">As we have discussed, national governments are taking different roles in public health adaptation. Our results and the literature likewise show that vertical coordination may take many forms, including institutionalized coordination bodies (e.g., working groups), network and partnerships, informal communication channels, monitoring and reporting schemes, and temporary coordination and consultation for elaborating national adaptation plans [
