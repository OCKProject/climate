<p class="p">Countries are developing their own policy style, learning from key lessons ascertained in other countries as well as mimicking successful approaches. Whilst constitutionally defined governing structures are important features in the ways public health adaptation are governed, they do not determine the ways in which public health adaptation takes place, therefore showing a great variety of policy initiatives, both substantive as well as procedural. This is not necessarily a bad thingâ€”countries are clearly experimenting with different ways how to best govern public health adaptation across sectors and levels, as the diversity and rapid increase of policy initiatives suggests. Tracking this progress then becomes of utmost importance to assess and evaluate whether progress is going in the right direction. </p>
