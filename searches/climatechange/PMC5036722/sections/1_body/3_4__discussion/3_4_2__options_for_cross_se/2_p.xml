 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Our review of national adaptation plans and other academic literature suggest other sectors (e.g., environment, natural resources) or climate change commissions (or equivalent) most often tend to take the lead coordinating role in national adaptation [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Health agencies can thus collaborate with coordinating sectors on national adaptation planning or actively collaborate with other sectors on a policy or program level. We find that the UK and France have notably included multiple sectors in health adaptation initiatives. The UK has taken a partnerships approach to adaptation and cross-sectoral collaboration, illustrated, for example, by the UK Natural Hazards Partnership, which prepares a daily hazard assessment (early warning system) and is comprised of thirteen diverse bodies including the Health Protection Agency, the Environment Agency and the UK Space Agency [

Bowen and Ebi have also identified creating collaborative networks, demonstrating leadership, integrating across organizations, scales and sectors, and coordinating government policies as additional approaches to cross-sectoral collaboration [

Challenges to cross-sectoral collaboration identified in the literature include: differing agency mandates and responsibilities; clarifying institutional arrangements to bridge gaps between sectors; and identifying sufficient funding sources, as funding typically comes from within sectors [
