<p class="p">A ‘one size fits all’ set of criteria is not appropriate for adaptation [
 <xref rid="B106-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Based on our findings and insights from academic literature we outline options and approaches for cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning for national governments in countries with different state structures, jurisdictional contexts and administrative traditions. While many other best practices for health adaptation have been identified in the academic literature, these three dimensions were selected due to the consensus for their need across academic literature, for their pertinence to public health adaptation challenges, and most importantly for their flexibility and applicability across country contexts.
