 <xref rid="B113-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>], in this study we have examined exclusively national-level public health adaptation. Sub-national governments are important players in adaptation, particularly where some may have the jurisdictional mandate for public health and adaptation; however, their large number makes them outside the scope of this study. We do not make claims to have tracked public health adaptation in the sampled countries beyond the national government, but have examined the ways in which governments create an enabling environment. Focusing exclusively on national governments, however, allows us to compare and contrast national-level approaches to public health adaptation, consider variations with governing structure, and identify possible adaptation options for national governments.
