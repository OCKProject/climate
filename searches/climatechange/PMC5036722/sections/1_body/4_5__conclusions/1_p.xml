 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In this study we have systematically assessed how national governments report adapting to the health risks posed by climate change, reviewed national governments’ roles in public health adaptation and examined practical options for incorporating three key dimensions for national-level governance of public health adaptation—cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination, and national health adaptation planning—across different country contexts.
