 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-13-00889" class="xref">Table S3 of Supplementary Materials</xref>). Countries with smaller populations (e.g., Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand) reported fewer health adaptation initiatives than countries with larger populations with the exception of Australia which has a relatively large population and high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but reported few health adaptation initiatives (
