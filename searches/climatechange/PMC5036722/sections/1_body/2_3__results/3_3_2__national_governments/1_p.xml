<p class="p">National government adaptation initiatives were, averaging across countries, 62% groundwork and 38% adaptation actions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00889-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The exceptions are France, Belgium and Luxembourg, which report planning or implementing &gt;50% adaptation actions each. Meanwhile, most countries reporting &gt;10 initiatives are planning or implementing some combination of all five adaptation types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00889-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). In Canada and the UK, capacity building initiatives dominate, and are predominantly guidebooks, frameworks or toolkits, while in the US these initiatives are a combination of training and professional education, guidebooks, frameworks or toolkits, and dissemination. France and Belgium report implementing or planning the highest number of practice and behaviour initiatives, including initiatives to adapt the techniques used in building health facilities (France) and eradicate the

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-13-00889-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) report similar adaptation approaches. The UK and the US, for example, report similar groundwork vs. adaptation initiatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00889-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) despite greater centralization in the UK. Likewise, Belgium and France show similarity in adaptation types being planned or implemented (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00889-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), despite contrasting administrative structures. Indeed, some of the sampled countries with federal, decentralized administrative structures are taking central roles in coordinating adaptation across jurisdictional levels, such as Belgium and Switzerland, through legislation and coordinated adaptation planning.
