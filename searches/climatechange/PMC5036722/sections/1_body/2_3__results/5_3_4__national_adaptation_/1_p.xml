<p class="p">All sampled OECD countries have publicly available adaptation planning documents, with the exception of New Zealand. Of the nine national governments with a national adaptation planning document, only Canada and Ireland’s documents do not include explicit health sections [

 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. Ireland’s adaptation framework states that sectoral adaptation plans would be completed by mid-2014 [

 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Canada’s National Adaptation Policy Framework does not include any sector-specific sections or specific adaptation initiatives, but rather serves to outline the federal government role in adaptation [

 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], while for others adaptation plans are more detailed action plans, such as in Switzerland’s adaptation plan, which outlines responsible agencies and financing for each initiative [
 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Most of the sampled countries reporting a high number of public health adaptation initiatives have national legislation (or executive orders in the case of the US) for climate change which may have contributed to progress on adaptation planning (i.e., UK Climate Change Act (2008); Belgium Climate Cooperation Agreement (2002); Switzerland CO2 Act (2013); France Law n° 2009–967 (2009); US Executive Orders 13514 (2009) and 13653 (2013)). Meanwhile, New Zealand’s Resource Management Act Section 7 (i) was amended in 2004 to legally devolve statutory responsibility for consideration of climate change to local governments, which may explain in part the low number of reported national-level health adaptation initiatives.
