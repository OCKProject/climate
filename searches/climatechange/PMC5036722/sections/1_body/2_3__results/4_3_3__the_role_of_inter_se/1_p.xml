<p class="p">Based on publicly available information, most adaptation initiatives were planned, initiated or implemented by national health or public health agencies, often in partnership with other bodies (including other health agencies). France, Belgium, the UK and New Zealand report the greatest percentage of health adaptation initiatives (~50%) being implemented (or planned) by, or in collaboration with, agencies or departments outside of the health sector (e.g., forestry sector, water resources sector, built environment sector, defense sector). In France, for example, the initiative to monitor vectors and host reservoirs is a collaboration between four health agencies and the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea. Meanwhile in Canada, the US, and Switzerland, the vast majority of reported health adaptation initiatives are being planned, initiated and/or implemented solely within the health sector (82%, 78% and 69%, respectively). Though reporting a lower percentage of health adaptation initiatives conducted with other sectors, Switzerland is the only country reviewed to include animal health in the health section of its national adaptation plan, with significance for evaluating zoonotic disease risks [
