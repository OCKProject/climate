<p class="p">National governments most frequently report planning broad health adaptation initiatives, and otherwise emphasize infectious disease and heat-related risks. Nearly half of the health adaptation initiatives planned or implemented by national governments do not target specific health risks, likely due to the nature of national-level initiatives and policies intended to guide more targeted actions at the sub-national level (

 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The most frequently addressed health risks are infectious diseases (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 38) and heat-related risks (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 32). All of the sampled countries will or are experiencing changing incidence, prevalence or patterns of food-, water-, or vector-borne infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. For example, in northern Canada climate change is projected to increase the incidence and prevalence of food- and water-borne infectious diseases among indigenous communities, and in New Zealand climate change could allow new mosquito vectors to establish resulting in changing patterns of existing and emerging vector-borne infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Similarly, the emphasis on adaptation to protect populations from heat-related risks may be in response to the high level of mortality from recent heat waves in the sampled countries. Whereas we find national governments are planning or implementing fewer initiatives specifically targeting floods and storms (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 9), air quality (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4), ultraviolet (UV) radiation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4), mental health (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2) or cold-related risks (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00889-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), a study of sub-national health adaptation found that local governments are targeting flood and storm risks and heat-related risk, but not addressing infectious disease risks [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This variation suggests national-level governments are planning or implementing more population-level health adaptation initiatives, while local governmentsâ€™ health adaptation initiatives are more targeted to the local/regional level. Initiatives addressing the mental health risks associated with climate change have only been planned or implemented since 2013 within our sample. Despite recently receiving greater recognition in the academic literature [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], mental health and associated adaptation policy action received minimal attention in reporting on adaptation among the sampled countries.
