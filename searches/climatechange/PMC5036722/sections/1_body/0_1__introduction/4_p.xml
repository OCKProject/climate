<p class="p">Many national governments have started to recognize the impacts of climate change on health in their national adaptation strategies [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Countries with diverse state structures are expected to adapt differently to the impacts of climate change because their roles and responsibilities are distributed differently [

This means that some states will have adopted legislation to push for adaptation and/or created new institutional arrangements to ensure coherence and consistency in implementing public health adaptation across scales and across multiple policy domains [
