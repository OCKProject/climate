<p class="p">In practice, the role a national government may take in adaptation will be determined by many factors but particularly by their constitutionally defined governing structure [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Determining national responsibility for health adaptation and allocating responsibility for adaptation planning and financing can be particularly challenging where public health is primarily the responsibility of sub-national governments, as in most decentralized and federal countries [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Governing structure thus provides a useful point of analysis in researching public health adaptation to climate change. We draw on Lijphart’s classifications of federal/unitary and decentralization/centralization structure based on whether there is a formal (federal) constitution, and how powers are dispersed across scales [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], they nonetheless provide us with a useful starting point. In countries with federal, decentralized structures (where public health is typically primarily the responsibility of sub-national governments), national governments are expected to adopt a more supportive approach to adaptation and implement groundwork initiatives for capacity building and research, while national governments in unitary, centralized systems will implement more adaptation actions and take a stronger steering role [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Misalignment of adaptation policy initiatives with the traditional governing structure is often deemed problematic as it reduces coherency and consistency to deal with public health adaptation, and limits the likeliness that policy will be implemented successfully. In this study we examine national governments’ approaches to public health adaptation, considering differences in governance structure.
