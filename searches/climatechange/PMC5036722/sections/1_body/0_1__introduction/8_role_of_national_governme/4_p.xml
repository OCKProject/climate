<p class="p">Three key governance dimensions of public health adaptation have received greater consensus in academic literature: cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination, and national adaptation planning [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. These three dimensions stand out in the literature as highly necessary, pertinent to public health adaptation challenges, and applicable across country contexts. First, the health risks posed by climate change are cross-sectoral in nature, impacting health through multiple pathways, and involving a diversity of actors with varying roles and responsibilities, and different types of communities and populations with diverse vulnerabilities [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. One of the primary recommendations from the 2015 Lancet Commission on Climate Change and Health is for governments to facilitate collaboration between ministries of health and other departments, such as environment [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A multi-sectoral approach is required to address multiple drivers of adverse health outcomes of climate change and identify the most effective and efficient interventions. Second, as discussed above, national governments play a key role in coordinating or facilitating adaptation across scales and are uniquely positioned to carry out a variety of influential roles [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Without coordination, adaptation may take an isolated and piecemeal approach thereby increasing the chances of maladaptation (increasing vulnerability to climate change in the long term or of other sectors, social groups or systems) [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Climate change requires coordination of demands and needs across scales, to create synergies and avoid trade-offs between scales and at minimum to clarify jurisdictional roles and responsibilities in adaptation [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Other studies find most national governments have not taken a large leadership or steering role to date, and national adaptation policies are often disconnected from sub-national levels [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Lastly, national adaptation planning can serve to overcome challenges of horizontal and vertical coordination, provide a coherent and consistent public health adaptation policy, and enable and include private sector adaptation to invest resources (e.g., time, money) if or when needed. National adaptation plans may also be used to clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of sectors, agencies or scales, create consistency and synergy between national strategies, or meet regional adaptation planning requirements [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In this study we identify practical options for national governments to incorporate these three key governing dimensions into national-level public health adaptation planning in different contexts based on country experiences.
