<p class="p">A small number of papers have begun tracking national-level adaption to the health impacts of climate change [

 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], but in general little is known about how adaptation is occurring in practice. Lesnikowski et al. examined national-level adaptation to the health impacts of climate change in Annex I countries to the UNFCCC (i.e., high income nations) by reviewing adaptation initiatives reported in countries’ Sixth National Communication to the UNFCCC (NC6) [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. They present aggregated results and find that adaptation is piecemeal and mostly composed of groundwork initiatives, and that major health vulnerabilities are not being addressed by countries [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In a follow-up article, Lesnikowski et al. find national wealth, population size, perception of corruption, national environmental governance, and engagement in international environmental governance to have a statistically significant relationship with national-level health adaptation planning, suggesting that population size and national wealth are not sufficient to drive adaptation [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Panic and Ford conducted a systematic web search method to examine national-level adaptation planning in relation to infectious disease risks in 14 OECD countries, examining adaptation plans more broadly than specific initiatives [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. They also find adaptation planning to be an ad hoc and fragmented process, and note three primary gaps based on best practices identified in academic literature: consideration of vulnerable populations, emphasis on local risks, and logistics (i.e., how adaptation will be carried out in practice) [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our approach, presented here, combines Lesnikowski et al.’s focus on individual health adaptation initiatives with Panic and Ford and Bauer et al.’s examination of national adaptation plans [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Whilst some progress has been made on understanding how public health adaptation takes place and which role structural governing dimensions play, considerable questions remain which we address in the remainder of this paper.
