<p class="p">The assumption “mitigation is global, adaptation is local” has dominated adaptation discourse since the signing of the UNFCCC in 1992, but is increasingly questioned [

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] as empirical studies find that there is a lack of adaptive capacity (e.g., financial resources, technology, and training) at the local level, and local stakeholders require greater support, steering, and coordination from higher levels of government to adapt [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Moreover, adaptation requires integration in existing policy and governing structures to be most effective. National governments undeniably play a key role in health adaptation as they have profound (legal and resource) capacities to steer adaptation in general and public health adaptation in particular, however precisely what that role is—or should be—and its magnitude relative to other contexts, has been debated in academic literature [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Amundsen et al. and Paterson et al., for example, argue that the national level’s role is to place adaptation on the policy agenda and signal its importance to sub-national governments [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Similarly, but with a greater emphasis on providing research and support, others argue that the national level should identify priority areas while the local level carries out adaptation in practice [

A point of convergence in these debates is the need for national governments to take some form of action on adaptation, as its absence can be a constraint in itself to local-level adaptation and can contribute to inequitable levels of adaptation at sub-national levels [
