<p class="p">In this study, we systematically review national-level public health adaptation to climate change in ten Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. We aim to: (1) examine how national-level public health adaptation is occurring in OECD countries in terms of health risks addressed, types of adaptation initiatives being planned or implemented, incorporation of inter-sectoral activities, and state of national health adaptation planning; (2) examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation; and (3) critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national-level health adaptation—cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning—and identify practical examples suited to different contexts.</p>
