<p class="p">We first contextualize this study (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-13-00889" class="xref">Section 2</xref>), reviewing academic literature on national governments’ role in adaptation, approaches to public health adaptation, and transferable dimensions of public health adaptation policy. Following our empirical methods to systematically review national-level public health adaptation (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-13-00889" class="xref">Section 3</xref>), we describe the current state of reported national-level public health adaptation (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijerph-13-00889" class="xref">Section 4</xref>). We discuss the roles that national governments have taken for public health adaptation, identify options for cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national adaptation planning for public health, and the limitations of this study (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-ijerph-13-00889" class="xref">Section 5</xref>). We conclude by arguing that reviewing national-level public health adaptation to climate change provides a learning opportunity for other governments, and that, while adaptation decisions are context dependent, the three key governance dimensions identified are broadly relevant—though manifest differently through local contexts—across governing structures and traditions.
