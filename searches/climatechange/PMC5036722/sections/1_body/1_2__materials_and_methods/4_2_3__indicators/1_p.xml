<p class="p">For each initiative, we collected indicators aiming to coherently assess the quality of adaptation based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Fifth Assessment Report [

 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], and going beyond simply documenting the number of initiatives [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Discrete health adaptation initiatives were documented in a detailed spreadsheet and coded according to the following measures adopted from other studies [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]: year, implementing body, adaptation type, health risk addressed, and consideration of vulnerable groups. Adaptation type is broken down through two different classifications. The first refers to either 
 <italic class="italic">groundwork initiatives</italic> which build adaptive capacity, prepare the conditions for adaptation, or enable adaptation actions; or 
 <italic class="italic">adaptation actions</italic> which indicate action has actually been taken to reduce population’s health vulnerability or increase resilience [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The second adaptation typology classifies adaptation initiatives by capacity building, management planning and policy, practice and behaviour, information, and warning or observing systems (
