<p class="p">To consistently and systematically locate health adaptation initiatives in national policy documents, national adaptation plans, and government websites, in March 2015 we conducted systematic web searches and assessment of self-reporting, combining two approaches used in other adaptation tracking studies [

We then conducted reference tracking of the reviewed documents, reviewed each country’s NC6, and hand-searched each country’s equivalent of Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, and climate change commission(s) (where applicable).
