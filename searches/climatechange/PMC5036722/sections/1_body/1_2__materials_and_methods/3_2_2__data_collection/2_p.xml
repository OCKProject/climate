<p class="p">We conducted content analysis to both qualitatively and quantitatively review the health adaptation initiatives reported in the government documents and webpages retrieved in the systematic web search. Content analysis is a commonly used research method in the social sciences, one form of which allows the researcher to review secondary sources and count the frequency of a phenomena, in this case public health adaptation initiatives [

 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-13-00889" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Adaptation initiatives from webpages and documents were only included if explicitly described as adaptation to climate change and referred to as adaptation to protect human health. As such, initiatives such as infectious disease surveillance, which may already be designed for surveillance of changing and emerging infectious diseases, were excluded if not described as being an adaptation, despite potential contribution to increasing resilience or reducing vulnerability to climate change. Similarly, although adaptation initiatives in other sectors may indirectly also protect health, these were excluded if not explicitly intended to protect health for consistency in data collection and feasibility. These methods are consistent with other studies in this area [
