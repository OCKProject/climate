<p class="p">The threshold‐independent and threshold‐dependent measures were used to evaluate model performance. Area under the curve (AUC) metric, a typical threshold‐independent measure, was utilized as a measure of model accuracy ( Lobo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Values of AUC generally range from 0.5 (equivalent to that due to chance) to 1.0 (perfect performance). Values &gt; 0.9 are considered good, 0.7–0.9 are moderate, and &lt;0.7 are poor (Fielding &amp; Bell, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). The true skill statistic (TSS), a commonly used threshold‐dependent measure of model accuracy(Allouche, Tsoar, &amp; Kadmon, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), is calculated as sensitivity + specificity −1. Values &gt; 0.6 are considered good, 0.2–0.6 are fair to moderate, and &lt; 0.2 are poor (Allouche et al.,
