<p class="p">Feature types combination (FC) and regularization multiplier (RM) are two important parameters that affect model complexity (Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Muscarella et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). ENMeval, an R package, was proved to be useful for tuning these two parameters (RM and FC) (Muscarella et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Thus, corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) value was used to estimate the model complexity in MaxEnt (Dan &amp; Seifert, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>).The smallest AICc was chosen for model simulation and was thought to can reduce model complexity relative to the default model.
