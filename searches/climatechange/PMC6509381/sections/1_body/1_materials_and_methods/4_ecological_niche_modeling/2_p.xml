<p class="p">MaxEnt, one of the most popular machine algorithms, is designed for modeling the geographical distribution of species from the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>‐dimensional environmental variables spaces with presence‐only data (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). A 10‐fold cross‐validation procedure, which is preferable to penalty functions for assessing model generality, was implemented to replicate model runs and data partitions (Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). It holds out 10% of the data as a testing set at each of 10 iterations, training the model on the remaining 90% of the data in each iteration. Other specified parameters and their setting are maximum number of background points = 10,000, Maximum iterations = 1,000, Convergence threshold = 0.00001, prevalence = 0.5.
