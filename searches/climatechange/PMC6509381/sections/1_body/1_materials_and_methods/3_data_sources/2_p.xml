The presence records were resampled in ArcGIS 10.2 to ensure that there is only one observation within the 1° by 1° cell to avoid spatial autocorrelation and reduce sampling bias (Merckx et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), resulting in retention of 106 presence records. For the northern Chinese coast and southern Chinese coast, there were 56 presence records and 48 presence records, respectively.
