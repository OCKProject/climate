<p class="p">Specifically, the following issues will be addressed: (a) whether there are interactions among variables influencing the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic>, and how the role of the key variable varied according to different regions. (b) Identifying pure, shared, and coupling effects of climate change and sea level rise on the future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> and assessing the relative importance of them on different regions. (c) Determining the spatial distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora </italic>caused by climate change, sea level rise, and their interactions.
