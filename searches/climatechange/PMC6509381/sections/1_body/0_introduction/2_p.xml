<p class="p">It is now well established that the earth's climate is warming (Cazenave &amp; Cozannet, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Priest et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating, with a projection of global sea level rise of 0.75–1.90 m by next century (Team et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although previous studies have reported the impacts of projected sea level rise on salt marsh plant communities (Allen &amp; Lendemer, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Donnelly &amp; Bertness, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Kirwan et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), few investigators have examined the interactive effects of sea level rise and climate change for the salt marsh plants (Garner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Kirwan &amp; Mudd, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Their interactions and compounding effects may lead to reduced salt marsh sustainability (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Cherry, Mcknee, &amp; Grace, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and influenced the ability of salt marsh plant to survive (Kirwan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Kirwan (
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) also found that plants responses differed depending upon the elevation of the marsh relative to sea level under interactive effects. Recent studies showed that interactions may further change the composition of species assemblages and making important ecological processes at salt marshes uncertain in the future (Garner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Hanson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). So far, there has been little discussion about habitats change caused by the pure effects of climate change, sea level rise, and the shared and coupling effects from their interactions. Quantifying these effects will help us better understand the effects of climate change and sea level rise on the coastal ecosystem, and further accurately assess the risk caused by them.
