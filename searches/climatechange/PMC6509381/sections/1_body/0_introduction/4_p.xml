 <italic class="italic">Spartina alterniflora</italic> Loisel, native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), is a highly invasive species widely distributed along the Chinese coast (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). A large number of published studies have already revealed the physiological characteristics and expansion mechanisms of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> based on laboratory work (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Gu &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). These studies demonstrated that the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> is influenced by elevation, climate, soil salinity, inundation duration, pH, and many other variables could influence, but previous studies only focus on the single‐variable and ignore the interactive effects of multiple variables (Braun, Schindler, &amp; Rihm, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Daniel, Hubert, GertJan, &amp; Wim, 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although studies have recognized the importance of interactions, fewer researches have systematically identified interactions among variables (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Moreover, as a salt marsh plant, the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> is peculiarly prone to the impacts of coastal change. 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> is correlated with variations in sea level, and its productivity peaks at intermediate elevations within the intertidal zone (Kirwan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, no research has surveyed the response of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> to climate change, sea level rise, and their interactions. Through the maximum entropy model, we built ecological niche models to explore the response of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> to climate change, sea level rise, and their interactions under three future scenarios (only considering climate change, only considering sea level rise and both considering climate change and sea level rise) on the northern and southern Chinese.
