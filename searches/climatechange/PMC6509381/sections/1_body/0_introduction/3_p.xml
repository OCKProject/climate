<p class="p">Coastal ecosystems are expected to be exposed to the increased risk of experiencing adverse consequences related to climate change and exacerbated by rising sea level (Nicholls et al.,
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Valle et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), while it is still unclear how coastal ecosystems respond to them. It is possible that in coastal ecosystems, native species will decline due to their poor adaptability to these threats (Mendoza‐Gonzalez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, invasive exotic species may take the opportunity to expand their habitats and stabilize their colonial status. So, understanding how invasive coastal species respond to climate change and sea level rise is becoming an urgent challenge (Brierley &amp; Kingsford,
