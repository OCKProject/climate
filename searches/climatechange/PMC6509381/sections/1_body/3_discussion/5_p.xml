Our results showed that habitats in Shandong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula will increase due to pure effects of climate change, while that of Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, and the Yangtze River Estuary will decrease. Therefore, we should pay attention to the distribution of

The changed habitats caused by shared and coupling effects mainly distributed in the landward side. It is because sea level rise will cause species, especially invasive species, to migrate to the landward side (Kebede &amp; Mokrech,
