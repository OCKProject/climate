<p class="p">It is recognized that climate change and sea level rise affect the species’ habitats (Cazenave &amp; Cozannet,

 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, our results showed that habitats change was mainly caused by the pure effects of climate change. Climate change could not only exacerbate the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic>, but also cause its habitats reduction, especially on the northern Chinese coast. Pure effects of sea level rise were by far lower than that of climate change. The results differ from Hester's (
 <xref rid="ece35129-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that sea level rise will be dominant drivers in structuring 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> coastal wetlands and 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> is very sensitive to it. This discrepancy could be attributed to their research did not distinguish pure effects of sea level rise and interactions with other factors, and thus may overestimate the impact of sea level rise.
