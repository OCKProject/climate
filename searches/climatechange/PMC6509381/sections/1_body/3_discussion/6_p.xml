<p class="p">Overall, our findings illustrated that the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> was controlled not only by the pure effects of climate changes and sea level rise, but also by the shared and coupling effects caused by their interactions in different regions. Thus, climate changes, sea level rise, and their interactions should be taken into consideration for robust predictions of the spatial distribution patterns of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic>. It will provide more scientific and reasonable suggestions for preventing and controlling the invasion of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic>.
