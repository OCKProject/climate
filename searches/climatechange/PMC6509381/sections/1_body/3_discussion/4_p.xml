<p class="p">Our studies also showed that habitats change was influenced not only by pure effects of climate change and sea level rise but also by shared and coupling effects of their interactions, which is similar with the previous studies that habitats change was influenced by their interactions in a complex manner (Hering et al.,

So, if interactions were ignored, the influences of climate change and sea level rise may be underestimated (Hering et al.,
