<p class="p">As shown in Table

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, while decreased by 9,628 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. 87.41% of habitats increment can be interpreted as being caused by pure effects of climate change, while only 0.53% by pure effects of sea level rise, 3.47% by shared effects, and 8.60% by coupling effects. For habitats reduction, the proportion caused by pure effects of climate change, pure effects of sea level rise, shared effects, and coupling effects accounted for 95.23%, 0.36%, 2.49%, and 1.91%, respectively. Pure effects of climate change mainly explained habitats change, while pure effects of sea level rise were quite low for whether habitats increment or reduction. Shared and coupling effects could explain 12.07% of habitats increment and only 4.4% of habitats reduction, which meant that the increased habitats were more deeply affected by interactions than the decreased habitats.
