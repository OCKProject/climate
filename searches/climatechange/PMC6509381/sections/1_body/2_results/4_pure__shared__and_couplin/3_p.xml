<p class="p">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="ece35129-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, on the southern Chinese coast, the habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> increased by 69,417 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, while decreased by 4,580 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. It indicated that habitats will greatly increase in the future. 78.86% of habitats increment could be interpreted as being caused by pure effects of climate change, 1.25% by pure effects of sea level rise, 0.99% and 18.90% by shared and coupling effects, respectively. For the decrease habitats, the proportion caused by pure effects of climate change, pure effects of sea level rise, and shared effects accounted for 38.38%, 57.16%, and 4.45%, respectively. Coupling effects of interactions had no impacts on habitat reduction. Different from the northern coast, pure effects of climate change mainly explained habitats increment, while habitats reduction were explained by pure effects of sea level rise. For habitats increment, coupling effects were much greater than shared effects with the sum of shared and coupling effects of 19.89%, while shared effects were greater than coupling effects with the sum of only 4.45% for habitats reduction. The interactive way was different, which mainly appeared as coupling effects in habitats increment and shared effects in habitats reduction.
