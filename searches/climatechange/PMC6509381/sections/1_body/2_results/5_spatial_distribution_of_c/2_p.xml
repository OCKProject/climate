<p class="p">Along the northern Chinese coast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35129-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a), the decreased habitats caused by pure effects of climate change mainly distributed on the Bohai bay, Laizhou bay, and Yangtze River Estuary, while the increased habitats mainly distributed on the Shandong Peninsula, Liaodong Peninsula, and northern Jiangsu Province. The changed habitats caused by shared and coupling effects were small and it mainly distributed in the coastal zone of Jiangsu province. On the southern Chinese coast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35129-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b), the increased habitats caused by pure effects of climate change almost occupied the entire coast from Zhejiang to Guangxi Province. We found the increased habitats caused by coupling effects mainly distributed in the landward side of Guangxi and Guangdong and by shared effects were very small. Moreover, the decreased habitats caused by pure effects of sea level rise and climate change, which were very small, mainly distributed in Zhejiang coast and Pearl River Estuary, respectively.
