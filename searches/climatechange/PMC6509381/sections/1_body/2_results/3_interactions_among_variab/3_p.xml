<p class="p">As seen from the Table 
 <xref rid="ece35129-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, on the southern Chinese coast, whether the 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic>, Elevation was by far the most important for the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> with the values being 0.8561 and 0.9294, respectively, which were much greater than those of the second most important Bio02 with 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic> being only 0.0658 and 0.1423, respectively. The 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> of Bio14, Bio19, Tgravel, Tph, Tsand, and Tclass were 0, while the 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic> of them became non‐zero values. Moreover, the sum of 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> is 0.9289 and the sum of 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic> was 1.3310. It indicated that there were still interactions among variables, but much weaker than that on the northern Chinese coast. Although the 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic> of Elevation were much higher than Bio02, the difference was as great as that of Bio02, which indicated that both of them had distinguished interactions, especially for Bio02.
