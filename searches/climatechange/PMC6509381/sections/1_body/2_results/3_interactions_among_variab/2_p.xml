<p class="p">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="ece35129-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, on the northern Chinese coast, mean diurnal range (Bio02), as well as elevation, had much higher first‐order sensitivity indices (
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic>) and total sensitivity indices (
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic>) than the other variables, which meant they were the two most important variables for the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic>. The sum of 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic> arrived at 1.6994, which was three times than that of 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic>(0.5096). It indicated that there were strong interactions among variables. The 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> of soil electrical conductivity (Tece) and soil drainage class (Drainage) ranked higher than their 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic>, while the 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> of Soil pH (Tph) ranked lower than their 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic>, indicating interactions reduced the importance of Tece and drainage, while enhanced the importance of Tph. Meanwhile, some variables (Bio02, Elevation, Toc, Bio05, and Bio08) had great differences between 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">T</sub>
 </italic>, especially for Bio02 (0.3663) and Elevation (0.2383), which meant that they had strong interactions with the others.
