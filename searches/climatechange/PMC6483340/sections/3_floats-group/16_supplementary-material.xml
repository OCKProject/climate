  <title class="title">Conditional inference (CI) classification trees.</title>
  <p class="p">Selected conditional inference classification tree predicting the response rates of survey questions using only predictors identified as important during the random forest variable importance evaluation step of the analyses (see 
   <xref rid="pone.0215511.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). For each tree, only significant predictors at p Ë‚ 0.05 were retained by the algorithm. Sample size used to build each tree can be calculated by adding sample sizes indicated at each terminal node. The classification accuracy was calculated for each tree using a subset of 20% the dataset.
