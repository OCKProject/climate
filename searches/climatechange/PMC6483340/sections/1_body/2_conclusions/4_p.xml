<p class="p">For the third part of the survey, which focused on adaptation strategies to climate change, influential predictors were most frequently associated with geography (e.g. latitude, region), and the scale of the sugaring operations (e.g. harvesting method, number of taps). Interestingly, a very large majority of respondents would adopt adaptation strategies if they believed it would increase maple syrup production. These include forest management to keep sugar bushes healthy and resilient to climatic hazards, investments in new technologies to boost productivity, and new varieties of resilient and productive sugar maple trees. However, the most important barriers to the implementation of these strategies appears to be the lack of easily accessible information about the effects of climate change on maple syrup production, followed by the lack of financial means and technical support.</p>
