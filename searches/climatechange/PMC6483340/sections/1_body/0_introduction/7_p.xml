<p class="p">Unfortunately, previous surveys documenting maple syrup producers’ perceptions towards climate change all used very different survey questions and methodologies, and used either small sample sizes [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In addition, generalizations using previous surveys would underrepresent the views of Quebec’s producers, who are responsible for approximately 70% of the world maple syrup production [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Altogether, these factors prevent the establishment of a clear global picture for the maple syrup industry. Furthermore, because the impacts of climate change on maple syrup production are expected to vary geographically, adaptation measures to climate change could potentially be implemented differently according to regional specificities. Thus, understanding the variations in producers’ perceptions across a climate gradient is crucial.
