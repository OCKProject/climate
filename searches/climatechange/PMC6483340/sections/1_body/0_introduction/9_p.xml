<p class="p">The primary objective of this study was to examine the perceptions of maple syrup producers from Canada and the U.S. toward (i) climate change in general, (ii) its effects on sugar bushes health and productivity, and (iii) potential adaptation measures. For this purpose, we conducted an online survey addressed to maple syrup producers from all producing regions of Canada and the U.S. Because maple syrup production is highly climate-dependent [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], we hypothesized that maple syrup producers would generally be more sensitive to the concerns raised by the scientific community in relation to climate change than the general population. We therefore expected that maple producers’ perceptions would not be significantly related to their political views. Also, given the ongoing shift of the climatic envelope suitable for maple syrup production toward northward latitudes [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], we expected an effect of spatial context on producer’s opinions. More specifically, we expected that producers in southerly regions of our study area, being potentially more affected by climate change impacts than producers from more northerly regions, would have higher levels of concern about future climate change impacts on maple syrup production. Finally, as implementing adaptation measures can be viewed as costly for producers [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], we hypothesized that factors associated with the size of the sugar bush would be important in predicting responses rates for questions or statements associated with adaptation measures, with large-scale producers more inclined to adopt adaptation measures than small-scale producers.
