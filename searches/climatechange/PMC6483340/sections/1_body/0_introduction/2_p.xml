<p class="p">The sap volume harvested each season is determined by the harvesting methods utilized [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and most importantly, by climate. Indeed, the strongest and best-understood factor affecting sap flow is temperature: water uptake from the soil and sap exudation, which involves alternating negative and positive pressure in the trunk and branches of the tree, is favored by cold nights (˂ 0 °C) followed by thaws during days (~ 3–7 °C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Depending on regional climate, these freeze-thaw cycles occur between February and April, but the beginning, end, and duration of the sap flow period can vary widely from year to year [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The tapping season generally ends with bud break and the development of microorganisms in taps when temperatures become warm (˃ 10 °C) for several days [
