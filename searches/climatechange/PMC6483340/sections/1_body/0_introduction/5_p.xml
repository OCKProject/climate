<p class="p">Because of the close link between climate and maple syrup production [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], climate change is expected to affect the maple syrup industry. Anticipated changes include increased summer and winter temperatures, a decrease in snow cover duration, and a time shift in the freeze-thaw period [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Inverse relationships between syrup production and average temperatures from January to April in Northeastern U.S. states have already been detected [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The projections of Skinner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] indicate that warming winter temperatures will result in a shorter sap flow period if traditional tapping schedules are maintained. The results of Duchesne et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] are somewhat similar, but indicate that decreases in maple syrup yields could be avoided in Quebec if producers shift the tapping period 12 days earlier by 2050 and 19 days earlier by 2100. Finally, the study of Guilbert et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] projects a decrease of 7–11 days suitable for maple syrup production by 2040–2069 and 2070–2099 in the Lake Champlain Basin, and that suitable days will occur earlier in the season.
