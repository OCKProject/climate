<p class="p">In the past years, there have been extensive efforts to examine the variables that are most closely correlated with acceptance of anthropogenic climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis, Hornsey et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] synthetized the results of 171 academic studies across 56 countries and concluded that the factor that correlates most with climate change belief is political view. In Canada and the U.S., this factor is very important for explaining the acceptance of anthropogenic climate change, with conservatives being less likely to believe in climate change than liberals [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In the forest sector in particular, it has been shown that concerns regarding climate change vary with political views and geographical context (e.g. the province of origin; [

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. It has also been shown that forest managers’ beliefs about climate change are correlated with their willingness to try specific adaptation or mitigation measures [
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. These studies thus show that determining the main factors influencing maple syrup producers’ perceptions of climate change is very important for the identification of potential adaptation strategies for the maple syrup industry in the face of climate change.
