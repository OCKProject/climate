<p class="p">The survey was divided in three sections: (i) questions and statements about general perceptions of climate change (eight statements), (ii) climate change impact on maple syrup production (11 statements), and (iii) adaptation strategies to climate change (13 statements). For most statements, respondents specified their degree of agreement using a 5 or 7-grade Likert scale. For each proposed adaptation strategy, respondents specified if it was efficient, and if they planned to use it, or were already using it. For some questions, a Yes/No answer was collected. Furthermore, we recorded as potential predictor variables socio-economic information about the respondents (age, gender, education level, and political view), characteristics of the sugar bush (number of taps, age of the largest maples, harvesting method, years of experience in the maple syrup industry, someone to take over once retired, percentage of household income contributed by maple sugar business, investment planning during the next 10 years, and yield in 2016), and sugar bush location (country, region, latitude, and longitude). Because of the low number of respondents in many provinces/states, we grouped respondents according to regions as delimited by Murphy et al. [
