<p class="p">The geographic location of the sugar bush was another important predictor of response for questions and statements about adaptation (
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Only 23% of respondents from Canadian regions agreed with the statement that there are many ways to adapt to climate change for maple syrup production, compared to 43% of respondents from U.S. regions (Fig Y in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Respondents from these warmer regions within the study area were also more likely to identify the adoption of strong sanitation practices and earlier tapping as effective adaptation measures to mitigate climate change impacts (Fig AE-AF in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>), but less likely to identify liming and fertilizing as effective (Fig AH and AO in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). There is, however, a considerable contrast between the producers of the two countries regarding the best moment to implement adaptation measures: the majority of U.S. producers (67%) believe that it is necessary to wait till they observe the effects of climate change, while Canadian producers are much more divided on this issue (Fig AC in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>).
