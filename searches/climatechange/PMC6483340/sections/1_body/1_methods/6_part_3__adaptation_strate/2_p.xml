<p class="p">Survey participants were then asked if various adaptation measures would effectively allow maple syrup producers to adapt to climate change, and if they would like to use these strategies in the future (

 <xref rid="pone.0215511.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The measures most frequently identified as efficient by respondents were keeping track of new research about maple syrup production, doing sylvicultural management, and adopting extensive spout and tubing sanitation practices (heavy use of sanitizers and/or annual replacement of spouts to lengthen taphole viability and enhance yield). Less popular measures included increasing a sugar bushâ€™s number of taps, using maples adapted to future climate conditions, and tapping red maples (

When asked which adaptation measures they would like to see developed by the maple syrup industry, however, the two positively viewed measures were selecting maples that are adapted to future climatic conditions, and promoting the distinctive syrup harvested in the very late season (
