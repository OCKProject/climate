<p class="p">Producers using high vacuum tubing systems (&gt;20 Hg) were more likely to identify sylvicultural management as efficient to adapt to climate change (Fig AD in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>) and were already using sylvicultural management in a larger proportion (Fig AK in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). In addition, they were more likely to already be using strong sanitation practices already (Fig AL in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Producers using high vacuum tubing were also more likely to be tapping earlier in the year (Fig AM in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>), more likely to say they have a wide knowledge of newest tapping technologies (Fig Z in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>), and to already be keeping track of new research about maple syrup production (Fig AJ in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Finally, respondents using high vacuum tubing were more likely to agree that their business could quickly change its labor organisation (number of workers, and/or hours worked) following climate change impacts (Fig AS in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>).
