<p class="p">The last segment of the third part of the survey focused on the adaptability of respondentsâ€™ sugar bush, and barriers to adapting to climate change. Only a minority of respondents agreed that their business could quickly adapt to climate change impacts experienced through adjustments of labor, production technologies, or how sap is collected (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>), and the lack of technical support, particularly for respondents with lower sugar bush yields (Fig AV in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Finally, 25% of respondents identified their lack of belief in climate change as a constraint to adopting new technologies for coping with the challenges of climate change. This proportion was higher (almost 50%) for respondents at the right or center-right of the political spectrum, and respondents without high school diplomas (Fig AX in
