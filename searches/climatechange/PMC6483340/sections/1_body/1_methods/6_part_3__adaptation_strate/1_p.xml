<p class="p">Regarding questions and statements about adaptation to climate change, we hypothesized a significant influence of the scale of the sugaring operation on respondentsâ€™ responses, with large-scale producers being more inclined to adopt adaptation measures. We first proposed general statements on adaptation to climate change for maple syrup production (

For example, producers using vacuum tubing to collect sap were more likely to agree with the statement that new ways to adapt to climate change are needed in the maple syrup industry, and that they will adopt climate adaptation strategies that will increase maple syrup production (Fig AB in

Also, respondents using tubing for sap collection were more likely to agree that new maple syrup technologies will help mitigate challenges related to climate change, and that they would probably adopt adaptation strategies if they will increase maple syrup production (Fig AA-AB in
