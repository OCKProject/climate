<p class="p">For the perceived impacts of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g004" class="xref">Fig 4a</xref>), political view was also the most important factor determining the responses of survey participants (
 <xref rid="pone.0215511.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Respondents at the left of the political spectrum were less likely to agree that climate change impacts are happening slowly enough to let them adapt as the impacts appear (Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>), and that the projected impacts of climate change are exaggerated (Fig D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Also, these respondents were more likely to agree that climate change is noticeable in their region (Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Education level significantly explained the responses of participants for the statement
