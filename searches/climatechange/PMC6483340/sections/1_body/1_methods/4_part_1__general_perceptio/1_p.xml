<p class="p">Given the close links between climate and maple syrup production, and the close contacts between sugaring operations and the forest environment, we hypothesized that (i) maple syrup producers would be more sensitive to the concerns raised by the scientific community about climate change than the general population, and that (ii) their perceptions would be relatively independent of political view. Our results do not support these hypotheses. Instead, we found that surveyed Canadian maple syrup producers were a bit less confident that the average temperature on Earth is increasing (77.2%) than the general population of the Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic regions of Canada (81.1%) [
