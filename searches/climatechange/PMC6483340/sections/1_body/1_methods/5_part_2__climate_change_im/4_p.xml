<p class="p">A substantial majority (86%) of participants strongly agreed that maple syrup production is closely linked to climate, but only a minority observed an increase in maple dieback because of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). Regarding the beginning of the tapping season, 59% of producers answered that they have already observed its earlier occurrence because of climate change. A similar proportion of respondents agreed with the idea that this trend will continue in the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), but the proportion was significantly lower for respondents at the right end of the political spectrum (Fig W in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). For statements concerning the variability in the beginning of the tapping season from year to years, 63% of the respondents agreed to a certain degree that climate change has led to higher variability, and 60% agreed that the trend will continue in the next 30 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). For these two statements, political view was the most important predictor of response, with participants from the right of the political spectrum having less agreement with the two statements (Figs. T and V in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). Finally, only 29% of the respondents agreed with the statement that it is now easy to determine the best moment to tap maples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), this proportion being lowest for respondents from U.S. regions (Fig U in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215511.s003" class="xref">S3 File</xref>). About half (51%) of the respondents agreed with the statement that in the future, it will be harder and harder to determine the best moment to tap maples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215511.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>); there was no difference between countries (
