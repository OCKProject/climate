 <xref rid="pone.0215511.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], production in U.S. states in the southern portion of the maple’s range could be more at risk by the end of the century than in northern regions. For this reason, we expected a latitudinal gradient on producers’ opinions about the effects of climate change on sugar bush health and maple syrup production. Partly in line with this hypothesis, we found a few geographic variables had a significant effect on responses to some questions, but political view was also an important and significant factor shaping the responses, particularly with regard to future impacts (
