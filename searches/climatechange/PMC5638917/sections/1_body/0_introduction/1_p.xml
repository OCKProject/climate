<p id="Par2" class="p">The Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), 
 <italic class="italic">Bactrocera tryoni</italic> (Froggatt), is the most devastating pest of Australia’s $9 billion p.a. horticulture industry. Endemic to north-eastern Australia, its range expanded southwards following the planting of exotic horticultural crops
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. Populations now span eastern Australia from the Cape York Peninsula in far north-east Queensland, through New South Wales (NSW) and into the southern state of Victoria where its range has been reported to be restricted by low precipitation and temperature to the west and south, respectively
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. Qfly has also achieved serious pest status in the north of the Northern Territory

 <italic class="italic">Bactrocera aquilonis</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. In the west, the climate of Perth and surrounds are suitable for Qfly

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. Within urban South Australia, Qfly outbreaks have occurred due to the entry of infested fruits from other states
