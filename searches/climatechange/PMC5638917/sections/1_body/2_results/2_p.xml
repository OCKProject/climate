<p id="Par20" class="p">Our model suggested that approximately 23% of Australia is currently suitable for Qfly. Highly suitable habitat occurs along the east coast of Queensland and New South Wales, Victoria, southeastern South Australia, and southwestern Western Australia. Coastal zones of northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the eastern half of Tasmania have moderate suitability, while the arid/semi-arid zones of Western Australia and the Northern Territory are unsuitable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Presently, ~64% of the FFEZ, spanning 120,589 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> across the southeast of the zone, is suitable for Qfly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Of the 5,321 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of land throughout Australia classified by ACLUMP as horticultural, ~97% is currently suitable for Qfly.
