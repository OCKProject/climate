<p id="Par22" class="p">By 2030, ~25% of Australia (i.e. ~1,900,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) is projected to be suitable for Qfly under at least one of the climate scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Due to subsequent gains in suitable habitat, this may increase to 31.7% (~2,400,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) by 2070 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Importantly, 12.7 to 14.2% (~979,000–1,088,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of Australia is likely to be suitable for Qfly by 2030 and 2070, under all six scenarios. This includes most of Victoria (with the exception of high altitude regions), much of eastern Tasmania, south-west Western Australia, eastern Queensland and the northern reaches of Australia.
