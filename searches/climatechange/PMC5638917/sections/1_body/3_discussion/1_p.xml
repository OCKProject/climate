<p id="Par25" class="p">Our study revealed substantial consensus across climate scenarios that south-eastern and south-western Australia will remain suitable for Qfly, until at least 2070. Similarly, eastern Tasmania, an island state currently free of Qfly, was classified as containing substantial areas of suitable habitat under both current climate and all future climate scenarios. Depending on which climate scenario eventuates, there is also the potential for large swaths of inland Queensland to become suitable by 2070. While the level of threat that Qfly may pose to the FFEZ varies with climate scenarios, the south-eastern regions of the FFEZ are likely to remain suitable across all scenarios, as are most of Australiaâ€™s current major horticultural regions. However, the northwest FFEZ is projected to be unsuitable until at least 2070.</p>
