<p id="Par16" class="p">To assess current and future habitat suitability, we projected the final Maxent model onto spatial data for each of the climate scenarios. Continuous suitability predictions were then converted into binary layers indicating suitable and unsuitable habitat. The selection of a threshold for this conversion depends on the goals of the study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> and the extent to which false negative and false positive errors are tolerated when identifying suitable habitat
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. Following previous studies of pest species
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, we selected the threshold corresponding to the 10th percentile of suitability at model-fitting presence localities. Data were then imported into ArcGIS (v 10.4, ESRI 2016). Binary layers were stacked to produce a consensus map, identifying agreement in the suitability of a grid cell across the six climate scenarios.
