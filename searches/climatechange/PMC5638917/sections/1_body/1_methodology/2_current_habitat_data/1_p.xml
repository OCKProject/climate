We assessed pairwise correlations among these variables, and generated three sets of variables with Pearson correlation coefficients having absolute values &lt; 0.8. We supplemented the climate variables with data on soil characteristics, available from the CSIRO data access portal (

They describe, respectively, the distribution of highly weathered soils, soils with large amounts of organic matter, and low relief landscapes with soils containing abundant smectite (clay) minerals
