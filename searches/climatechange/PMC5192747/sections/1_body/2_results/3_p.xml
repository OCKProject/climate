<p class="p">There were varying degrees of support for an effect of environmental conditions on salamander behavior. Striped and lead‐backed morphs maintained similar seasonal and environmental relationships, despite predictions otherwise (predictions 1–4). Detection probabilities peaked at intermediate temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Striped detection peaked at 11°C and lead‐backed individuals at 10.5°C in the autumn. In the spring, striped detection peaked at 8.5°C, and lead‐backed detection peaked at 8°C. Confidence intervals strongly overlapped however, suggesting no differences between morphs. For both morphs, detection increased with rainfall during the autumn and spring (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). On average, both morphs had peak surface activity on March 25th in the spring and November 1st in the autumn (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). We found weak support for breadth of surface activity to be greater in the autumn (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), but the 95% Bayesian credible interval for the two morphs overlapped in 17 of 20 of the plot–season combinations, indicating no strong movement differences between morphs. The largest mean breadth of movement was from striped morphs in plot I during the spring 2010 season (4.22 m ± 0.346
