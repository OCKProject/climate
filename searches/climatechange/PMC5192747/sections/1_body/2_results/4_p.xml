<p class="p">We found evidence that environmental conditions may affect survival and growth. Overwinter survival was generally higher than over‐summer survival across the three plots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). There were no significant differences between morphs, but simple comparisons of mean estimates suggest higher overwinter survival by lead‐back morph and higher over‐summer survival by the striped morph, contradicting prediction 5 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32573-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). We did not find support for a strong effect of temperature on survival probabilities for the population (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Warmer temperatures had a mean positive effect on striped morphs (winter: 0.355 ± 0.416
