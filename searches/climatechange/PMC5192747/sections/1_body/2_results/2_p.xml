<p class="p">Over the eight field seasons of the study, we had 2,805 captures during 86 sampling occasions of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> and approximately 20 captures of nontarget species. We captured 346 salamander in plot I (114 unique individuals and 232 recaptures; 48% lead‐backed); 1,039 salamanders in plot II (249 unique individuals and 790 recaptures; 40% lead‐backed); and 1,420 salamanders in plot III (389 unique individuals and 1,031 recaptures; 39% lead‐backed). After removing individuals that were only captured once, our sample size for estimating growth included 2052 observations for 479 individuals.
