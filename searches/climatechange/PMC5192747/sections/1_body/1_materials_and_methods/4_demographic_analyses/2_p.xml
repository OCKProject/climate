<p class="p">Closed‐population robust design models also estimate apparent survival probabilities (are alive and do not permanently emigrate from study site), Φ, among seasons while accounting for temporary emigration (Kendall et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32573-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Prediction 5 predicts that lead‐back morphs would have higher relative over‐summer survival and striped morphs would have higher relative overwinter survival. For prediction 6, we estimate how each morph's seasonal survival relates to mean summer temperature (mean low daily temperature for July and August) and mean winter temperature (mean low temperatures during January and February).
