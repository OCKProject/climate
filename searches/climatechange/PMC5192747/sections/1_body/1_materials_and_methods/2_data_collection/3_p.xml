<p class="p">We measured two types of responses: behavioral plasticity in the timing, duration, and extent of surface use during the spring and autumn and demography, including the rates of individual growth and population survival. Our general approach allowed us to determine (1) the degree to which behavior and demography responded to environmental variability and (2) whether the two color morphs differed in their response in concordance with past research (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32573-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). To gain inference on our two responses, we used three quantitative approaches including mark–recapture (behavior and survival), spatial capture–recapture (movement), and nonlinear growth models (individual growth).
