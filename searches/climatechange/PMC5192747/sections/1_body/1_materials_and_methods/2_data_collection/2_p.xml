<p class="p">Between October 2009 and May 2013, we conducted capture–mark–recapture surveys for 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (Laurel, MD, USA). Three plots were established &gt;20 m apart in lowland‐deciduous hardwood forest under similar canopy conditions. Plots contained an array of cover boards (30.5 × 30.5 × 2.54 cm pieces of rough‐cut pine) spaced at 1‐m intervals, allowing us to effectively monitor 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> populations and movement (Miller Hesed, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Plot I was 20 × 20 m (400 cover boards), and plots II and III were 10 × 10 m (100 cover boards each). Captured salamanders were given individually identifying marks with visual implant elastomer, a technique that provides easily interpretable, long‐lasting marks (Gillette &amp; Peterson,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Gender, color morph (striped or lead‐back), and snout‐to‐vent length (SVL) were recorded every encounter and were independently determined twice to account for observer error. Environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, rainfall) were gathered from a weather station less than one kilometer away (2009–2012) or from a weather station three kilometers (2012–2013) from the study area. Although this reduced the resolution of our environmental data, the magnitude and direction of changing environmental conditions are highly correlated at such small spatial scales. We opportunistically surveyed plots 3–9 times each spring and autumn, ensuring a minimum of a week between surveys to maximize cover board effectiveness (Marsh &amp; Goicochea, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Plot I was surveyed from autumn 2009 to spring 2011, and plots II and III were surveyed from autumn 2009 to spring 2013.
