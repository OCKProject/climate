<p class="p">Another aspect of behavioral plasticity is the breadth and extent of horizontal surface use. Salamanders move to forage, find mates, and defend their territories (Petranka, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). We investigated whether morphs moved differently depending on season, with autumn being warmer and drier and spring being cooler and wetter. Spatial capture–recapture models extend traditional mark–recapture models to better estimate population density by accounting for individual movement (Royle, Chandler, Sollmann, &amp; Gardner, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). These models do so using the location of capture events to estimate a spatial parameter, σ. Morphs that exhibited greater breadth in surface use will have a larger estimated σ. Therefore, we would predict σ to be larger for the lead‐backed morph in autumn and larger for striped morphs in the spring (prediction 4; Table
