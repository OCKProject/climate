<p class="p">Predicting species' responses to climate change require key data on a variety of aspects of an organism's ecology including both demography and behavior (Huey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Urban et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our study shows that the salamander population is clearly influenced by environmental and seasonal conditions both in use of surface habitat and in individual growth. Predicted climate change—warmer temperatures and more variable precipitation (Hayhoe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>)—will likely be detrimental to 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> populations by shifting the timing and availability of suitable surface conditions. Additionally, we found that warmer temperatures dramatically reduce autumn growth, the most productive season for this species. We also attempted to characterize within‐population variation in behavior and demography, given it is a key mechanism for adapting to changing conditions (Barrett &amp; Schluter, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In our study system, we used a color polymorphism as a potential indicator of within‐population variation in climate change adaptive capacity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> color polymorphism may be linked to differences in climate niche; however, only one of our eight predictions, temperature‐dependent growth, provided moderate support for the climate–morph relationships. While some heterogeneity within the population can be explained by color morph, other ways of characterizing variation in climate tolerance are required.
