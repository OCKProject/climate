<p class="p">Two adaptive strategies arise. First, selection will shift toward behavioral or physiological traits that ensure survival until reproductive size is reached (i.e., demographic buffering hypothesis; Boyce et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Our results indicate resource availability will likely be restricted by future suboptimal conditions, so adaptive traits may be those that better secure resources such as suitable microhabitat. For many ectotherms, microhabitat can play an important role in buffering deleterious responses to climate change (Scheffers, Edwards, Diesmos, Williams, &amp; Evans, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the minimal variability in behavior in our population suggests physiological traits may become increasingly important. Other systems have shown physiological adaptation to warming conditions (spiders, Krehenwinkel &amp; Tautz, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; plankton, Padfield, Yvon‐durocher, Buckling, Jennings, &amp; Yvon‐durocher, 2015), but given the slower life history of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic>, it is unlikely that adaptation can occur fast enough. Instead, thermal acclimation may play a central role in how the species mitigate climate‐driven restrictions in resource availability (Seebacher, White, &amp; Franklin, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; but see Gunderson &amp; Stillman,
