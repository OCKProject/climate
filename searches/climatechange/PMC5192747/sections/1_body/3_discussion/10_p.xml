<p class="p">Our goal was to understand how environmental conditions influenced behavior and demography and whether the color polymorphism was useful for understanding within‐population variability among those relationships. For organisms like 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> that are dispersal‐limited, rapid environmental change may overwhelm plastic and adaptive pathways (Chevin, Lande, &amp; Mace, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). While changes in populations and distributions are highly idiosyncratic across species (Gibson‐Reinemer &amp; Rahel, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), our study suggests that projected increases in regional drought and temperature will act as strong negative environmental pressures on 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> population persistence both behaviorally and demographically. Our results also show that the next step is to characterize genetic variability in responses. Genetic variability is a main driver of adaptive capacity (Barrett &amp; Schluter, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), and although genomic resources relating genes to phenotypes for many species are undeveloped (Ekblom &amp; Galindo, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> is widely studied and will likely have genomic data available in the near future. Our study provides necessary information and insights as to how 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> will be impacted by future climate change (Huey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Urban et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Williams, Shoo, Isaac, Hoffmann, &amp; Langham, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and suggests how it, and other dispersal‐limited species, may adaptively respond to such impacts.
