<p class="p">We found large differences in growth rates in relation to season and environmental conditions. Growth is highest in the autumn and is depressed when salamanders are underground in the winter and summer (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Temperature variation during the winter and summer had clear impacts on salamander growth. Most importantly, hot summer temperatures affected growth in the autumn, with warmer summers decreasing growth by 1.5 times compared to our coolest summer observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In the autumn, striped morphs responded more negatively to warming temperatures, following prediction 7. During the winter, both morphs responded positively to warmer temperatures. Warmer winter temperatures may increase the chances for opportunistic foraging (Caldwell &amp; Jones, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>). Contrariwise, hot summer temperatures reduce moisture availability and consequently the leaf‐litter invertebrate community (food for salamanders) and may force salamanders underground or to microhabitats where prey and suitable conditions persist (Jaeger,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>). Further, hotter temperatures increase energetic costs, which can slow individual growth (Homyack, Haas, &amp; Hopkins, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Regardless of temperature, striped morphs had higher mean growth rates during surface‐active seasons (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), suggesting that other factors such as predator defense strategies, diet quality, or aggression and territoriality may play a larger role in individual growth than environmental preferences between morphs (Anthony et al.,
