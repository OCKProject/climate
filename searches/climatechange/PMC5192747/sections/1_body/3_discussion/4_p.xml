<p class="p">Our seasonal estimates of survival show that mortality was generally greater during the summer than the winter (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). In the southern portion of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> range where our study takes place, it is likely that desiccation and heat stress in the summer is a greater driver of mortality than cold stress during the winter. Predation, breeding, and competition also likely contribute to the differences between summer and winter survival. Many salamander predators are in torpor during the winter (e.g., garter snake,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> are also territorial, and antagonistic interactions for desirable microhabitat during the summer may impact demography, as they can result in the loss of a tail (Mathis, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Schieltz, Haywood, &amp; Marsh, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Lastly, breeding may lower summer survival because clutch‐laying females may brood their clutch until their energy reserves are depleted (Yurewicz &amp; Wilbur, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Between morphs, we found slight evidence for mean lead‐backed summer survival to be lower than mean striped summer survival (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Rather than being climate driven, this is might be because lead‐back morphs have poorer quality diets (Anthony et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), are more submissive to striped morphs (Reiter, Anthony, &amp; Hickerson, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and have poorer quality territories (Paluh, Eddy, Ivanov, Hickerson, &amp; Anthony, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Striped morphs are also more territorial and aggressive, which may prevent lead‐backed morphs from finding necessary refugia during the summer (Reiter et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). When conditions become stressful during the summer, their survival may be negatively affected the most.
