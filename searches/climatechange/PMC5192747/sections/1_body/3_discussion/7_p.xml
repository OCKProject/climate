<p class="p">One of the most coherent responses to climate change is shifts in species' range distributions (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Dispersal‐limited species are less likely to exhibit range shifts and more likely must persist or witness range contractions (Midgley, Hughes, Thuiller, &amp; Rebelo, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Our results on the 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> population may illuminate strategies for how dispersal‐limited species at large may persist. Behaviorally, our results add to the evidence that shifts in phenology, in order to match optimal conditions, are a likely response to climate change (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>); however, the demographic costs to changes in phenology remain unexplored in many systems (Miller‐Rushing, Høye, Inouye, &amp; Post, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Our study suggests that even with possible changes in phenology, increasing summer temperatures will still likely reduce individual growth. Consequently, it could take longer for salamanders to become sexually mature (Nagel, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>; Sayler, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1966</xref>).
