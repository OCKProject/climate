<p class="p">A second adaptive pathway may select life‐history strategies that invest in reproduction at smaller sizes and younger ages. Variation in size at reproductive maturity already exists in many salamander populations (Peterman, Crawford, &amp; Hocking,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>); however, “hastening” their life history, while providing more opportunities to reproduce, may reduce overall fecundity as smaller size correlates to fewer eggs per clutch in some salamander populations (Petranka, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Other systems also show similar life‐history responses to climate change, including birds (Winkler, Dunn, &amp; McCulloch, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), lizards (Bestion et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and annual plants (Franks &amp; Weis, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Shifts in life history may be a key response to climate change for dispersal‐limited species, but it is unclear whether such a shift is sufficient for populations to persist.
