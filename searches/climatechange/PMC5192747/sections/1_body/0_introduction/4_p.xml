<p class="p">Phenotypic plasticity can mediate the response wildlife have to anthropogenic stressors (Hendry, Farrugia, &amp; Kinnison, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Behavioral plasticity, particularly in the timing, patterns, or extent of activity, is one of the most rapid phenotypic responses to novel conditions. These responses immediately affect the environmental conditions to which an individual is exposed (Snell‐Rood, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wong &amp; Candolin, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). When responses are adaptive, behavioral plasticity can help a species or populations avoid the consequences of climate change. For example, some turtles are able to shift nest‐site selection to avoid detrimental warming conditions (Refsnider &amp; Janzen, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Behavioral responses can minimize short‐term impacts and may provide a mechanism for future adaptation via generation of novel traits (Gomez‐Mestre &amp; Jovani,
