<p class="p">Species' responses to shifting climate will be driven by a combination of ecological and evolutionary processes; however, predicting species' responses to climate change remains a challenging endeavor (Huey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Common methods for future range predictions ignore both the constraints, such as movement rates, and the adaptive capacity that influence how species respond to changes in their environment (Kearney &amp; Porter, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Thomas, Cameron, &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Multiple pathways exist for species to respond to climate change: dispersing into new habitats, evolving in response to changing conditions, ameliorating stressors via phenotypic plasticity, or going locally extinct (Lande &amp; Shannon, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Sinervo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). While there is evidence that some species may be able to track their climate niche through time (Tingley, Monahan, Beissinger, &amp; Moritz, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), it is unclear how less mobile species will respond to changing conditions. For dispersal‐limited species, including many amphibians (Gibbons et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; but see Smith &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), environmental plasticity and evolution are crucial components of adaptive change because potential to respond in the near‐term through sufficient movement is limited, especially in fragmented landscapes (Cushman, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ruiz‐Aravena et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Without dispersal, persistence will depend on the interplay of local demographic responses to climate and the degree to which negative responses can be minimized by plasticity and evolutionary adaptation.
