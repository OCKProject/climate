<p class="p">We use 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> as a model organism for investigating within‐population variation in demography and behavioral plasticity in response to environmental conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32573-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). As a proxy for within‐population variation in climate tolerance, we use the color polymorphism described above. Characterizing and understanding within‐population variation, particularly for traits tied to climate tolerance, should allow us to better understand the adaptive capacity of the species. Our goals were (1) to determine the extent to which 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> surface activity and demography are impacted by environmental variation in temperature and precipitation and (2) to evaluate the validity of the color polymorphism as a mechanism for illuminating within‐population variation in climate response. We focus on the interaction between demographic and behavioral responses to environmental conditions. By simultaneously investigating plasticity and demography, we can improve predictions of how a species might adapt through within‐population variation, and we can use this relationship to determine how populations might be impacted by predicted climate change.
