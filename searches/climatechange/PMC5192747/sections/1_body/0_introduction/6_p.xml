<p class="p">To evaluate within‐population variability, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cinereus</italic> have a genetically inherited (Highton, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1959</xref>) color polymorphism that has previously been tied to differences in environmental tolerance. Although the direct mechanism remains elusive, this relationship between color and climate niche may be due to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium, but even the exact mode of inheritance is still unknown (Highton, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1959</xref>). Evidence suggests the two most common color polymorphisms—the striped morph and lead‐backed morph—respond differently to climatic drivers. Physiologically, lead‐backed morphs had lower metabolic rates compared to striped morphs (Moreno, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>; Petruzzi, Niewiarowski, &amp; Moore, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Behaviorally, lead‐backed salamanders appear on the surface more during warmer temperatures, suggesting lower metabolic rates support higher tolerance of warm conditions (Anthony, Venesky, &amp; Hickerson, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lotter &amp; Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>; Moreno, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Perhaps as a result of these differences, the frequency of both morphs varies geographically, with striped morphs more common in cooler, wetter regions and the lead‐backed more common in warmer, drier regions (Fisher‐Reid, Engstrom, Kuczynski, Stephens, &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gibbs &amp; Karraker, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Lotter &amp; Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest striped morphs prefer cool‐wet conditions and that lead‐backed morphs can better tolerate warm‐dry conditions. However, these climate–morph relationships have not been consistent (Petruzzi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and recent work has criticized the use of the color polymorphism for understanding climate relationships (Moore &amp; Ouellet, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
