<p class="p">At a basic level, predicting population persistence under climate change requires an understanding of the degree to which demography—growth, abundance, survival, recruitment, and emigration/immigration (Hanski &amp; Gilpin,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>)—is influenced by environmental factors. Connecting climate change to shifts in demographic rates can be challenging (McCain, Szewczyk, &amp; Bracy Knight, 
 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), but there is growing evidence that climate change can alter vital rates for the worse, resulting in increased risk of population extinction (Barbraud &amp; Weimerskirch,

 <xref rid="ece32573-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed experimental warming reduced adult survival in a common European lizard species. This resulted in lizard life history favoring earlier production of offspring in face of reduced life span. Despite this adaptive life‐history shift, a large portion of the species' populations are still predicted to go extinct before mid‐century (Bestion et al.,
