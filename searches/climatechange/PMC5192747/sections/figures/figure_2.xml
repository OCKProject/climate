  <p class="p">Surface detection as a function of soil temperature (a), rainfall (b), and calendar day (c) for 
   <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> in Laurel, MD, USA. Spring (left) and autumn (right) detection functions are plotted for both morphs. Mean striped morph (solid) and mean lead‐backed morph (dashed) estimates are represented by lines. 95% confidence intervals are represented by shaded regions (striped = dark, lead‐backed = light). Both temperature and rainfall influence surface detection, leading to bimodal surface activity patterns
