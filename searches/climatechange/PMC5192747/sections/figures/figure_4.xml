  <p class="p">Estimates for overwinter (“W”) and over‐summer (“S”) survival probabilities in all three plots (“1”, “2”, and “3”; a) and survival probability as a function of mean winter temperature (b) for 
   <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> in Laurel, MD, USA. (a) For plots 2 and 3, there were differences between summer and winter survival. Across plots and seasons, there were no clear differences between morphs (striped = black, lead‐backed = gray; squares = means, segments = 95% confidence intervals). (b) Striped mean survival (solid, with 95% CI) is not different from lead‐backed mean survival (dashed, with 95% CI). Both morphs exhibit relationships not different from zero. There was little summer variation in temperature, so no figure is provided
