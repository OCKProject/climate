  <p class="p">The impact of temperature on the growth coefficient for 
   <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> in Laurel, MD, USA. In the autumn, mean growth declines as the previous summer's temperature increases for striped morphs (solid) and lead‐backed morphs (dashed). In the winter, increases for both morphs. In the spring, there were no strong relationships. Lastly, summer growth remained constantly low despite warming temperatures. Means are lines with 95% Bayesian credible intervals as shaded regions (striped = dark, lead‐backed = light)
