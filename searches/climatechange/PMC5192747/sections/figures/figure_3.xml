  <p class="p">Breadth of surface space use across seasons (“A” autumn and year, “S” spring and year) for 
   <italic class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</italic> in Laurel, MD, USA. Mean striped morph space use (black, with 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]) and mean lead‐backed morph space use (gray, with 95% BCI) do not exhibit any consistent patterns or trends between morphs. The first two seasons have large credible intervals, resulting from fewer survey occasions within those seasons
