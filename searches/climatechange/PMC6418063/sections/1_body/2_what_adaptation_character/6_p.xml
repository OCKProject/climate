<p id="Par26" class="p">Temporal variations in the nature of adaptation options and decisions were only included in a few models (27% of land system models and 18% of water system modelsâ€”Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and generally via changes in socio-economic or productive context rather than the adaptive process itself. However, these changes were tightly constrained, generally being linear in nature up to some subjective maximum, and applied uniformly across the population of modelled actors. However, the application of most models to artificially isolated timeslices (which disconnect the baseline and a future time period, rather than simulating the full transient behaviour from the beginning of the baseline period through to the end of the future period) make these limitations hard to avoid, as well as eroding the distinction between anticipatory and reactive adaptation.
