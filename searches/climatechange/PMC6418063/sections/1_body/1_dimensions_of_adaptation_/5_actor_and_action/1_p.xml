<p id="Par10" class="p">The identity of the adapting actor often implies a great deal about the form, timescale, objective and scale of the adaptation process. It can be useful to differentiate between adaptation measures that involve international bodies, governments (at multiple scales), private sector businesses, NGOs, formal and informal institutions, local communities and individuals (Keskitalo

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2011</xref>). These actors can undertake adaptation for the benefit of themselves or of others, with beneficiaries sometimes divided between private and public sectors (Adger et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2012</xref>). Furthermore, different types of action are available to these different actors, including physical (engineering, technological), investment or market-based, social and institutional adaptation measures (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2007</xref>). Many of these actions are difficult to model, which may explain the lack of diversity in actors and actions represented in models (Brown et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2014</xref>; Holman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2012</xref>; FÃ¼ssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the real-world range of actors involved in adaptation makes it important that models can include many types, with clear identification and justification of choices made.
