 <italic class="italic">Effectiveness</italic> can then be determined, in the context of these different constraints, according to the uptake of adaptive measures. Uptake can be evaluated not only through direct outcomes, but also through efficiencies of scale (Bizikova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>), although it is likely that the effectiveness of adaptation measures at a regional or national scale will be less than suggested by local bottom-up studies (Patt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, the dependency of uptake on social and economic conditions, which may change under different socio-economic futures (e.g. Oâ€™Neill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2017</xref>), adds temporal dynamism that models may struggle to account for (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2005</xref>).
