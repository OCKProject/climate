<p id="Par12" class="p">The capacity to adapt depends largely on contextual factors, which may include economic and natural resources, social networks, entitlements, institutions and governance, human resources, knowledge and technology (Schneider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2000</xref>; Brooks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2005</xref>; Moser and Ekstrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2010</xref>). While these factors can become all-encompassing at a general level, they do have consistent characteristics across cases. 
 <italic class="italic">Economic constraints</italic> are some of the greatest obstacles to real-world adaptation (World Bank

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>), both in their own right and in their implications for the use of (i.e. capacity to operate, finance and maintain) technology (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2007</xref>). More direct 
 <italic class="italic">technological constraints</italic> can block the capacity to implement many adaptation options (Smit and Pilifosova 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2003</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Knowledge constraints</italic> can limit recognition of the need for adaptation and undermine the selection and operation of adaptation options (Milfont

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2008</xref>; Blennow and Persson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2009</xref>), while education and the provision of accessible climate information both facilitate more effective adaptation planning (Milfont
