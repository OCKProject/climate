<p id="Par7" class="p">Adaptation may be triggered as a response to a potential (anticipated) or actual (reactive) impact threshold being breached. Commonly, such a threshold would be defined with respect to the range of impacts to be expected based on historical experience. Exceedance of a threshold may have positive or negative consequences, representing opportunities or threats. Given the multiplicity of potential adaptations, triggers and objectives (Tompkins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2010</xref>), there is a widespread lack of clarity about how objectives determine the selection of adaptation options and their ultimate success or failure (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2005</xref>; Preston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2011</xref>). Depending on the objectives in question, successful adaptation for one individual, group, organisation or government may have negative externalities and spillover effects at other spatial and temporal scales, increasing impacts on others or reducing their capacity to adapt (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2005</xref>; FÃ¼ssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, it is also essential to consider the temporal and spatial extent of particular objectives and adaptations.
