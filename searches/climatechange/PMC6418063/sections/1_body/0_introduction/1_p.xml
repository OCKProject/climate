<p id="Par2" class="p">Climate change adaptation is an increasing necessity across human and natural systems, notwithstanding global efforts to reduce emissions, such as those stemming from the Paris Agreement. It can involve a broad range of short- to longer-term adjustments in social-ecological systems, the selection of which is influenced by interacting non-climatic changes, that seek to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities arising from the actual or expected consequences of climate change (Moser and Ekstrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2010</xref>). Adaptation is not easily reducible to theoretical or computational rules (Kandlikar and Risbey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2000</xref>; Crane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011</xref>), being framed by objective and subjective uncertainties about climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and the choices available to an adapting actor (Grothmann and Patt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2005</xref>; Travis and Huisenga 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2013</xref>). Furthermore, adaptation is bounded by real-world constraints such as resource availability and human and institutional capacities (Berkhout 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>) and can be complicated by the spontaneous and natural adjustment of organisms to changing conditions. Therefore, the design and implementation of adaptation actions requires a holistic understanding of how individual and societal reactions to climate change interact with biophysical, social and economic processes. Without this understanding, there is a risk that adaptation planning may produce insufficient or even counterproductive results.
