<p id="Par29" class="p">The fundamentally holistic nature of adaptation means that research needs to span a broad spectrum of issues that are traditionally studied by distinct scientific disciplines. However, while models have made significant progress in representing processes within systems or sectors, when applied in isolation they are not sufficient to address the complexity of adaptation decisions, which must account for feedbacks and interdependencies between those systems or sectors (Harrison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2016</xref>). This shortcoming is exacerbated by the lack of links and multi-scale comparisons between the models we review hereâ€”existing comparisons have considered only large scales such as European and global (e.g. Alexander et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2016a</xref>). At global scales, integrated assessment models that are ideally placed to trace cross-sectoral effects of climate change and adaptations, and to incorporate local responses to global drivers, rarely do so (Sohngen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2001</xref>; Rose 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2014</xref>). Meanwhile, local-scale models of specific adaptations or social processes neglect rigorous explorations of external pressures (Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2017</xref>); a particular problem with agent-based models that become more difficult to implement and interpret as their complexity increases. In both cases, recent advances towards model applications at intermediate (e.g. national-continental) scales hold promise for the unification of existing areas of knowledge (e.g. van Asselen and Verburg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2013</xref>; Magliocca 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2015</xref>; Blanco et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2017</xref>), as well as allowing modelling at scales more congruent with real-world adaptation processes and effects. In particular, the inclusion of specific adaptation actors and land or water systems that operate across regional scales is a necessary step forward.
