<p id="Par33" class="p">Equally significant is the inadequate exploration of the effects of socio-economic or climatic uncertainty on adaptation processes and decisions; a common shortcoming amongst the models we reviewed. Scenarios provide very different contexts in which to identify the ‘best’ adaptation options and will impose very different economic, governance and social constraints on implementation and effectiveness. Despite high-profile development of exploratory socio-economic scenarios including the recent Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs: O’Neill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2017</xref>), only a small number of scenarios are applied in most modelling studies. This gives a highly conditional and unrepresentative impression of adaptation options, especially where it enables apparent optimisation based on predictability of future impacts (Pindyck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2017</xref>). While a small number of studies allow scenario constraints to condition adaptation over time (e.g. Murray-Rust et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2014</xref>; Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>; Steinbuks and Hertel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2016</xref>), most are likely to overestimate the amount of adaptation that will occur within many scenarios and therefore also overestimate the benefits obtained from adaptation (Patt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2010</xref>; Harrison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2016</xref>).
