<p id="Par30" class="p">Similarly, there has been a notable absence of cross-sectoral or regional interactions in models of adaptation to date (Harrison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2016</xref>). We find several models that build on the obvious links between agriculture and water resources (e.g. Hayashi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>; Girard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">b</xref>; Vaghefi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2015</xref>; Mango et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2011</xref>; Arnold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2015</xref>), but extremely important teleconnections and links between pastoral and arable agriculture; agriculture, forestry and urban development; and levels of land management intensity are insufficiently represented (Seto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2012</xref>; Meyfroidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2013</xref>; Rosa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2014</xref>; Rose 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2014</xref>; Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2017</xref>). This precludes essential understanding of synergies, trade-offs and other implications between adaptations in different areas and sectors, as well as the ways in which these may mutually alter the long-term impacts of climate change and scope for adaptation (Warren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">2010</xref>). This deficiency also extends to feedbacks between adaptive and mitigative actions, which are generally modelled separately (Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2017</xref>).
