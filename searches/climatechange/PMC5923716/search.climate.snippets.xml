  <result pre="been undertaken to enhance the role of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda at national and global levels. Firstly, the"/>
  <result pre="Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability has examined the health impacts of" exact="climate" post="change in a standalone chapter since the third assessment"/>
  <result pre="published several extended series that review the health impacts of" exact="climate" post="change [ 19] and the health co-benefits of mitigation"/>

  <result pre="Thirdly, the health community has an increasingly strong presence in" exact="climate" post="change discourse, including at side events that occur concurrently"/>
  <result pre="Significantly, the &quot;right to health&quot; was explicitly included in the" exact="Paris Agreement" post="text. This inclusion constitutes the first time that health"/>
  <result pre="first time that health has been included in an international" exact="climate" post="change instrument since the adoption of the UNFCCC ["/>
  <result pre="Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has indicated that addressing the health impacts of" exact="climate" post="change is a priority under his leadership, an issue"/>

  <result pre="still exist that challenge the consideration of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda [ 63]. For example, the WHO acknowledges"/>
  <result pre="example, the WHO acknowledges that the health sector’s access to" exact="climate" post="financing remains minimal [ 8]. Additionally, a 2010 survey"/>
  <result pre="not been of great importance, but should be, in international" exact="climate" post="change negotiations and outcomes [ 64]. Further, in 2016,"/>
  <result pre="in Paris, but also noting that 85 percent of national" exact="climate" post="change plans still do not refer to health ["/>
  <result pre="health [ 65]. The limited traction of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda is perplexing, given the established biophysical limits"/>
  <result pre="projected costs, including health costs, directly and indirectly associated with" exact="climate" post="change [ 37]. Several solutions to address the discrepancy"/>
  <result pre="between the potential and actual traction of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda have been suggested. These include the need"/>
  <result pre="structures and processes on the uptake of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. In our view, further interdisciplinary assessment is"/>
  <result pre="more importantly is not, considered in high level debates about" exact="climate" post="change mitigation. 3. Materials and Methods A literature review"/>
  <result pre="relevant material for the development of this paper. Until recently," exact="climate" post="change and health research has been relatively sparse. A"/>
  <result pre="of the literature on the political economy of health and" exact="climate" post="change, the science–policy interface and power in the policy-making"/>
  <result pre="strategies to enhance their uptake in the development of national" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. 4.1. Discourse The political economy literature"/>
  <result pre="The political economy literature portrays the dominant discourses for both" exact="climate" post="change and health as unduly influenced by economic forces."/>
  <result pre="health as unduly influenced by economic forces. In relation to" exact="climate" post="change, for example, at both national and global levels,"/>
  <result pre="climate change, for example, at both national and global levels," exact="climate" post="change discourse is embedded in an economic frame, where"/>
  <result pre="that policy-makers have relied heavily upon economic approaches to solve" exact="climate" post="change by focusing on efforts to internalize externalities via"/>
  <result pre="4.2. Efficiency As an extension of the economic dominance of" exact="climate" post="change and health discourse, and in line with mainstream"/>
  <result pre="literature tends to argue that economic efficiency is central to" exact="climate" post="change policy decisions. Climate change negotiations are preoccupied with"/>
  <result pre="of the most comprehensive and longer-term economic cost–benefit analyses of" exact="climate" post="change—used a comparatively low average discount rate [ 6],"/>
  <result pre="intra-generational inequity remains a key issue in the development of" exact="climate" post="change policies. 4.3. Vested Interests An overlapping area covered"/>
  <result pre="Despite repeated efforts to demonstrate the economic efficiency of implementing" exact="climate" post="change policies, &quot;in reality governments inevitably get it wrong,"/>
  <result pre="of the importance of who wins and who loses in" exact="climate" post="change action. For example, in his thesis on the"/>
  <result pre="by Steves and Teytelboym (2013), whose comparative assessment of the" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies of 95 countries concluded that the"/>
  <result pre="of a country’s carbon-intensive industry was a major factor influencing" exact="climate" post="change policy adoption [ 85]. This has led some"/>
  <result pre="delaying meaningful policy development. Consequently, parallels between tobacco control and" exact="climate" post="change policies have been drawn by climate change and"/>
  <result pre="tobacco control and climate change policies have been drawn by" exact="climate" post="change and health researchers [ 86]. The role of"/>
  <result pre="structural and procedural challenges exist in relation to health and" exact="climate" post="change. Firstly, in relation to health, there is an"/>
  <result pre="address in totality many health issues experienced. In relation to" exact="climate" post="change, a &quot;web of stakeholders&quot; are relevant to climate"/>
  <result pre="to climate change, a &quot;web of stakeholders&quot; are relevant to" exact="climate" post="change policy decisions [ 95] (p. 1034). Included in"/>
  <result pre="explanations to understand the undervalued role of health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. We now turn our attention to considering"/>
  <result pre="barriers and opportunities for health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. 5. Discussion Applying insights from the"/>
  <result pre="from the literature on the political economy of health and" exact="climate" post="change, the science–policy interface, and power in the policy-making"/>
  <result pre="for the inclusion of health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. It is imperative that researchers are"/>
  <result pre="illuminate additional barriers for health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. 5.1. Discourse In a globalized, market-oriented"/>
  <result pre="policies. 5.1. Discourse In a globalized, market-oriented environment, the dominant" exact="climate" post="change discourse has focused on the shorter-term costs of"/>
  <result pre="undermined the role of health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies [ 49]. These barriers are exacerbated"/>
  <result pre="attributing and communicating the health impacts of shorter- and longer-term" exact="climate" post="change becomes increasingly challenging. The dominant discourse is further"/>
  <result pre="support the de-prioritization of health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. 5.2. Efficiency For many governments, a"/>
  <result pre="reduce local air pollution than to address air quality through" exact="climate" post="policies [ 12]. An exception to this view, as"/>
  <result pre="as mentioned above, relates to the Obama Administration’s pursuit of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies through air quality legislation in 2015"/>
  <result pre="While health co-benefits are accounted for in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies in the EU through the use"/>
  <result pre="undermine the consideration of health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. This is especially problematic given there"/>
  <result pre="between isolated policy goals of reducing air pollution and abating" exact="climate" post="change [ 100, 101, 102]. 5.3. Vested Interests The"/>
  <result pre="100, 101, 102]. 5.3. Vested Interests The structure of the" exact="Paris Agreement," post="which requires each Party to the UNFCCC to make"/>
  <result pre="creates winners and losers [ 96]. Longer-term, winners of ambitious" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies comprise nearly all sectors, including the"/>
  <result pre="that business and industry stakeholders are highly influential in the" exact="climate" post="change policy-making process as a result of corporate contributions"/>
  <result pre="Conversely, those who suffer most from a delay in effective" exact="climate" post="change policies are the most vulnerable populations with minimal"/>
  <result pre="extractive industry, strong ideological motivations have been linked to the" exact="climate" post="change denial movement that has particularly strong roots in"/>
  <result pre="and disdain of governmental regulations&quot; remains a defining feature of" exact="climate" post="change denialists, who appear determined to uphold the &quot;modern"/>
  <result pre="optimal for the development of a cross-sectoral issue such as" exact="climate" post="change, the politico-economic realities limit this approach in practice."/>
  <result pre="US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was responsible for developing the" exact="Clean Power Plan" post="and disseminating the health co-benefits [ 47]. Similarly, in"/>
  <result pre="provide in-house expertise and to advocate for health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda, often acute health care concerns are dominant"/>
  <result pre="outcomes, particularly for a cross-sectoral, longstanding policy area such as" exact="climate" post="change. For example, analysis of the United Kingdom’s climate"/>
  <result pre="as climate change. For example, analysis of the United Kingdom’s" exact="climate" post="policy development by Gillard (2016, 2017) determined that, in"/>
  <result pre="in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008," exact="climate" post="change policy was considered too expensive to pursue and"/>
  <result pre="pursue and austerity measures inevitably de-prioritized the implementation of ambitious" exact="climate" post="action [ 107, 108]. 5.5. Strategies for Enhancing Health"/>
  <result pre="undermine the role of sectors such as health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. Returning to Cáceres and colleagues’ four considerations"/>
  <result pre="and influence of health co-benefits in the development of national" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. First, aligning the health co-benefits of"/>
  <result pre="of national renewable energy goals is essential. Signatories to the" exact="Paris Agreement" post="have in principle committed to transitioning to low-carbon economies"/>
  <result pre="low-carbon economies [ 3]. As identified in Section 5.3, the" exact="climate" post="change action associated with this shift will inevitably produce"/>
  <result pre="benefits to energy security and health that result from ambitious" exact="climate" post="change action may appeal to policy-makers. In their multi-model"/>
  <result pre="an increasingly powerful alliance to be built between winners of" exact="climate" post="change action—such as the health sector and the renewable"/>
  <result pre="the first strategy, strengthening the position of health in the" exact="climate" post="policy community through the identification of several influential champions"/>
  <result pre="for health would greatly assist in embedding health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. Positioned across the private and public sectors,"/>
  <result pre="would need to be &quot;at the table&quot; or consulted during" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policy development. Third, developing and maintaining a"/>
  <result pre="the most important, narrative must directly challenge the misconception that" exact="climate" post="action is primarily a burden by firmly shifting attention"/>
  <result pre="many benefits, including those relating to health, that result from" exact="climate" post="action. Given the dominance of neoclassical economic thinking, highlighting"/>
  <result pre="thinking, highlighting the positive implications for businesses that arise from" exact="climate" post="action may enhance traction. The US EPA estimated the"/>
  <result pre="to utilize opportune occasions to communicate the health consequences of" exact="climate" post="change, and the health co-benefits that result from strong"/>
  <result pre="climate change, and the health co-benefits that result from strong" exact="climate" post="action, to both the politicians and the community is"/>
  <result pre="morbidity and mortality rates attributable to environmental risk factors, including" exact="climate" post="change (e.g., [ 112, 113]). Ensuring that robust, timely"/>
  <result pre="accessible for champions and other knowledge brokers at times when" exact="climate" post="change is thrust back to the top of the"/>
  <result pre="will maximize the prospect of firmly embedding health in the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. 6. Conclusions Current efforts to address climate"/>

  <result pre="Consideration of health, specifically health co-benefits, has been recognized by" exact="climate" post="change and health researchers as a strong strategy to"/>
  <result pre="health researchers as a strong strategy to encourage more ambitious" exact="climate" post="change action. However, evidence suggests that health co-benefits have"/>
  <result pre="insights from literature on the political economy of health and" exact="climate" post="change, the science–policy interface and power in the policy-making"/>
  <result pre="perspective on the challenges of meaningfully incorporating health into the" exact="climate" post="change agenda. Based on the literature, we identified four"/>

  <result pre="enhancing the uptake of health co-benefits in the development of" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. Our review of the literature identified"/>
  <result pre="the role of health co-benefits in the development of national" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. Secondly, as previously mentioned, there is"/>
