<p class="p">A literature review was used to identify relevant material for the development of this paper. Until recently, climate change and health research has been relatively sparse. A 2012 inventory of publications indexed in PubMed under “climate change” and “health” identified just over 1500 publications out of almost 20 million total citations [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Government and non-government agencies have addressed this gap by contributing to the literature with their own research and assessments. Consequently, grey literature, including several government and non-government publications, was identified and included in the paper.
