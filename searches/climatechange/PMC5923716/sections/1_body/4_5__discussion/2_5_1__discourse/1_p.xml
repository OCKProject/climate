<p class="p">In a globalized, market-oriented environment, the dominant climate change discourse has focused on the shorter-term costs of action and on “fair” calculations of burden sharing at the expense of meaningfully incorporating the costs of inaction into the policy-making process. This global framing permeates national levels of policy-making, where “economic growth remains so central to political legitimacy” [

Consequently, many national governments are beholden to the supremacy of economic guidance that focuses on least-cost pathways and the identification of the most “efficient” policy options. Further, in a policy-making environment where the benefits can be difficult (but not impossible) to quantify, it is simpler for policy-makers to disregard the qualitative evidence than to try and justify its inclusion in the policy development process. In Australia, a lack of domestic quantitative health co-benefits assessments has undermined the role of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. These barriers are exacerbated by the realities of perceptions around health; with individuals considered ultimately responsible for their health, attributing and communicating the health impacts of shorter- and longer-term climate change becomes increasingly challenging. The dominant discourse is further compounded by the reality that the policy agendas of health ministers are often “crowded with many demands, and influenced by competing and conflicting interest groups” [
 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] (p. 142). Such political realities support the de-prioritization of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies.
