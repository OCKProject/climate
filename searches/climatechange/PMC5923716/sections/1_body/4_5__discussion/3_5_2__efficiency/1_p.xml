<p class="p">For many governments, a focus on optimizing cost-effectiveness results in policy-makers pursuing health gains through direct policies. A notable example is in relation to air quality, where it is cheaper to implement measures to reduce local air pollution than to address air quality through climate policies [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. An exception to this view, as mentioned above, relates to the Obama Administrationâ€™s pursuit of climate change mitigation policies through air quality legislation in 2015 to avoid a politically hostile Congress in the lead-up to COP21. In the EU, however, health remains a primary justification for the pursuit of stringent clean air standards [

While health co-benefits are accounted for in the development of climate change mitigation policies in the EU through the use of IAMs, they do not significantly inform the final policy outcome. In Australia, health co-benefits have only been considered meaningfully in the development of national vehicle emissions standards [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The influence of health outcomes as a clearly defined justification for air quality policies is noteworthy, yet this can undermine the consideration of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies. This is especially problematic given there can be substantial trade-offs between isolated policy goals of reducing air pollution and abating climate change [
