In their multi-model analysis of the co-benefits of a suite of mitigation measures in the EU, Scwanitz and colleagues (2015) conclude that the immediate implementation of mitigation measures would see the EU reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, thereby enhancing energy security in Europe [

There is an opportunity for an increasingly powerful alliance to be built between winners of climate change action—such as the health sector and the renewable energy sector—to destabilize the undue influence of the extractive industries in the policy-making process.
