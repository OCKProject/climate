<p class="p">Firstly, some health co-benefits have been shown to provide strong and tangible domestic impacts, especially for developing countries, in relatively short time frames [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Given climate change benefits are often longer-term and diffuse, health co-benefits can attend to “the temporal and geographic mismatch between costs and benefits” [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] (p. 475). Secondly, and on a related note, while uncertainty still exists, some health co-benefit studies can provide a comparatively high level of certainty in the estimated benefits, an unusual advantage of health co-benefits given the uncertainty associated with longer-term estimates relating to climate change [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Thirdly, over the past two decades, numerous studies have quantified and monetized local, regional and global health co-benefits of mitigation policies [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Notwithstanding the controversy surrounding the monetization approach, these quantifications can be used—and have been by some Parties to the UNFCCC, including the European Union (EU) and the US—to inform the development of mitigation policies, supporting the consideration of health in climate change cost–benefit models [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to strengthen the role of health in the climate change agenda, including enhancing the role of health co-benefits in policy development (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-ijerph-15-00674" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref>). Despite these efforts, a gap still exists been the potential and actual role of health co-benefits in the development of national climate change mitigation policies. Several explanations have been put forward to explain the lack of political traction of health co-benefits, including a focus on cost minimization and research translation challenges [
