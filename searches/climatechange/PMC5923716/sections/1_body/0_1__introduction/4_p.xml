<p class="p">In this paper, we use perspectives from the: (i) political economy; (ii) scienceâ€“policy interface; and (iii) power in policy-making literature to support the proposition that additional barriers inhibit the integration of health co-benefits into climate change mitigation policies. Through an examination of the fields of literature indicated above, we identify four key interrelated areas where barriers may exist in relation to health co-benefits: discourse, efficiency, vested interests and structural challenges. As a roadmap for this paper, in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-15-00674" class="xref">Section 2</xref>, we summarize the health impacts of climate change and outline the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation, then provide an overview of some of the main efforts to enhance the role of health in the climate agenda. In 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-15-00674" class="xref">Section 3</xref>, we provide details of the methods used to identify the relevant literature. In 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijerph-15-00674" class="xref">Section 4</xref>, we stratify our findings from a survey of the literature into the four key interrelated areas. With the theoretical basis established, in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-ijerph-15-00674" class="xref">Section 5</xref>, we use the four key interrelated areas and apply insights extrapolated from the literature to health co-benefits. We then identify strategies that may enhance the consideration of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies. The paper culminates with suggestions for further research.
