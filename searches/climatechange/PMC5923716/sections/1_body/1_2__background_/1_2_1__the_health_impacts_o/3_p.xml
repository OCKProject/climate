<p class="p">Given the magnitude of current and projected health impacts, the health community has moved to highlight the potential health co-benefits that result from ambitious mitigation efforts. To determine the potential health co-benefits that arise from domestic and global action, complex modelling techniques have been created and are utilized by researchers, government and non-government organizations [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The broad methodological processes underpinning health co-benefits studies have been documented [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and several literature reviews on the co-benefits of climate change mitigation policies have been performed [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The findings are consistent; despite the heterogeneity of study methods, prospective health co-benefits studies consistently conclude that the implementation of ambitious mitigation measures can reap significant health benefits for local populations, and partially, if not completely, offset resulting implementation costs [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. A strong appeal of health co-benefits is their immediacy. Specifically, health benefits associated with reduced air pollution can materialise promptly after mitigation measures are implemented [
