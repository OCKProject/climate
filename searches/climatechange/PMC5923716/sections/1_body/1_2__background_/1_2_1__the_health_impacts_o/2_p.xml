<p class="p">Understanding the interplay among energy sources, climate change and health is critical to respond to the health impacts of climate change. Accessibility to energy has been fundamental for human development and progress. However, the dominant mode of energy production—the combustion of fossil fuels—has serious ramifications for human health across local, national and global scales [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The use of coal, oil and gas for the provision of energy results in the emission of climate-altering pollutants. Longer-term, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels contribute to climate change, resulting in direct and indirect health impacts as detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00674-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The WHO estimates that climate change will account for 250,000 deaths annually in 2030 given predictions for increasing incidences of malaria, diarrhoea, malnutrition and heat stress [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The WHO estimates that in 2012, seven million deaths were attributable to household and ambient air pollution globally [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The interrelationship between air quality and climate change is inextricable, with many air pollutants produced concurrently with greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Further, climate change exacerbates air quality issues, with projections of increasing premature deaths due to ozone and particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (PM

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. It is unsurprising that there are substantial economic costs attributable to climate change and air pollution. Estimates of the economic costs associated with climate change suggest that global annual gross domestic product (GDP) could be impacted by up to 3.3 percent by 2060; labour productivity constitutes one area that will be most significantly impacted [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Further modelling by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that the economic consequences of outdoor air pollution will result in health care costs of US$176 billion and 3.7 billion lost working days annually by 2060 [
