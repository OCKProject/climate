<p class="p">Over the past three decades, extensive efforts have been undertaken to enhance the role of health in the climate change agenda at national and global levels. Firstly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability has examined the health impacts of climate change in a standalone chapter since the third assessment report was released in 2001, with a dedicated section on health co-benefits in the latest assessment report released in 2014 [

 <italic class="italic">Lancet</italic>, has published several extended series that review the health impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and the health co-benefits of mitigation activities [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. More recently, the 
 <italic class="italic">Lancet</italic> Commission on Climate Change and Health (the Commission) was launched in 2015. Comprising a multidisciplinary consortium of researchers, the Commission provides specific recommendations to government to enhance climate action, and monitors, assesses and reports on progress of health in the climate change agenda [

 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Thirdly, the health community has an increasingly strong presence in climate change discourse, including at side events that occur concurrently to international negotiations at the COPs [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Significantly, the “right to health” was explicitly included in the Paris Agreement text. This inclusion constitutes the first time that health has been included in an international climate change instrument since the adoption of the UNFCCC [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Finally, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recently elected Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has indicated that addressing the health impacts of climate change is a priority under his leadership, an issue he reportedly discussed with participants at the Hamburg G20 summit in July 2017 [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. WHO’s commitment to integrating health into the climate change agenda saw representatives “engaged fully” at COP23 held in 2017 [
