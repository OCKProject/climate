<p class="p">While governments are ultimately responsible for making policies, it is well understood that the various actors contributing to the policy-making process use resources at their disposal in an attempt to influence the final policy outcome. In this way, “governments set the field of play and the rules for debate … but energy comes from actors on the field” [

 <xref rid="B90-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Accordingly, there are additional theoretical perspectives on who wields power in the policy-making process. Dahl’s (1961) pluralist perspective, considered the dominant theory in liberal democracies, understands power to be distributed among individuals and groups within society. The role of the state is to act as adjudicator in managing competing interests inevitable in the policy development process [
 <xref rid="B90-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Public choice theory extends this understanding of power in the policy-making process by recognizing the state as an interest group, with elected officials and bureaucrats pursuing their own self-interests, resulting in distorted policies that benefit certain groups at the expense of the public interest [
 <xref rid="B90-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Critiques of the pluralist perspective, most notably put forward by Bachrach and Baratz (1962), assert that power is not always overt; “much power is exercised more covertly and through subtle cultural processes…” [
 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] (p. 31). Bachrach and Baratz coined the term non-decision making to capture this concept, arguing that power “often is exercised by confining the scope of decision-making to relatively ‘safe’ issues” [
 <xref rid="B92-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] (p. 948). These analyses of the policy-making process illuminate the ways in which many actors, including experts and those with vested interests, can inform the final policy outcome.
