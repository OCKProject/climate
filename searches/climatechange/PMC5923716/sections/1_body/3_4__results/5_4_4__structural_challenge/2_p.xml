<p class="p">Cáceres and colleagues (2016) provided insight gained from their research in Argentina. The “science deficit model” maintains that low uptake of scientific research in policy development can be explained by poor communication of scientific findings by scientists to policy-makers, or the inability of policy-makers to interpret scientific findings appropriately; “it is basically a technical-communicational problem” [

They identified the “power dynamics model” as more representative; this conceptualization of the policy-making process recognizes that while pivotal, science knowledge represents just one element in a “highly contested, non-linear and multi-sectoral field where institutions, subjectivities, values, interests, power relationships as well as knowledge, play a role” [

Based on their experiences, the authors offered four considerations for enhancing the role of science in the policy-making process. Scientific knowledge is most likely to be incorporated when: (i) “it aligns with the interests of sectors that concentrate the larger shares of political power in society”; (ii) it is “encapsulated in compelling, widely-communicated storylines…well understood and appropriated by society”; (iii) “it has been appropriated by, and is well integrated into the agenda of a wide range of social actors with active representation in the negotiation process”; and (iv) it can “contribute to create or take advantage of social-political windows of opportunity” [
