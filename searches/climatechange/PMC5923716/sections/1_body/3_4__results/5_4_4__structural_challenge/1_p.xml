<p class="p">The literature identifies that several structural and procedural challenges exist in relation to health and climate change. Firstly, in relation to health, there is an acknowledgement that complex and dynamic interactions between various domains—political, economic, social, and cultural—inform an individual’s or a population’s health status [
 <xref rid="B93-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. These determinants of health often fall outside of what is generally considered the realms of the health sector [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. As a result, the health sector is limited in its capacity to address in totality many health issues experienced. In relation to climate change, a “web of stakeholders” are relevant to climate change policy decisions [

 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Researchers have considered the ways in which scientific knowledge can be used in the policy-making process. Schrefler (2014) proposed that the use of expert knowledge in regulatory policies falls into one of three categories: instrumental, strategic or symbolic. The 
 <italic class="italic">instrumental</italic> use of experts sees them engaged in the policy process to determine the best solution to a problem. The 
 <italic class="italic">strategic</italic> use of experts sees them involved in the policy process to support a pre-defined policy position. The 
 <italic class="italic">symbolic</italic> use of experts sees them contribute in order to strengthen the legitimacy of the policy makers [
 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Schrefler outlines a number of potential explanations for the exclusion of expert knowledge in the policy-making process, including that “pre-existing approaches to tackle and decide on a given policy issue are so entrenched … that expertise does not really make a difference when decisions are taken, particularly when these decisions trigger only small incremental changes in existing policies” [
 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] (p. 71). While scientific evidence does not always gain the political traction it warrants, there are opportunities to enhance the role of scientific knowledge in the policy-making process.
