<p class="p">As an extension of the economic dominance of climate change and health discourse, and in line with mainstream economic principles regarding resource allocation, the political economy literature tends to argue that economic efficiency is central to climate change policy decisions. Climate change negotiations are preoccupied with questions surrounding the economic optimization of emissions reduction and the distribution of responsibility in achieving this outcome [

There is recognition that, to determine “optimal” carbon reduction commitments, that is the most efficient policy option, economic instruments laden with neoclassical assumptions are regularly used as the basis for determining policy options. These instruments, often integrated assessment models (IAM) such cost–benefit analysis (CBA) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, are used to determine policies that are politically and economically pragmatic as opposed to optimal for environmental and social outcomes [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] by mixing “descriptive analysis and value judgements in ways that deserve close and critical scrutiny” [
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] (p. 299). The assumptions embedded into these instruments critically inform the final policy outcome, and are regularly contested (e.g., [

While it is not feasible here to review all of the contestations around modelling, two notable examples are worth highlighting. The first example relates to the “optimal” discount rate to apply to future benefits and costs. A discount rate is used to account for the discrepancy between current and future costs and benefits, by reducing the current value of a cost or benefit that will not be realized for a period of time [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Put differently, a discount rate “implies that the well-being of this generation matters more than that of its children, who in turn matter more than their children” [
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] (pp. 300–301). The discount rate used significantly influences the economic output that ultimately informs the preferred policy outcome [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], with far-reaching consequences for inter-generational equity. For this reason, the 2006 Stern Review—one of the most comprehensive and longer-term economic cost–benefit analyses of climate change—used a comparatively low average discount rate [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00674" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], a decision that was criticized by a number of economists [
