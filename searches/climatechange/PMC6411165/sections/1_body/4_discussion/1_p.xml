<p id="Par53" class="p">The ITCZ provides water to billions of people in tropical regions and any responses of the ITCZ to climate change need to be understood and accurately predicted. Large shifts in ITCZ location over Earth’s history have been recorded in paleoclimate data, but in recent decades it has been other aspects of the ITCZ structure that have been changing in response to climate change. Over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans the ITCZ has narrowed and its precipitation rate has intensified but the location has remained nearly unchanged. These observed trends are qualitatively consistent with projections for the ITCZ: Models simulate narrowing and weakening of the ITCZ circulation in a warming climate, but no robust change in location. Interestingly, we show that changes in ITCZ width and strength are strongly anti-correlated across models; this relationship can be understood by considering constraints on the atmospheric vertical mass transport. Uncertainties in the responses of the ITCZ to climate change are substantial, and reducing these uncertainties is contingent upon improving our fundamental understanding of ITCZ dynamics, and in particular the processes shaping ITCZ width and strength. The development of new conceptual insights into ITCZ dynamics will help targeted improvement of climate models and their simulation of the ITCZ, and may offer opportunities to develop “emergent constraints” to narrow uncertainty in existing CMIP5 simulations and in the impending CMIP6 simulations [
