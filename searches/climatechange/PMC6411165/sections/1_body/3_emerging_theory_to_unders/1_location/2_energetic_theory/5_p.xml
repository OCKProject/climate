 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>] has demonstrated that the inclusion of a dynamic ocean strongly damps ITCZ shifts (by a factor of approximately three according to one estimate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]) and reduces the sensitivity of ITCZ location to interhemispheric radiation contrasts. This damping of ITCZ migrations by the ocean is consistent with the muted observed and projected ITCZ location shifts discussed above. (For a detailed discussion of the role of ocean coupling in ITCZ dynamics, see the recent review by Kang et al. [
