<p id="Par28" class="p">The energetic theory for zonal-mean ITCZ location has been developed over the last two decades through a combination of new conceptual insights and a wide array of idealized simulations. This theory relates ITCZ location to interhemispheric contrasts in temperature and net radiative fluxes at TOA [
