<p id="Par34" class="p">The energetic theory, summarized by Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>, represents substantial progress in our understanding of the zonal-mean ITCZ location. A priority for future work should be to use this theory (and extensions to it) to identify the processes driving the inter-model uncertainty in ITCZ shifts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). There are a number of candidate processes, including model differences in interhemispheric contrasts in the radiative forcings and feedbacks that determine

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> −

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) and differences in the partitioning of a given cross-equatorial energy flux between the atmosphere and ocean. These processes are represented in climate models by a wide variety of components including those simulating cloud physics, radiative transfer, ocean dynamics and ice sheets. Only after identifying the dominant contributors to the spread in projected ITCZ shifts can reducing this uncertainty become feasible.
