<p id="Par35" class="p">On the theoretical side, there are opportunities to further develop our physical interpretation of the processes controlling ITCZ location and build towards a complete, predictive theory. The energetic theory for ITCZ location assumes the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux is due entirely to the zonal-mean Hadley circulation and that energy transports by transient and stationary eddies are negligible. However, transient and stationary eddies are not generally negligible in the energy and water budgets of the tropical atmosphere in both the observed climate and in models [
