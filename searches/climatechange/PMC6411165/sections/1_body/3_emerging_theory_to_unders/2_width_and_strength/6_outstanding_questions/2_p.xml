<p id="Par52" class="p">Most models predict a narrowing and weakening of the ITCZ under global warming, but do models in turn simulate a widening and strengthening of the ITCZ in cold climates of the past, such as the Last Glacial Maximum? If so, this may have implications for interpreting tropical paleoclimate data. The responses of temperature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>] and atmospheric circulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>] to climate change differ strongly over land and ocean—is this the case for the ITCZ width and strength? This should be evaluated, and if so, developing new theories and conceptual models to capture these land-ocean ITCZ contrasts should be a priority. Finally, in recent years substantial progress has been made in understanding the role of the ocean in controlling ITCZ location shifts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>] but how atmosphere-ocean coupling modulates changes in ITCZ width and strength is largely unknown. A first step towards quantifying the importance of ocean coupling would be to remove the thermodynamic coupling by analyzing fixed-SST simulations and comparing the ITCZ width and strength changes under prescribed global warming to the responses in fully coupled simulations.
