<p id="Par50" class="p">Ultimately, our aims should be to advance fundamental understanding of the ITCZ width and strength and to predict their sensitivities to imposed forcings, and these aims require an overarching conceptual model or theory. The energetic theory of Byrne and Schneider [

Theoretical progress on ITCZ width could be made by adapting theory linking tropical circulations to boundary-layer moist static energy and SSTs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>] in order to derive dynamical constraints for the latitudes of the ITCZ boundaries. Given the tight coupling between changes in ITCZ width and strength (Fig.
