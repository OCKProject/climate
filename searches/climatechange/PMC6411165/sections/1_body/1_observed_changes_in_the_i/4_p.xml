 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref> (see Supplementary Material) shows updated 39-year timeseries from 1979–2017 of ITCZ location, width, and precipitation intensity for the Atlantic and Pacific basins using GPCP precipitation estimates and the ERA-Interim reanalysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>] following the methods of Wodzicki and Rapp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Both the Atlantic and Pacific show no significant trend in the location of the ITCZ (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>a,d). However, this period is characterized by considerable narrowing of the ITCZ in both ocean basins (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>b,e). The estimated ITCZ narrowing corresponds to fractional changes in width of − 20%/K in the Atlantic and − 29%/K in the Pacific, where we have normalized by the change in ERA-Interim global-mean surface-air temperature over 1979–2017. This narrowing accompanies an increase in precipitation intensity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>c,f); these increasing precipitation trends are especially pronounced in the core of the Pacific ITCZ (not shown). Removal of the large El Niño–Southern Oscillation signal in the first half of the timeseries following the method of Wodzicki and Rapp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] weakens the significance of the trends, but does not change their qualitative characteristics. A joint analysis of cloud regimes and precipitation suggests that these patterns of precipitation changes can be explained by a shift towards more frequent organized deep convection near the ITCZ center and less frequent convection along its edges [
