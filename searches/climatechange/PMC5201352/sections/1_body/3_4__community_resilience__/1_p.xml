In its multi-scalar dimension, resilience is more direct and tangible in the individual/household level, and gradually takes on a more abstract and intangible form at larger spheres [

Thus, it is imperative for studies to clearly define and characterize resilience, the focused social level, and measuring methods. For example, as a global problem, climate change decision-making and initiatives come from the larger global, regional, or national strata, but are tangibly implemented at household or community levels. Communities are particularly important in conceptualizing social resilience because this level is at the intersection of micro-individual-household and macro-national-global levels, which can be downscaled or up-scaled [
