 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] points out a number of climate-related drivers that affect the global environment. The drivers include warming trends, extreme temperatures, drying trends, extreme precipitation, damaging cyclones, flooding, storm surges, ocean acidification, temporal shifts in seasonality, and resulting sea-level rise (SLR) and salinization of water and soil. All of these ‘signatures of climate change’ [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] have devastating repercussions on human livelihoods and communities. Human communities are negatively impacted by recent global warming in numerous ways, such as negative impacts on average crop yields and increases in yield variability; urban risks associated with water supply, housing, and energy systems; decreased access to water for poor people due to water shortage and growing competition for water; displacement, and involuntary and forced migration associated with extreme events; violent conflict arising from deterioration in resource-dependent livelihoods such as agriculture and pastoralism; declining work productivity, increasing morbidity (i.e., dehydration, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion), and mortality from exposure to heat waves. Particular segments of people, including homeless people, children, construction workers, and women, are more vulnerable to increasing morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. All of these current and projected consequences of climate change on human livelihoods have, in turn, negative impacts on overall community capitals—economic, social, physical, natural, and others. A community’s resilience to climate change depends on how the community withstands, and recovers from, climate shocks through its economic, social, and other community capitals.
