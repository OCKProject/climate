<p class="p">From the above discussion it is clear that a climate resilient community has sufficient assets and resources that facilitate its coping capacity with long-term changes. A balanced combination of various ‘community capitals’ [

 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]—enhances resilience of a community to disturbances including climate change disruptions. Community capitals are resources of a community that are invested for the collective wellbeing of the entire community. Social scientists frequently mention human capital (i.e., an individual’s innate and acquired personal attributes, such as work skill, education, knowledge, and health, which contribute to the ability to earn a living and strengthening the community), cultural capital (i.e., community’s worldview, values, and norms), financial or economic capital (i.e., material property, wealth, and other financial sources available to be invested for business development, civic, and social enterprises), physical or built capital (i.e., physical infrastructure of a community including machinery, homes, factories, water, roads, transport, shelter, and energy), political capital (i.e., community members’ access to resources, power, and power brokers), environmental or natural capital (i.e., availability and sustainable use of natural resources for human consumption), and social capital (i.e., the extent of social networks) [

Social capital may further be divided into bonding capital (i.e., close ‘inward looking’ horizontal ties of social network that build cohesion within a community), bridging capital (referring to loose horizontal ties of ‘outward looking’ social networks across various social and ethnic groups), and linking capital (referring to vertical relationships across power or authority gradients) [
