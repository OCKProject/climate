<p class="p">The scientific community is now overwhelmingly unanimous on the existence, causes, and impacts of global climate change. If we look at the cases of global warming, for example, we find that an unequivocal warming of the Earth’s climate system has been in operation since the Industrial Revolution began. Indeed, the last decade (2001–2010) was the warmest one in recorded history. Ever since the mid-1970s, the average global temperature has increased about 0.6 °C, almost 0.2 °C per decade [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that world surface temperature is very likely to rise by 1.8 °C–3.4 °C by 2100, compared with 1980–2000 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The IPCC in its latest Assessment Report (AR5) declared with 95% certainty that humans are responsible for more than half of the observed global warming between 1951 and 2010 [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Global fossil fuel burning is rising every year and if the trajectory continues, the Earth might become an unlivable planet by the year 2100 because of the consequences of rising global temperatures, which include rising sea levels, frequent heat waves, changed weather and seasonal patterns, frequent and prolonged droughts and floods, more tree deaths and insect damage, ocean acidification or a decrease in pH in ocean water, etc. From the discussion above, it is clear that climate change variability and extremes act as external stresses and perturbations to ecological and social systems and communities.
