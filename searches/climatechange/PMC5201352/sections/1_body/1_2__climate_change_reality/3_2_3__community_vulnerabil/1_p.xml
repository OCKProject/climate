<p class="p">A community’s climate risks and coping capacities can be assessed through two essential approaches: social vulnerability and resilience [

Vulnerability of a system, primarily from an ecological point of view, is composed of three components: (1) exposure to perturbation—the degree to which a system is in contact with the perturbation; (2) sensitivity to perturbation—the degree to which a system is affected by a disturbance; and (3) capacity to adapt—a system’s ability to adjust to a disturbance [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. An intricate range of economic, political, social, and physical factors jointly determines the vulnerability of a person or community. Scholars have differentiated between human and non-human components and distinguished between human, social, and physical vulnerabilities [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Thus, vulnerability is the measure of a system’s fragility with regard to environmental and other threats. Only a resilient community (more in the subsequent sections) can successfully overcome stresses including climate disruptions. Resilience is the long-term capacity of a system to deal with change and continue to develop [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Resilience to climate change of a community can be defined as a combination of resistance to frequent and severe disturbances, capacity for recovery and self-organization, and the ability to adapt to new conditions [
