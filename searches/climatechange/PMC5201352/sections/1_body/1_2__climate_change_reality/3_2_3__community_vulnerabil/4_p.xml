<p class="p">Cannon and Muller-Mahn [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] argue, opposing others, that a paradigm shift from a vulnerability to a resilience perspective is dangerous. According to them, “vulnerability involves a clear, economically and politically induced condition that theorizes the way that people are exposed to a lesser or greater degree of risk” [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]; while resilience, derived from natural or technological sciences and with a focus on systems (or ecosystems) approach, fails to grapple with human society’s socio-economic components. Despite few limitations of the concept of resilience—as delineated by Cannon and Muller-Mahn [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], for example—academic and policy attentions are now shifting from a vulnerability approach to a resilience perspective because the latter is viewed as “more proactive and positive expression of community engagement” [
