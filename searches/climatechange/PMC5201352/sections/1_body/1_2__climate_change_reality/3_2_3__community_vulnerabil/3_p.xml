<p class="p">The bottom-line of the arguments is that while both approaches can be applied to rapid and gradual hazards and changes, the vulnerability framework is more appropriate for addressing rapid onset events, like cyclones or earthquakes, whereas the resilience perspective is more suitable for addressing slow onset transformations like drought, famine, long-term temperature shifts, and sea-level rise. Similarly, both concepts are overlapping in the sense that although a community can possess characteristics that can determine only its vulnerability or only its resilience, it can have multiple socio-economic characteristics that influence both its vulnerability and resilience [
