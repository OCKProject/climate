<p class="p">The notion of ‘community’ is fluid and is a social construct that needs to be defined on a case-by-case basis [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] focusing on the specific area of interest of investigation. A community can be viewed as “an affective unity of belonging and identity”, “a functional unit of production and exchange”, “a network of relations” among individuals, and “a unit of collective action” [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Communities are composed of compositional (i.e., characteristics of individuals living in an area), contextual (i.e., characteristics of the area where certain group of people live in), and functional (i.e., mechanisms and processes through which a community functions) components [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In community resilience studies, the term ‘community’ has been defined variously, including the totality of social system interactions, i.e., an affective unit of belonging and identity, and a network of relations, usually within a defined geographical space [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]; any group of individuals that share common interests, identify with one another, have a common culture, and participate in shared activities [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]; a group of people living within the territorial boundaries of an administrative unit [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]; and a place-bound neighborhood as well as an interest or kinship-based social unit [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. A community’s most significant feature, in the context of resilience to climate changes, is its capacity “to collectively identify problems, take decisions and act on them and to allocate resources” [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Although it is possible to view communities in various levels of size and length from a tiny area of a village to a global community, generally, social resilience researchers locate community at an intermediary level in terms of a nested hierarchy of geographical scale, in which local community is placed above household level and below regional level [
