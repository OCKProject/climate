Later on, the resilience approach diffused in various social science studies taking an extended ecological resilience definition. During the late 1970s through 1990s, social scientists deployed the resilience concept in ‘social-ecological systems’ study. In this phase, the notion of resilience emerged as a ‘boundary object’ between the natural and social sciences [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Resilience was defined in this stream of research as “the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, and feedbacks—to have the same identity” [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The conception of ‘social-ecological resilience’ was still burdened by its substantial reliance on “deterministic and positivist natural science-based behavioral assumptions” [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] which is not always applicable to human communities and systems. Social scientists began to feel discomfort in using this framework for social systems because a social system incorporates structural, as well as agency, variables within it, while an ecological system is primarily built on structural components. Thus, the concept of ‘social-ecological system resilience’ is incapable of conceptualizing the totality of the role of human agency factors in the resilience of a social system.
