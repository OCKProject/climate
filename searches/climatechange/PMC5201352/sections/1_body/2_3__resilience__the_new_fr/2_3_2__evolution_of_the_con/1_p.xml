<p class="p">The concept of resilience has its origin in the sciences of mathematics and physics [

 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and ecology [

 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In its original usage, the concept describes the ability of an object or system “to return to equilibrium after a displacement” [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The English word ‘resilience’ has its origin in Latin ‘resiliens’ and its derivatives ‘resilio’ and ‘resilere’ [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In essence, resilience translates to ‘recoil’ [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] or ‘to jump back’ [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The earliest English usage denoted the repercussive qualities of sound, namely ‘resilience of echoes’ [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Later, the term was used in engineering science to mean the obdurate quality of materials. In the twentieth century ecologists grabbed the concept and during the last half century it has been in use in various disciplines. Thus, ‘resilience’ has now, in its ‘third wave’ [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], become a hot issue in sociology and other social sciences. Within social and behavioral sciences, developmental psychology was the first discipline in which the study of resilience evolved [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Currently, sociologists are contributing notably in expanding the concept of resilience at social levels.
