<p class="p">In order to overcome the inadequacy of ‘social-ecological resilience’, social scientists, after the 1990s, began to use the third strand of research focusing solely on human groups and communities by deploying the new concept of ‘social resilience’ [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Social resilience has been defined as the ability of human communities to withstand external shocks to their social infrastructure, such as environmental variability or social, economic, and political upheaval [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Traditionally, resilience theorists did not focus on power relations, politics and culture; instead, their emphasis was on the structure and function of a system. Social resilient theorists brought about the question of policy, political, social, economic, psychological, and ethical parameters into the resilience spectrum [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Social scientists now engage a ‘bottom-up’ approach in comprehending human drivers and indicators at the community level, in which human–environment interactions are only one of many constituents. One of the differences between ecological resilience and social resilience is that while the former is linear the latter is non-linear, in the sense that due to social learning processes and social memory social systems can never go back to their original status after a blow (but ecosystems may be able to do that). For a human community, social resilience can be both preventive to shocks through avoiding poor outcomes by developing adaptive mechanisms and curative for recovery after a traumatic or catastrophic disturbance [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Through its anticipatory nature, a social community may develop human adjustment processes that push the after-shock system to a new, and sometimes better, state—hence, at the heart of social resilience is ‘bouncing forward’ or ‘move on’, not ‘bouncing back’ [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Thus, the goal for adaptive capacity after a disruption would often not be to attempt to restore the original state but to “use learning processes and social memory as a basis for the creation of a qualitatively different more resilient community” [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. So, in this view, social resilience is both an outcome, meaning an upgraded coping ability of communities, and a process, referring to community-level dynamic changes and learning to withstand shocks over time and to take responsibility and control of their development trajectories [
