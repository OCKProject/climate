<p class="p">In between the hard and the soft systems there is a third category, which we can tag as ‘mixed systems’. Mixed systems resilience is a hybrid concept—a boundary object in which descriptive and normative connotations are intermingled [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This type of resilience lies at the border between natural and social sciences. We can cite social–ecological resilience and organizational resilience as two examples of mixed systems resilience. The social–ecological systems (SES) approach treats humans as part of ecosystems—the nature–culture divide is viewed as arbitrary and artificial. Adger and colleagues [

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] defined social–ecological resilience as the capacity of linked social–ecological systems to absorb recurrent disturbances so as to retain essential structures, processes, and feedbacks. Organizational resilience of business enterprises is another example of mixed system resilience. As an area of ‘corporate strategy’ [
 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], enterprise (or, organizational) resilience incorporates the ideas of risk management and governance processes: enterprise resilience marries risk assessment, information reporting, and governance processes with strategic and business planning to create an enterprise-wide early warning capability that is embedded in the business of the company [
