<p class="p">Contrary to resilience of hard systems, resilience of soft systems can be characterized as vague and malleable, normative, intangible, and hard to be quantitatively measured. The major forms of resilience of human and social systems that fall under this category include psychological, economic, and community resilience. Psychological resilience, developed independently of mathematical or ecological origins, framed resilience as an adaptive capacity of humans. In early psychiatric literature, children who could withstand high-risk circumstances were termed as ‘invulnerable’—and eventually ‘invulnerability’ was replaced by ‘resilience’ in psychology texts [

 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Humanistic psychology defines resilience as an individual’s capacity to thrive and fulfill potential despite or perhaps even because of such stressors resilient individuals seem not only to cope well with unusual strains and stressors but actually to experience such challenges as learning and development opportunities [

Economic resilience refers to the incorporation of the resilience approach into economic activities including “production inputs and outputs, demand- and supply side effects, inherent and adaptive abilities, and levels of the economy” [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] defines resilience based on ‘post-disaster conditions and response’. Rose also puts forward that resilience in economic sectors can take place at three levels: “microeconomic—individual behavior of firms, households, or organizations; meso-economic—economic sector, individual market, or cooperative group; and macroeconomic—all individual units and markets combined, including interactive effects” [

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], the threats may also be the result of a community’s internal evolutionary processes of vulnerability [
