<p class="p">Based on the nature of the response that a system generates to hazards or disturbances, Handmer and Dovers [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] suggested a three-way generic classification of resilience: resistance and maintenance; change at the margins; and openness and adaptability. The type 1 resilience, resistance and maintenance, is the most basic form. A social system of this type tries to avoid change, denies the existence of any problem, allocates resources in order to maintain the status quo, and does not question any underlying assumptions or power asymmetries in society. This approach is favored by the elites of society who fear the loss of their authority if any drastic change occurs in the society. Since this type of resilience lacks flexibility, a system containing it cannot adjust to new situations. Having this form of resilience, a system would collapse instead of transform. The type 2 resilience, change at the margins, is the standard approach to address disturbances. A system with this type of resilience admits the existence of a problem; acknowledges its repercussions; acknowledges the non-sustainability of the current system; and advocates reforms in a degree which does not challenge the societal bases or governance regimes. Thus, this approach, dominant in the West, addresses symptoms, not the underlying causes [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Type 3 resilience, openness and adaptability, is the deepest form of resilience which directly addresses the fundamental causes of hazards; and advocates major political and cultural shifts through transformation in over-arching political economy regimes and associated cultural discourses on development, risk, and security.
