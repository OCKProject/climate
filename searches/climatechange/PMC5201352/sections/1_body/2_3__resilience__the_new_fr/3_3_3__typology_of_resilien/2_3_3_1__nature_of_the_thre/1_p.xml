<p class="p">Based on the nature of the disturbance a system or a particular aspect of a system focuses on, Folke and colleagues distinguished between specified and general resilience [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. When a system develops coping mechanisms with regard to a specific threat, its adaptive capability is termed as specified resilience. For example, if a climate-challenged human community develops resilience in addressing the problem of salinity intrusion—but does not become resilient to drought, flood, cyclones, and other climate threats—its resilience can be termed as specified resilience. Specified resilience answers the question: “resilience of what to what?” [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Generally, the majority of the adaptation programs for communities designed by governmental and non-governmental organizations in developing countries focus on specific problems and issues which, in turn, result in developing sector-wise resilience. However, too much focus on a specific event or sectors can possibly lead to new kinds of instability of the system in facing a multitude of challenges. Thus, specified resilience is not holistic in nature. General resilience, on the other hand, is the resilience which a system grows in order to address all sorts of shocks simultaneously. This type of resilience program addresses all of the potential threats that affect the system as a whole or part of it. Thus, general resilience is holistic. Similarly, Begon and colleagues, using the concept of stability synonymously with the current usage of resilience, distinguished between local stability and global stability [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Local stability means the tendency of a community to reinstate its original state ‘when subjected to small perturbation’ [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]; global stability is the capability of a system to return to its original state after comparatively large disturbances.
