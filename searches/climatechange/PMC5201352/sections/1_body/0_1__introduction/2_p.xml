<p class="p">Adaptation and resilience literature has concentrated mostly on large-scale global, regional, national level scenarios of climate change and the recommended international-level policy options [

Since observed and future climate changes have, and will have, spatially- and socially-differentiated impacts experienced primarily at local levels, it is crucial to understand the community-level dynamics of climate disruptions [

Understanding how communities utilize their resources in effective ways to recover from the real and potential damage from climate threats is central to helping people plan for, and rebound from, environmental and climate disasters [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This article aims to contribute to the climate change and resilience literature through an in-depth and critical conceptual discussion of the exact mechanisms on how collective action and community capitals shape the degree of resilience of a geographically-bounded community facing both gradual and sudden changes in climate. Mapping the intersections between climate change, community resilience, and community capitals could provide essential information for policymakers in helping communities to avoid or withstand losses from climate hazards.
