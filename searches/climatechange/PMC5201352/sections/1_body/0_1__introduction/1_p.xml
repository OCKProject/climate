<p class="p">Over the last few decades, community resilience, as one of the buzzwords of the time, has gained increasing academic and programmatic attention from social researchers, planners, community activists, and development practitioners [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Since disaster risk reduction has gradually moved away from a ’predict and prevent‘ model, in the context of specific hazards, to building community capabilities with regard to a wide range of rapid and slow onset shocks, stresses, and disruptions [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], resilience has now become one of the most desired paradigms for communities in addressing uncertainties, like oppressive political regimes, military invasions, global economic downturn, globalization threats, environmental disasters, and climate change disturbances [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Some authors even argue that the concept of resilience has become a global institution since it has now “emerged as a key driver of reform in disaster management and now underpins how governments and key organizations understand risk, uncertainty, and disaster” [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Although resilience is explored in a wide array of scholarly disciplines, including mathematics, physics, engineering, ecology, geography, economics, psychology, public health, sociology, anthropology, development studies, political science, and disaster management [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-13-01211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], the study of how resilience emerges in a climate-challenged community is scant. Researchers still face difficulties in dealing with the resilience of a community: at the conceptual level, defining and identifying resilient actions; at the operational level, modeling resilient behavior of communities in a single framework; and at the empirical level, collecting and analyzing community resilience data [
