<p class="p">Simulated responses of trout from projections of forest harvest and climate change scenarios differed substantially from scenarios incorporating their combined effects (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Although we observed cases where the combined effects of forest harvest and climate change exceeded the additive influences of each, we commonly noted interactions where the effects from the combined scenario were less than the additive effects from separate scenarios. For example, over the entire study period in Pothole Creek, forest harvest increased biomass and the combined scenario decreased biomass, but less so than the climate change scenario alone. In general in ecological settings, although it may be expected that multiple stressors should interact synergistically, antagonistic responses are more frequently observed [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. In some cases we simulated here, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change. Specifically, the relative biomass of trout in Gus Creek increased under the combined scenario compared to climate change alone because increases in low-flow discharge associated with forest harvest offsets climate-driven declines in flows. Such findings are, however, highly context dependent and they depend on how future climate effects are realized. For example, trout responses to climate change could be more dramatic than we have modeled here if we had modeled longer simulations or when natural environmental conditions approach or exceed stressful thresholds for trout, especially during seasonal low flow. For example, if stream temperature continues to warm towards levels that are stressful to trout, increasing summer flows from forest harvest may no longer effectively offset warming temperatures.
