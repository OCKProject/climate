<p class="p">We generated the climate change scenario by increasing year-round stream temperatures and decreasing fall and winter flows. We increased stream temperatures by 0.06°C per year, a rate based on stream temperature trends occurring in the Pacific Northwest over the past 50 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], reaching 3.78°C higher than baseline at the end of the study period. This final increase in stream temperature is within the range of predicted warming for the Pacific Northwest [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. We decreased mean fall flows by 0.25% (October-December) and mean winter flows by 0.49% (January-March) each year [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], resulting in a gradual decrease over time that reached 15.75% below baseline for fall flows and 30.87% below baseline for winter flows at the end of the simulation. Streams of coastal Oregon generally have hydrographs dominated by rainfall, not snowmelt and, hence, key changes related to climate change are occurring during peak winter months due to decreasing rain and not during spring and summer snowmelt [
