<p class="p">Annual trends of both the median date of fry emergence and difference in magnitude of biomass of scenario compared to baseline for each stream were evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This rank-based test is robust to outliers and non-linear trends [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The Mann-Kendall trend values were corrected for serial correlation [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] using the package FUME for R [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. We evaluated annual trends of date of fry emergence and difference in magnitude of the scenario of interest and baseline over three timescales, including up to year 20, from year 20 to year 63, and over the 63-year duration of the study for all scenarios. By examining the trend up to year 20, we capture the time period when forest harvest may have the greatest impact and in a timeframe that a trend signal could be detected.
