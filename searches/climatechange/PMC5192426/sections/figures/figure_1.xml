  <p class="p">Diagram depicting the experimental design investigating the effects of environmental temperature on the kinematic velocity to reach maximum gape, hyoid depression, cranial rotation, and lower-jaw rotation. Four individuals of each invasive species 
   <italic class="italic">Belonesox belizanus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Pterois volitans</italic>, and 
   <italic class="italic">Cichlasoma urophthalmus</italic> were filmed while feeding on live-fish prey at 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C using high-speed video. The best four films of each individual feeding at each temperature were digitized to measure the four kinematic velocities stated above and to calculate Q10 values. Kinematic velocities and Q10 values were subjected to the appropriate statistical tests to determine the effects of temperature on prey-capture performance.
