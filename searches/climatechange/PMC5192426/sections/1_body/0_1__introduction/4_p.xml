<p class="p">Three invasive Florida fishes—Pike killifish, 
 <italic class="italic">Belonesox belizanus</italic> (Cyprinidontiformes); lionfish, 
 <italic class="italic">Pterois volitans</italic> (Scorpaeniformes); and Mayan cichlid, 
 <italic class="italic">Cichlasoma urophthalmus</italic> (Perciformes)—were used to determine how variable or consistent whole-organism response is, particularly in invasive species, to environmental temperature. Consistent with the prediction of climate-driven range expansion of invasive-species poleward, these invasive fishes have continued to extend their distribution northward from where they were introduced in south Florida [
