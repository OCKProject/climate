<p class="p">Interestingly, previous studies investigating temperature effects on whole-organism performance in fishes have revealed mixed results. The kinematics of routine-swimming in teleost fishes have been largely consistent with physiological expectations. For example, swimming velocity doubles in response to a 10 °C increase in environmental temperature, that is, Q10 values are at least 2.0 [

An attempt to arrive at a consensus on the effects of temperature on feeding kinematics in teleost fishes remains unsuccessful perhaps because of the differences in the experimental design employed by the relatively few studies investigating this subject matter. In investigating how decrease or increase in environmental temperature, between 18 °C and 24 °C, affect prey-capture performance, Wintzer and Motta [
 <xref rid="B19-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] concluded that it took bluegill (
 <italic class="italic">Lepomis macrochirus</italic>) longer to achieve maximum gape and lower-jaw rotation as water temperature decreased. DeVries and Wainwright [
 <xref rid="B20-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that a 15 °C decrease in temperature caused only the time to reach maximum gape, among all timing parameters that underlie suction feeding performance in largemouth bass (
 <italic class="italic">Micropterus salmoides</italic>), to slightly increase. In Sloan and Turingan [
 <xref rid="B35-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], and Turingan and Sloan [
 <xref rid="B36-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], Repeated Measures Multivariate Analysis of Covariance revealed that environmental temperature, raised from 20 °C to 30 °C at a rate of 1 °C daily, had no effect on the magnitude and timing of prey-capture kinematics of nonnative teleost fishes in Florida, USA. Considering that the ability to successfully capture prey determines individual survivorship, it is imperative to elucidate how environmental temperature mediates prey-capture performance in organisms.
