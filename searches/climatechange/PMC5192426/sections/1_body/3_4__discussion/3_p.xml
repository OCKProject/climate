 <xref rid="B36-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] underscore the thermal independence of prey-capture performance in invasive-teleost fishes. Suction-feeding, which is the most dominant and generalized mode of prey-capture in teleost fishes, relies primarily on the high-speed movement of cranial elements such as the jaws, hyoid, suspensorium, and cranium during mouth opening and closing (see

These kinematic events are accomplished primarily by the posterodorsal rotation of the cranium, depression of the hyoid apparatus, lateral extension of the suspensorial and opercular bones, and the posteroventral rotation of the lower-jaws [

However, temperature has no significant effects on the velocity of movement of the key elements of the prey-capture mechanism in the three contrasting models of invasive species reported here. Although, on average, prey-capture kinematics significantly differ among the three invasive species, the absence of a temperature-induced change in kinematic velocity is evident in all three invasive species [
