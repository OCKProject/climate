<p class="p">It is noteworthy that our results do not agree with the conclusions of the only two papers reporting the effects of temperature on the feeding kinematics of native teleost fishes. Prey-capture kinematics in North American native centrarchid fishes, bluegill

 <italic class="italic">Micropterus salmoides</italic>, responded to environmental-temperature change in a manner that is consistent with physiological predictions [

 <xref rid="B20-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Among other feeding-kinematic variables that were affected by temperature, it took longer for fishes to reach peak gape in colder than in warmer temperatures [
 <xref rid="B19-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The prevalence of thermally independent prey-capture kinematics in invasive teleost fishes underscores the need to address how they compensate for the effects of temperature on the contractile properties and contraction velocity of skeletal muscles. A direct comparison between any of the invasive fishes in this study and an ecologically relevant (e.g., as a competitor or prey) native species in Florida is imperative, given the need to address the direct impacts of invasive on native species.
