<p class="p">Empirical evidence of how organismal performance is affected by environmental change advances our understanding of the consequences of climate change and invasion of nonnative species. Investigations into the combined effects of both phenomena on native-community structure and dynamics, as well as range expansion of invasive species, are especially important considering that their combined effects are perhaps more devastating than each taken independently ([

It has been predicted that as a consequence of the pole-ward warming of the earth, tropical-invasive species will continue to expand their range toward higher-latitude ecosystems at alarming rates [

 <xref rid="B65-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Well known characteristics of invasive species that enable them to impart damage in the stability of native ecosystems include: (1) they have high propensity to introduce and spread diseases [

Although empirical evidence demonstrating the direct and indirect interactions between invasive and native species, as well as the cause-effect mechanism underlying post-invasion changes in community structure of invaded ecosystems, are elusive, it is hypothesized that climate change exacerbates the negative impacts of invasive species to ecology and society [

In our attempt to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the impacts of the invasive species and climate change coupling to ecosystem dynamics, our discussion of the results of this study centers on the question, “How do invasive fishes deal with variations in temperature within their invasive range?”
