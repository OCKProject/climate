<p class="p">As poikilotherms, the feeding performance of invasive fishes are expected to conform with the known effects of temperature on the physiology and ecology of heterothermic, aquatic animals [
 <xref rid="B79-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. For example, first, the velocity of fin propulsion during swimming and mouth-opening during feeding, behaviors fueled by skeletal-muscle contraction and relaxation, are expected to double when ambient temperature is increased by 10 °C. This is because at the physiological level of analysis, there is a two-fold increase in the rate of muscular contraction and relaxation for every 10 °C increase in temperature (i.e., Q10 = 2.0) [
