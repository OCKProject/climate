 <xref rid="B107-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>] demonstrated that short-term change in intracellular pH associated with decrease in water temperature from 25 °C to 5 °C was enough “to increase maximum force and, hence, power during isotonic shortening of muscle fiber, providing a short-term mechanism for compensation to low temperature”.
