<p class="p">Thermal independence of fast-start behaviors and kinematics has been found in other vertebrate animals. Navas et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] concluded that the Q10 for “jump take-off velocity and mean swimming velocity” in the frog 
 <italic class="italic">Rana temporaria</italic> was lower than Q10 = 2.0. “Running velocity during burst activity” in several species of lizards were less affected by temperature, as evident in the low Q10 values for this behavior [

 <xref rid="B91-biology-05-00046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Lack of temperature-induced variation in the dynamics of “ballistic mouth opening” was also evident in the frog
