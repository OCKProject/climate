<p class="p">Each fish was filmed until at least 10 feeding bouts were recorded in which the fish was perpendicular to the camera and exhibited maximum prey-capture performance. The best four films were analyzed per fish at each of the three experimental temperatures using MaxTRAQ (Version 2.2.4.1 Innovision Systems, Inc., Columbiaville, MI, USA). Each film was played back frame-by-frame to measure maximum gape (mm), hyoid depression (mm), lower-jaw rotation (degree), and cranial rotation (degree), as well as the time (ms) to reach each of these maximum kinematic-displacement variables. Time to reach each of these maximum kinematic-displacement variables was calculated using the frame prior to mouth opening as time = 0. Reference points (i.e., kinematic hotspots) used to measure these variables are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-05-00046-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Average velocity was calculated as the value of the maximum kinematic-displacement variable divided by the corresponding time to reach this maximum displacement: Gape Velocity = Maximum Gape ÷ Time to Reach Maximum Gape; Hyoid Velocity = Maximum Hyoid Depression ÷ Time to Reach Maximum Hyoid Depression; Lower-Jaw Rotation Velocity = Maximum Lower-Jaw Rotation ÷ Time to Reach Maximum Lower-Jaw Rotation; Cranial Rotation Velocity = Maximum Cranial Rotation ÷ Time to Reach Maximum Cranial Rotation. Physiological quotient (Q
