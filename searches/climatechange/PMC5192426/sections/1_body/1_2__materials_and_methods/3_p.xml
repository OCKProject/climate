<p class="p">Each of the four kinematic-velocity variables was subjected to a Model I least-squares regression against temperature to define the model y = a + bx; where y = kinematic velocity, a = intercept, b = slope, and x = environmental temperature (=20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C). To test the hypothesis that the Q10 of each of the kinematic-velocity variables was different from 2.0, a series of Paired t-Tests were conducted to compare the empirical Q10 values with the theoretical Q10 value of 2.0. All statistical tests were conducted using R.</p>
