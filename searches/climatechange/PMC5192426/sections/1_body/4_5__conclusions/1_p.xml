<p class="p">The velocity of jaw movements during prey capture in the invasive fishes, 
 <italic class="italic">Belonesox belizanus, Pterois volitans</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cichlasoma urophthalmus,</italic> were statistically unaffected by water temperature. Within the range of temperature used in this study, all invasive fishes successfully captured their prey using a stereotypical suction-feeding kinematic pattern that is unaltered by temperature. It is plausible that this seemingly temperature-resilient behavior will facilitate the successful expansion of the invasive range of these tropical-fish species as a consequence of global warming.
