<p class="p">Linear regression models indicated that the average velocity of kinematic events during feeding in all three invasive species remained consistent across environmental temperatures, with the exception of the average velocity of hyoid depression in the Mayan cichlid and average velocity of lower-jaw rotation in the lionfish. Species-specific variation in elevation (=y-intercept, a) is apparent, but, the slopes of the regression, b, were not statistically different from zero, indicating that kinematic velocities were unaffected by environmental temperature (
