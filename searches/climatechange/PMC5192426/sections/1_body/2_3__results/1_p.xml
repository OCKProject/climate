<p class="p">The three Florida invasive-fish species fed voraciously upon introduction of the prey during feeding-recording sessions at each of the three environmental temperatures, 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C (

The pike killifish stalked its prey and within a very short distance between the predator and the prey, the fish lunged toward the prey, opened its mouth widely and snapped at the prey. The lionfish used its pectoral fins to herd the prey closer to its mouth before suction feeding to capture prey. The Mayan cichlid behaved more aggressively; as soon as the prey was introduced into the filming tank, the cichlid rapidly swam toward the prey and suction-fed on it instantaneously.
