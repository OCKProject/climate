<p class="p">All traits varied between sites across the elevation gradient, but few had directional shifts along the elevation gradient (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). While there is substantial overlap in trait variation in many of the traits across the elevation gradient (overlap in the confidence intervals for all traits between sites, indicating few significant differences in mean trait values between elevations) there are some consistent shifts in the community biomass-weighted mean trait values with elevation.
