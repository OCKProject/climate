<p class="p">The variance partitioning analysis shows that nitrogen-related leaf traits (except for Î´
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N) tended to have very high intraspecific variation with &gt;75% of variation being found within species or sites (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). A set of other traits including specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, %P, and isotope rations had intermediate intraspecific variation, ranging from 25 to 40% of variation. Finally, %C and leaf area had less than 25% of their variation at the intraspecific level (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>).
