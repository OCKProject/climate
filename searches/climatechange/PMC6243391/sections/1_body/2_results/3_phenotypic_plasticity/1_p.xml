<p class="p">Phenotypic plasticity varied substantially by trait where δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N, leaf area, and %P were most plastic while C and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C were least plastic in response to transplantation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). For three traits, the amount of phenotypic plasticity varied by transplant treatment, where C:N (df = 704.6, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.41, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.016), leaf area (df = 708.4, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1.90, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.058), and leaf dry matter content (df = 708.4, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.56, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.011) all tended to change more when transplanted to cooler locations compared to warmer locations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Species and origin site random effects both had significant variance (species: χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 13.9, df = 1, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; origin: χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 10.3, df = 1, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) indicating that phenotypic plasticity varied by species and by origin site.
