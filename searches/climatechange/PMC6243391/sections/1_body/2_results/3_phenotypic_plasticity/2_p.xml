<p class="p">Slightly more transplants showed divergence in their trait value from the destination community mean after transplantation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 279) than transplants that showed convergence toward their destination community mean (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 277) while 180 transplants did not significantly change (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Additionally, slightly more transplants had functional trait values closer to their home community prior to transplantation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 400) compared to transplants where functional trait values were closer to their destination community prior to transplantation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 336). When combined, individuals were more likely to converge with their destination community trait mean if they started further away from their destination community mean (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic> = 36.54, df = 2, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Warming transplants were slightly more likely to result in convergence while cooling transplants were slightly more likely to result in divergence but this was not a significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">G</italic> = 2.49, df = 2, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.29). Between traits, the proportions of individuals converging and diverging varied substantially and this depended on both the type of transplant (warming or cooling) and where the individual trait value started relative to their destination trait community mean (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S2</xref>). Foliar %C showed consistently high rates of convergence under all conditions except when transplanted plants were warmed and they started closer to their home trait values. Those traits that showed greatest convergence did not tend to be those traits that varied more in community biomass-weighted mean values along the elevation gradient.
