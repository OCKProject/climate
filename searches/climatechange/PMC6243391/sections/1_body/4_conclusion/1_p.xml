<p class="p">A trait-based approach to community ecology is providing valuable insight into both the physiological mechanisms underpinning species’ broad-scale geographical distributions and patterns of local diversity (

The ability of a species to adjust its phenotype as the climate changes rapidly will be very important in plant persistence under new conditions. This is especially important in cold biomes, where climate is changing most rapidly.
