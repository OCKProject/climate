<p class="p">We assessed if the traits that are more variable will respond more quickly to environmental change. Our results show that a variety of alpine species had substantial phenotypic plasticity, although this plasticity was not necessarily related to intraspecific variation of these traits. Traits with high intraspecific variation did not correspond to traits that showed the highest plasticity in response to transplantation. We also assessed if patterns of intraspecific variation supported either community ecology models of intraspecific trait convergence or divergence. On the one hand, our results provide support of the community-weighted mean optimality hypothesis and support the assumption often made in community ecology that trends in intraspecific trait variation tend to mirror trends in interspecific variation (

This suggests that there is some advantage to adopting a similar phenotype to other species, but only if a plantsâ€™ phenotype started different to the members of its new community. On the other hand, our results also support trait divergence hypotheses (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valladares et al., 2007</xref>), but only if traits from the transplanted population are already close to the new community mean trait value. These seemingly contradictory results indicate that hypotheses of trait convergence and divergence may not be mutually exclusive and instead are dependent on the context of the underlying processes (
