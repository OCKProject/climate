<p class="p">To describe community trait distributions at our sites, biomass-weighted community trait distributions were calculated for each site using non-parametric bootstrapping (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Enquist et al., 2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). At each site we calculated 1000 replicate distributions. For each replicate, trait data for each species within the site was randomly sampled with replacement from the set of available trait data for that species. Trait data was not available for each species at each site, and so we prioritized trait data to use as follows: (1) focal species data from unmanipulated conditions at the focal site, (2) focal genus data from unmanipulated conditions at the focal site, (3) focal species data from any unmanipulated conditions, and (4) focal genera data from any unmanipulated conditions. When congener trait data were used as a proxy for focal species trait data, we randomly rarefied this data to ensure that each congener was equally likely to be sampled.
