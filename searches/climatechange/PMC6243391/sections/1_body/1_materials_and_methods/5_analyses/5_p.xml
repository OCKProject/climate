<p class="p">where H is the mean trait value of all individuals within the home control plot and T is the mean trait value of all individuals within the transplanted turf. The absolute value of the numerator is taken to standardize all potential trait shifts while the absolute value of the whole quotient is to standardize trait values that are negative (Î´

We used the lmer function with Satterthwaite estimations for degrees of freedom for hypothesis testing from the lmerTest R package (
