<p class="p">To quantify the extent of intraspecific vs. interspecific variation of leaf traits along the elevation gradient, we performed a variance partitioning analysis. This analysis assesses the variation in traits at different taxonomic levels (i.e., within-species, species, genus, family, and order) and between sites (populations) across the elevation gradient. We log transformed the data for the multiplicative growth traits (i.e., LA, LDMC, and LT) of all non-experimental leaves and performed a nested ANOVA using the lme (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Qu, 2017</xref>) functions in R (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Messier et al., 2010</xref>). For each level, the function first calculates the group mean. It then compares the variance around the group mean to the mean of the next level (e.g., variance of genus level is compared to the mean of family level). We used taxonomy as a substitute for phylogeny in the analysis. As a result, trait variance may be influenced by the loss of information about the ages of species, genera, families, and orders in relation to each other.
