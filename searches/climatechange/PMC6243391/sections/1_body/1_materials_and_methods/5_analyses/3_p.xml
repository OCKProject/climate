<p class="p">To examine phenotypic plasticity, we took the average trait value of each species in each plot to make comparisons between the trait values of plants in plots that had been transplanted with plants in plots that hadnâ€™t been moved. We only compared plots from the same block to reduce variation due to microtopographic and microclimatic variation at each site. First, we assessed if the experimental treatment influenced the relative plasticity of each trait,
