<p class="p">We used log-likelihood ratio tests (G-tests, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Signorell and Al et mult, 2018</xref>) to determine whether the proportion of comparisons converging or diverging (category 1 above) is dependent on transplant type (category 2 above) and whether the trait value started closer to the home or destination community values (category 3 above) for all traits together. We also determined whether transplantation induced a significant response in trait values by calculating the 99% confidence interval assuming a t-distribution around the mean value of each trait for each species under unmanipulated conditions at each site. If the mean value of a species trait value in a transplanted site fell outside of the 99% confidence interval from its home site, then it was considered a significant plastic response at the
