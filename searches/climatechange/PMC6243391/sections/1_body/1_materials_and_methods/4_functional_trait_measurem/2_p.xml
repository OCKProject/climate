<p class="p">All leaves for trait measurements were collected and stored in plastic bags and coolers in the field before transport to the lab. At the lab, leaves were measured for leaf area, leaf thickness, and fresh mass. Leaf area was measured on Canon LiDE 220 scanners at 300 dpi. Following scanning, ImageJ (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and LeafArea package were used to calculate leaf area (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Katabuchi, 2017</xref>). Leaf thickness was measured using calipers at three random locations on each leaf and the average taken for further analysis. Fresh mass was measured on a balance within 24 h of collecting leaves. Leaves were then dried for at least 72 h at 65°C before dry mass was measured. A subset of leaves was then ground into a fine powder and analyzed for nutrients and isotopes including P, N, C, δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N, and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C at The University of Arizona. Total phosphorus concentration was determined using persulfate oxidation followed by the acid molybdate method (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">APHA, 1992</xref>). Phosphorus concentration was then measured colorimetrically with a spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific Genesys20, United States). Carbon, nitrogen, and their stable isotope ratios were measured by the Department of Geosciences Environmental Isotope Laboratory at The University of Arizona on a continuous-flow gas-ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan Delta PlusXL) along with an elemental analyzer (Costech). Samples of 1.0 ± 0.2 mg were combusted and standardization was based on acetanilide for N and C concentration, NBS-22 and USGS-24 for δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, and IAEA-N-1 and IAEA-N-2 for δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N. Ratios between C:N and N:P were also calculated and analyzed. Prior to analysis, samples with apparent measurement errors that resulted in unrealistic trait values were removed. This included leaves with leaf dry matter values higher than 1 g/g, leaves with specific leaf area values less than 5 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g or greater than 500 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g and leaf nitrogen values higher than 6.4%. The nitrogen cutoff values was chosen based on the highest published leaf nitrogen values found in the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (
