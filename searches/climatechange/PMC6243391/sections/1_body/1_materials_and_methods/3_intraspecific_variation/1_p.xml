<p class="p">Ten of the most common species along the gradient were selected for sampling in experimental plots during August 2016. These include 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia flaccida, Epilobium fangii, Geranium pylzowianum, Hypericum wightianum, Pedicularis davidii, Persicaria vivipara, Plantago asiatica, Potentilla leuconota, Veronica szechuanica</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Viola biflora</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">rockiana</italic>. Of these species, only 
 <italic class="italic">P. leuconota</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. szechuanica</italic> were present across the whole elevation gradient, so all other species were found in transplanted turfs outside of the elevation range where they are common. These species were selected to avoid species that readily spread clonally to prevent measuring individuals that did not originally occur on the experimental turf. Because many species in this system display at least some clonal reproduction and distinguishing genetic individuals is impossible without destructive sampling, we worked at the ramet level in each plot, as in 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cui et al. (2018)</xref>. We only selected species that were present in turfs prior to transplantation and that had remained present in transplanted turfs. For these species, up to five healthy, fully expanded leaves were collected from individuals in each experimental plot (i.e., control, locally transplanted control, warmed, and cooled) where that species occurred. A total of 2,246 leaves were collected and measured with 112â€“350 individuals per species to assess intraspecific variation for these 10 species.
