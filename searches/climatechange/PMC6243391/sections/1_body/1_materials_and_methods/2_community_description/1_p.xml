<p class="p">We collected leaves from the most common species in the plant community at each of the four sites in August 2015 and 2016. Leaves (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2,873) were collected from 164 species outside of the experimental plots and we aimed to collect one healthy, fully expanded leaf from up to five individuals for each species at each site where they occurred. However, this was not possible for all species at all sites. To avoid sampling clones, we selected individuals that were visibly separated from other stems of that species. Most species were sampled in only 1 year and species sampled over both years were unlikely to be from the same individuals, as the area from which we sampled was large. Numbers of leaves per site varied from 533 to 850 (L = 809, M = 867, A = 664, H = 533). All these leaves were used to assess leaf structural trait variance partitioning (LA, LT, SLA, and LDMC) while a subset of 209 observations from all sites combined were used to assess leaf nutrient and isotope variance partitioning. Between 57 and 85% of the biomass in the 50 cm Ã— 50 cm plots used for community composition consisted of species with trait data, with between 97 and 100% of the biomass at each site comprised by genera with trait data (Supplementary Table
