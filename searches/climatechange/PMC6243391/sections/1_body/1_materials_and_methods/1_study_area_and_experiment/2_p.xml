<p class="p">A whole-community turf transplant experiment was established at these sites in 2012 when exclosures were erected to prevent grazing (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). Each transplanted turf measured 25 cm × 25 cm and were excavated to 20 cm depth or to where the soil ended, if that was shallower that 20 cm as was the case in the highest site. To control for the effect of transplantation, turfs were transplanted in the same site of origin. No differences were found between transplanted and untransplanted control plots, so both plot types were used as control plots in this study. Transplanted turfs were blocked such that each turf came from close to the control plots in the same block. In total, there were seven replicate turfs for each type of treatment and control at each site (except the highest site, where there are five replicates of each plot type, totaling of 92 plots used in this project). The local plant community composition and biomass was recorded in a separate set of 20, 50 cm × 50 cm plots (except for the highest site, where 13 plots were measured) at each site (for a total of 73 plots). These plots were used for characterizing the unmanipulated community composition at each site and are separate from the experimental transplant plots because biomass of each species was measured destructively in 2015. These community surveys were also used to characterize the regional species pool for partitioning of interspecific and intraspecific trait variation.
