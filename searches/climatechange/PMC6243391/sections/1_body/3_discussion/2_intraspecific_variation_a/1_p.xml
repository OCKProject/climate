<p class="p">There was little evidence that traits that have more intraspecific variation at the regional scale also have greater plasticity in response to climate manipulations. The structural leaf trait with most intraspecific variation (SLA) showed moderate plasticity while the trait with lowest intraspecific variation (leaf area) showed high plasticity (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Nitrogen-related traits with high intraspecific variation also tended to have moderate plasticity. Trait variation in the species pool involves long-term community assembly processes that are generating or constraining variation over long time-scales and is likely subject to different constraints compared to phenotypic plasticity (

Our measure of phenotypic plasticity, on the other hand, is a response to rapid change on the scale of years where only the individuals who can respond quickly can survive. Second, there are only certain traits that are likely to respond to the types of environmental change imposed on the transplanted plants in our study. For example, with decreasing mean temperature, there was an overall shift toward dominance by more conservative strategies (lower leaf area, higher thickness and leaf dry matter content, increased %C content, and lower %N). Further, colder sites are more dominated by plants with lower foliar N:P and Î´
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N. Specific leaf area, on the other hand, showed no directional change along the gradient, indicating that other factors than temperature are the most important determinants of optimal SLA values. These factors could include other abiotic conditions like differences in growing season length or biotic conditions like differences in soil microbe communities between sites (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tomiolo et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, our calculations of inter- versus intra-specific trait variation did not include measurements from transplanted individuals because only a subset of species were transplanted. If these transplanted individuals were included, we would expect much higher measures of intraspecific variation, as phenotypic plasticity can substantially weaken phylogenetic signal in functional traits (
