<p class="p">Phenotypic plasticity will likely be a very important way for organisms to tolerate changing future climate conditions (

The combination of a transplant experiment and an elevation gradient have allowed us to examine the extent and directionality of phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific trait variation under simulated climate change. This experiment reveals that all traits studied showed some level of plasticity in response to changing climate and a general trend of convergence toward the trait mean of their new community when that mean was far from their home trait value.
