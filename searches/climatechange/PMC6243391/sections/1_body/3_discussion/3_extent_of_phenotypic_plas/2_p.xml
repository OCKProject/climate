<p class="p">It is important to note that while we refer to trait shifts with transplantation as plastic, our comparisons rely on the assumption that transplanted plants started with similar phenotypes to the other plants at the site where they originated. This means that we cannot rule out the importance of maternal effects and epigenetic inheritance. Additionally, the observed phenotypic plasticity in this study may or may not be adaptive and the extent to which phenotypic plasticity is adaptive is difficult to quantify (
