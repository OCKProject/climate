<p class="p">If environmental controls on community assembly were strong along the gradient we would predict more consistent patterns of trait convergence toward community means. In our study site, like many other gradient studies (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muscarella and Uriarte, 2016</xref>), there is substantial overlap between mean trait values from site to site in most trait values (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). If there were substantial or directional trait differences between each site, those difference are likely to be driven mostly by species turnover. Under that scenario, transplantation would likely result in death, and only the most extreme plastic responses would promote survival. Since we are only working with species who have survived in their new conditions after transplantation for 5 years, all the intraspecific variation and plastic responses represent relatively successful strategies. We are not able to assess whether the individuals that did not survive had lower phenotypic plasticity or different tendencies than the winners reported here, but 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guittar et al. (2016)</xref> found that community trait values responded to transplantation by converging toward local trait values over time as species composition changed.
