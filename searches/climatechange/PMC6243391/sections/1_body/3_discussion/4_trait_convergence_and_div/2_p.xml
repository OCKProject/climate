<p class="p">Observations of convergence and divergence as plastic response to climate change could be due to other factors that we could not measure in this study. For example, phenotypic plasticity can be expressed as a result in interaction with new neighbors (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., in press</xref>). Our study also did not fully address the potential for fine-scale niche partitioning within communities. Such small-scale processes may be an important mechanism for the maintenance of local functional diversity (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stark et al., 2017</xref>). For example, microclimatic environmental conditions can vary within sites including soil depth, chemistry, water availability, light variation, and exposure to sun. Further, we did not assess multivariate shifts in traits between populations which may also better reveal the multivariate nature of community assembly (see 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kraft et al., 2015</xref>). As climate continues to change, the limits of this plasticity will be important to consider, but this study demonstrates the importance of considering both a speciesâ€™ traits and the plasticity in those traits when considering their ability to tolerate climate change.
