<p class="p">According to theory (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Enquist et al., 2015</xref>), phenotypic plasticity may be adaptive if it results in movement toward a trait optimum that is adaptive for a specific environment. We did find evidence that transplanting to a new community results in a plastic shift in trait values toward the new community dominant trait value. This was especially true when the transplanted species differed more from the members of its new community before transplantation. This central tendency is consistent with the results found by 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muscarella and Uriarte (2016)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lajoie and Vellend (2018)</xref>. However, when the difference between the transplanted species and the community mean trait value was small, phenotypic plasticity tended to result in divergence from the community mean. This could be a signature of biotic interactions where occupying space away from the mean trait value could be advantageous. On average, convergence was more common when transplants were moved to warmer conditions, especially when those plants started far from their destination community. This could be because competition is limiting the extent of higher elevation species at lower elevations and that this filter is stronger than the lower temperatures at higher elevations. Species moving to lower elevations can only survive if they can express the most competitive phenotype under these warming conditions.
