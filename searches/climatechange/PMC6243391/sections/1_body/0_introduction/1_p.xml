 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al., 2005</xref>). Ecological theory suggests that plant functional traits (characteristics related to life history strategies) should be related to the ability of a species to survive and reproduce in a given set of environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Funk et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the leaf economic spectrum is a set of leaf traits that characterize a continuum from fast to slow photosynthetic and tissue turnover rates (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">DÃ­az et al., 2016</xref>). Traits like those included in the leaf economics spectrum should be related to a species ability to persist under changing conditions. However, it has been difficult to test these predictions because variation in functional traits occurs at both inter- and intra-specific levels and can be affected by evolutionary history, environmental context, genetic constraints, and plasticity (
