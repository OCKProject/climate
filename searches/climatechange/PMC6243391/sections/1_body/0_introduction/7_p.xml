<p class="p">To answer these questions, we measured leaf functional traits in a reciprocal transplant experiment across an elevation gradient where a transplantation down the gradient simulates a warmer climate (+1.5°C) and transplantation up the gradient simulates a cooler climate (-1.5°C). This amount of warming is consistent with the smallest projected changes for the next 20–40 years in nearby Himalayan regions (

We conducted both warming and cooling treatments to examine the range of possible plant responses under contrasting environmental changes. As environmental conditions are changing rapidly in alpine environments, understanding the plasticity of leaf functional traits will help improve predictions of future plant community change.
