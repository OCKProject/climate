<p class="p">Phenotypic plasticity can play a role in the persistence of individuals under changing climate conditions (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nicotra et al., 2010</xref>) but the extent of phenotypic plasticity can be limited by ecological and evolutionary constraints (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valladares et al., 2007</xref>). If phenotypic plasticity promotes a tendency to converge on community mean traits (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>), it could help predict the likely effects of climate change on plant communities. These patterns can be examined by transplanting communities and comparing phenotypes under different environmental conditions (
