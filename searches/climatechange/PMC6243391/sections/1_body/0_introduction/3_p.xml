<p class="p">The distribution of traits within a community is expected to reflect variation around a mean optimal phenotype for fitness and/or growth rate (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Enquist et al., 2015</xref>). This idea follows from a central paradigm in ecology (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Whittaker, 1972</xref>) and evolutionary biology (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Levins, 1968</xref>) where observed shifts in phenotypes, speciesâ€™ abundances, and composition across environmental gradients reflect the arrangement of phenotypes or species that maximizes fitness in different environments. Abiotic filters such as temperature or moisture that limit successful survival strategies promote convergence of traits around this optimal local phenotype (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weiher and Keddy, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Violle et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, when competitive interactions are a dominant factor in species survival or environmental conditions are highly variable at a scale smaller than the study unit, there could be advantages to expressing more variable phenotypes that are not clumped at the optimal phenotype (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grime, 2006</xref>). However, tests of this theory have shown mixed results with some evidence for higher fitness (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lajoie and Vellend, 2018</xref>) or occurrence (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muscarella and Uriarte, 2016</xref>) when species are nearer the community trait mean while other cases showed no tendency for species in their preferred habitats to have trait values closer to the community mean (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). The importance of intraspecific variation in this dynamic is also unclear.
