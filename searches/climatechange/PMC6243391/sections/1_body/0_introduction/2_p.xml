<p class="p">Intraspecific variation arises from both heritable differences and plasticity (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Matesanz et al., 2012</xref>) and might be very important for adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bj√∂rklund et al., 2009</xref>). For example, those traits that exhibit low variation in variable environments may respond slowly and lag behind shifting optimal trait values. This suggests that the relative extent of variation in a trait that is due to intraspecific variation as opposed to interspecific variation might be informative in predicting how species will respond to climate change (
