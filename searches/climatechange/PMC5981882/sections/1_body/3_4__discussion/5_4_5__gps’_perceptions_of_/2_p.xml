<p class="p">Other statements of GPs underline the importance of drawing a precise and differentiated picture of heat health impacts. For instance, some GPs were convinced that heat would not increase mortality, if the harvesting effect was taken into account. The “harvesting effect” describes a forward displacement of mortality from an expected later point of time to premature time of deaths during a heat event [

 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. For instance, Bacchini et al. did investigate the harvesting effect in the European PHEWE study, but decided to not consider the effect in their final results. Still, they call for a more rigorous consideration of the harvesting effect in future studies and propose to find more sophisticated ways of quantifying heat health impacts, for instance in a years of life lost analysis [
