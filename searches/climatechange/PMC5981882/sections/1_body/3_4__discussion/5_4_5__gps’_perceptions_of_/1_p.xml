<p class="p">As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00843-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, many GPs [8/18] thought that mortality increase at the population level might be possible, but stated that they were not sure, because they did not experience this in their daily routine. As discussed in the introduction, many studies have shown that heat and heat waves increase mortality especially for the elderly [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. On the one hand this leads to the conclusion that GPs need to be better informed about heat-related mortality. Obviously, they were not acquainted with the current literature in heat health impacts. However, the perceptions of general practitioners also invite researchers to look at the topic of heat health from a practitioner’s perspective. In the most severe heat wave in recent years in 2003, about 900 to 1300 excess deaths occurred in Baden-Württemberg [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Currently, 7000 GPs practice in Baden-Württemberg [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Thus, less than every fifth GP had experienced one excess death due to heat in the 2003 heat wave. This example illustrates why some GPs did not associate heat and mortality and rather focused on the underlying morbidity, when thinking about heat health impacts.
