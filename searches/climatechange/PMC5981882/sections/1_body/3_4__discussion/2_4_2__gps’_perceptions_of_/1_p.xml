<p class="p">Corroborating our results, Ibrahim et al. found that on average GPs and other health staff thought that the mean maximum daytime temperature representing a hot day was 31 °C [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Yet many of GPs in this study thought heat waves to last over a week compared to common definitions, which usually do not exceed five days of duration [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. In the public health setting heat wave definitions start off with two days because research shows that lag times of heat health impacts are short, usually between 0–3 days [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Thus, in communication with GPs it is important to stress that heat waves can be deadly, even if they are short and even more so if humidity and night time temperatures are higher.
