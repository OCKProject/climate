<p class="p">In the heat wave summer of 2003, Baden-Württemberg experienced about 900–1300 and Europe for up to 70,000 excess deaths due to extreme temperatures [

 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Deaths attributable to heat waves are projected to rise significantly in Germany as in other European countries until the end of the 21st century due to climate change and aging populations [

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, in public health research heat wave definitions focus on their impacts on human health and often describe periods of at least 48 h, in which temperatures exceed a certain threshold (for instance 32° Celsius in Germany) [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. These definitions often consider apparent or perceived temperature, which also factors in variables such as humidity, which influence temperature regulation [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Zacharias et al. projected a tripling of the frequency of heat waves and a 25% increase in the duration of heat waves in Germany by the end of the century compared to the present climate leading to a rise in excess deaths from ischemic heart disease due to heat waves by a factor of 2.4 [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The elderly are defined as persons aged over 75 years in this study, because this age group has been found to be particularly vulnerable to heat in Baden-Württemberg [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. On the one hand, age subsumes many risk factors for suffering from heat such as pre-existing somatic and mental diseases, dependency on nursing care and intake of medication [
