<p class="p">The majority of GPs thought socioeconomic risk factors, such as the social support and nursing care situation to be crucial when judging the risk of the elderly to suffer from heat [19/24]. For instance, living alone without support was judged to be a risk factor [11/24]. Many GPs argued that quality of formal or informal care as well as the availability of a social network were decisive for the risk to experience heat health impacts. This was because such stakeholders could support elderly in adapting their behavior, e.g., by reminding them to drink sufficiently or by supporting them in activities of daily living in order to reduce physical activity and heat exposure:

  <p class="p">“If they are living alone, I think they are more at risk, because no one is looking after them. If the family lives with them […], one will look after them. In care homes, for example, they take care that there is sufficient drink and that they don’t go outside, especially in the greatest heat.”</p>
