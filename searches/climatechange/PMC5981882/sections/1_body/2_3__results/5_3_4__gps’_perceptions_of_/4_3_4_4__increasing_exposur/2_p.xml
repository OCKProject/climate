<p class="p">Still, when talking about climate change GPs often linked their statements with expressions of uncertainty [18/24]. Few GPs didn’t want to make concrete statements about meteorological changes caused by climate change at all because of uncertainty. GPs seemed to show less uncertainty, when talking about extreme weather events than when talking about rise in temperature. Furthermore, it was striking, that GPs usually referred to their immediate or long-term experience when evaluating climate change. If scientific information was mentioned, this was often done in a framing of mistrust.

I don’t really believe in these weather prognoses.”</p>
