<p class="p">Eight out of eighteen GPs thought that a mortality increase was possible at the population level, but stated, that they themselves had never experienced such an increase. Some thought that this was due to statistical reasons, because the number of total deaths was too small to be notice in a single practice.

  <p class="p">“I don’t know how many GPs there are in Baden-Württemberg? (…) There should be more than thousand, shouldn’t there? If we distribute 1100 more deaths on all the GPs then it would be about half a death more in the summer. You don’t notice that. You can only extricate it out of a statistic.”</p>
