<p class="p">Seven out of eighteen GPs associated heat waves with an increase in mortality. Most of these GPs were certain about this, whereas some expressed uncertainty. However, even those GPs did not attribute one of their own patients’ death clearly to a heat wave. Furthermore, none of the GPs drew on epidemiological evidence to support their argument:

  <p class="p">“Well, when there are really such heat waves, like e.g., in 2003, then I can imagine, I am even convinced that then a lot of elderly people, who don’t really have the opportunity to adapt through foods or fluids or something like that, that then mortality rises, especially in nursing homes. […] I don’t know if there’s literature about this.”</p>
