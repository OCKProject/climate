<p class="p">The study setting comprised four administrative districts in the Rhine-Neckar Region of Baden-Württemberg, Germany (namely 
 <italic class="italic">Stadt Heidelberg, Stadt Mannheim, Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhein-Neckar-Kreis</italic>). Those districts were chosen because they lay in or close to the upper Rhine Valley, one of the regions with greatest heat stress in Germany [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Thus, a wide variety of social realities was covered. As source population, we considered all 850 GPs of these districts registered with the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of the state of Baden-Württemberg early 2013 (

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. With a purposeful, maximum variation sampling technique, we sampled GPs with different characteristics in order to cover a great variation of perspectives [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-00843" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Those characteristics comprised GP’s sex, age and specialization (general medicine, internal medicine) as well as different practice settings (urban and rural—rural also comprised suburban settings) and practice structures (single practice, joint practice, ambulatory health care center).
