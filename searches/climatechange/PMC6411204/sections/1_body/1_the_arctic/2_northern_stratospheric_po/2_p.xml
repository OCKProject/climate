 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Enhanced wave breaking in the stratosphere caused a deceleration of the stratospheric westerly winds and hence, weakened the polar vortex. Although a general weakening of the polar vortex has been noted in many model experiments with perturbed Arctic sea ice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], the attribution of the observed change to sea ice loss is complicated by at least three factors. The first is divergence between different models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Second, there is an apparent sensitivity to the geographical location of ice loss. In model experiments, sea ice loss in the Atlantic sector appears to cause a weaker vortex, whereas a stronger vortex is found in response to sea ice loss in the Pacific sector [
