<p id="Par18" class="p">Arctic cyclone characteristics are correlated with key large-scale atmospheric indices, such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and NAM; however, these associations vary with season and none alone sufficiently explains cyclone variability or trends [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. The role that decreasing Arctic ice may be playing in these cyclone trends is a matter of considerable debate. Interaction between variability in Arctic sea ice and cyclones are complex, and apparent ice-cyclone associations appear dependent on data set resolution, and the identification method used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>•]. Open water areas in the Arctic have led to increased transfer of heat and moisture from the ocean to the atmosphere, warming and moistening the Arctic atmosphere and increasing the 
 <italic class="italic">potential</italic> for cyclogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]. However, the effect of atmospheric moisture increases on cyclone behaviour is unclear and appears sensitive to the spatial resolution of the reanalysis dataset and/or how well current models represent moist processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. What is becoming clearer is that investigations undertaken with higher resolution data sets reveal more cyclonic structures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. For example, Tilinina et al. (2014) conducted a cyclone investigation using the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis and identified a considerably higher number of cyclones over the Arctic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>•]. They found the set allowed for more accurate description of the life cycle of the most intense Arctic cyclones, compared to the global reanalyses. At higher resolution, cyclones had lower central pressures, faster deepening and stronger winds on average. Trends in such intense Arctic cyclones are attracting much interest, and there are suggestions that these features are becoming more frequent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. The so-called Great Arctic Cyclone of August 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>] broke the then-record of the lowest central pressure of all Arctic August storms since 1979 and this record still stands.
