 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. As noted earlier, there are signs that Antarctic ozone concentrations are beginning to rise; however, increasing emissions of short-lived anthropogenic chlorocarbons could slow this recovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>]. Thus, over coming decades, ozone recovery and GHG increases will likely have opposing effects on the SAM in austral summer. For the NAM, the effects of GHG and Arctic sea ice loss appear to oppose each other, particularly in boreal winter. Thus, in both hemispheres, what happens to the annular modes will reflect the balance of competing influences. Whilst the influence of GHG on the SAM and NAM is relatively consistent across seasons, the influence of Arctic sea ice loss on the NAM is greatest in boreal winter and the influence of ozone recovery on the SAM is greatest in austral summer. Thus, NAM and SAM projections are more uncertain in boreal winter and austral summer, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Outside of these seasons, the effect of GHG is dominant, leading to more robust projections of increasingly positive NAM and SAM.
