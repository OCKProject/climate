<p id="Par41" class="p">Past changes in Arctic cyclones vary considerably by season and by region and are sensitive to the data set, time period and methods used. Overall, there is some evidence for a change in the frequency or behaviour of Arctic storms. Furthermore, storms are occurring in a changing larger-scale environment. Moist intrusions associated with the passage of cyclones into the Arctic appear to be becoming more common, owing to increased humidity of the source air masses. Despite model uncertainty, future projections tend to support a reduction in the number of Arctic cyclones in boreal winter and more frequent storms in boreal summer, reflecting opposite trends in baroclinicity in these seasons. In the sub-Antarctic, an observed increase in cyclones south of 60Â°S is closely related to the positive SAM shift.</p>
