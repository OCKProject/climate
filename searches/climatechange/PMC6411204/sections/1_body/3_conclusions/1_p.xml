<p id="Par39" class="p">The most pronounced atmospheric circulation changes over the twentieth and twenty-first century to date have occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. The southern stratospheric polar vortex has strengthened and the SAM has shifted towards its positive phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), most strongly in austral summer, associated with a poleward migration of the westerly jet. These trends are largely attributable to human influence, specifically, emission of GHG and ozone-depleting substances. The surface expression of the effects of Antarctic ozone depletion and increased GHG has reinforced one another, mainly in austral summer, driving the SAM trend over recent decades. Stratospheric ozone depletion may also have played a role in the observed deepening of the ASL; however, separating human influence from that of natural variability is harder than for the SAM. In the Northern Hemisphere, changes in the stratospheric polar vortex and NAM are within the bounds of natural variability and cannot be attributed to human-induced climate change, despite speculation that these changes are caused by Arctic sea-ice loss.
