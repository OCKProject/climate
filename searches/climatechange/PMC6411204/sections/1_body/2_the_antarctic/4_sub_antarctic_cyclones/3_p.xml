<p id="Par35" class="p">The Antarctic region presents an environment somewhat different to that of the Arctic for cyclone properties simulated by models for the twenty-first century. Consistent with the Northern Hemisphere, Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi (2017) highlighted a summer poleward shift by 4.9° latitude of maximum zonally averaged cyclone track density and a notable increase in track density in the sub-Antarctic between 55 and 65°S [

Very marked in their results is a strong poleward expansion of the cyclogenesis region, with genesis increasing markedly in the 60–70°S band in response to the simulated shift in baroclinicity. With significant changes predicted in baroclinicity and total column water vapour [

Indeed, the CMIP5 models depict significant increases in extreme cyclones (defined in numerous ways) around most of the periphery of the Antarctic continent [
