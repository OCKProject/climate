<p class="p">Because of their known function in UV protection and potential value in plant systematics, a large number of studies have examined elevation changes in the levels of flavonoids (and related phenolic compounds) and/or UV screening in a variety of plant species (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cirak et al., 2017</xref>; and others). Some of these studies have further tested the linkage between elevation variation in flavonoids/UV screening and UV tolerance. In one of the most extensive studies to date, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sullivan et al. (1992)</xref> examined 33 species collected along a 3000 m elevation gradient in Maui, Hawaii, and found a significant, inverse relationship between elevation and negative effects of UV-B on growth for plants growing in a greenhouse. A companion study by 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziska et al. (1992)</xref> showed that greater sensitivity to UV-induced partial inhibition of photosynthesis in a subset of greenhouse-grown low elevation species (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) was associated with lower constitutive levels of UV-absorbing compounds relative to high elevation taxa. Thus, even though our study only examined UV screening, our findings imply that non-native species would not be more or less prone to UV-induced injury than native species under the extreme UV-B conditions in this tropical alpine environment. Furthermore, our findings that non-native species possess levels of UV screening that are comparable to those of native species do not support the general expectation that non-native species invest more heavily into resource acquisition and growth at the expense of stress tolerance mechanisms than native species (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Kleunen et al., 2010</xref>). Rather, it appears that the low resource, highly stressful environment of the alpine serves as a strong filter of plant species (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gerrish, 2013</xref>) and functional traits (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Funk et al., 2016</xref>) such that native and non-native species in this environment exhibit little difference in UV defense.
