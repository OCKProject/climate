<p class="p">Results from our survey of 19 species representing 13 different plant families indicate that significant interspecific variation exists in maximum (midday) levels of UV screening for plants growing in the Mauna Kea alpine/upper subalpine. Overall, however, epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> was low for all taxa (means ranged from 2.6 to 11.5%). Further, we found no significant differences in UV screening between native and non-native species. Most of the native species in our study were woody dicots (five of the eight species sampled) whereas the majority of the non-native species were herbaceous dicots (9 of 11 species sampled). Therefore, our comparison of native vs. non-native species was, to some degree, confounded with growth form effects. 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Day et al. (1992)</xref> reported significantly greater leaf epidermal UV transmittance in herbaceous dicots (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 7 species) than woody dicots (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3 species) for plants growing in a temperate subalpine meadow in Wyoming, United States (3310 m elevation). By comparison, we detected no significant effect of growth form on leaf optical properties in this tropical alpine environment. Our study was similar in size and scope to the study of 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Day et al. (1992)</xref> in that the majority (74%) of the species we tested were also herbaceous and most of these (71%) were forbs. Thus, even though differences in growth form composition existed between native and non-native species in our study, these differences appeared to have little effect on overall levels of UV screening between these two categories of species. It seems that growth form effects on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> are less pronounced in the extreme UV-B conditions in the tropical alpine than in lower UV-B environments, which occur at lower elevations and higher latitudes.
