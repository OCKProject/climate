<p class="p">In general, the success of non-native, invasive species is often attributed to their high levels of phenotypic plasticity, which then enables them to cope with a wide array of environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davidson et al., 2011</xref>). Many of the non-native species in our study, regardless of the timing of their introductions, may have achieved levels of UV protection that are similar to those of the native alpine species via phenotypic adjustment (i.e., acclimation) to the high UV-B irradiances in this alpine environment. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">V. thapsus</italic>, this is an herbaceous weed at many elevations in the temperate zone and this species has been found to exhibit a high degree of phenotypic plasticity rather than rapid evolution over the course of its invasions (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parker et al., 2003</xref>). Findings from the current study revealed that predawn T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> varied in a linear fashion (1.3% change in relative T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> per 100 m) with elevation in 
 <italic class="italic">V. thapsus</italic> whereas this was not the case for the native 
 <italic class="italic">V. reticulatum</italic> (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold>). Using a similar approach, but conducting measurements at midday over a narrower elevation range (ca. 800 m), 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruhland et al. (2013)</xref> reported linear decreases in T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> with increasing elevation (9.7% per 100 m) for the native shrub 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia tridentata</italic> in Wyoming, United States. Because of the short distances between their sampling sites, these authors attributed the elevation variation in UV screening in 
 <italic class="italic">A. tridentata</italic> to phenotypic plasticity rather than ecotypic differentiation. In a growth chamber study, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beckmann et al. (2012)</xref> found similar levels of phenotypic plasticity in native (German) and non-native (New Zealand) populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Hieracium pilosella</italic> in morphological and growth responses to UV-B, though some genetic differentiation also occurred between these two populations. Thus, at present it is not clear whether non-native species (or populations) exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity in UV protection than native plants and further study on a greater number and diversity of species is needed to adequately test this hypothesis. It is conceivable, however, that phenotypic plasticity in UV protection in 
 <italic class="italic">V. thapsus</italic> is one factor that has aided the invasion of this particular species in Hawaii.
