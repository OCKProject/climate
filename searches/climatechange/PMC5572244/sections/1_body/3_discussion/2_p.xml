 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eldredge and Evenhuis (2003)</xref> reported that of the 2311 species of vascular plants known to occur in the Hawaiian Islands ca. 50% (1160) of these species are non-native (non-indigenous) in origin. Only a small fraction (73 species or ca. 3%) of these species occurs in the alpine/upper-subalpine of Mauna Kea though the relative floristic composition of non-native species in this life zone (54%) is comparable to that of the Hawaiian Islands in general (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gerrish, 2013</xref>). In our study, we examined about one-third of the native and non-native species of the Mauna Kea alpine/upper subalpine (8 native and 11 non-native species). Our results are therefore derived from sizable and comparable fractions of the native and non-native flora present in this habitat and there is no reason to believe that our findings would have differed had we sampled a greater number of species in the Mauna Kea alpine.
