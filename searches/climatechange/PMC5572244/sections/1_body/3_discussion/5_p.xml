<p class="p">In this study, we focused on the attenuation of incoming UV by the epidermis (i.e., UV screening) as this mechanism provides the first line of defense against the potentially deleterious effects of UV-B. However, UV protection in plants involves not only UV screening but other factors as well, such as levels of antioxidant compounds, DNA repair and leaf thickness, that all serve to protect and repair sensitive targets from direct and indirect UV-induced injury (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robson et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, these other mechanisms of UV protection have been shown to vary with elevation. For example, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang Q. W. et al. (2016)</xref> found that differential sensitivity to UV radiation between high vs. low elevation populations and species of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> growing in the Hakkado Mountains, Japan, was attributable, in part, to population differences in DNA damage and repair. 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wildi and LÃ¼tz (1996)</xref> reported that total antioxidant levels increased with elevation in several species in the Austrian Alps, but whether these differences were due to elevation changes in UV, temperature, or other factors was not assessed. Moreover, while the attenuation of UV within the leaf is predominantly influenced by UV-absorbing compounds, the surface features of leaves (e.g., trichomes and waxes) can also influence leaf optical properties (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holmes and Keiller, 2002</xref>) and in some cases these traits have been shown to vary with elevation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pilon et al., 1999</xref>). One of the species in our study (
 <italic class="italic">V. thapsus</italic>) possesses pubescent leaves and it is conceivable that the trichomes of this species are also involved in UV screening. We did not test whether these hairs absorb or reflect UV nor did we evaluate whether there were elevation changes in the levels of pubescence in this species. Increases in pubescence would add to the UV-filtering effect of the epidermis and thus further decrease T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> but only if the leaf hairs possessed UV-absorbing compounds. Pubescence would likely have no effect on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>, as measured with the UVA-PAM, if the hairs primarily reflect UV, as they would also reflect visible (including blue light) radiation (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holmes and Keiller, 2002</xref>). In this situation, the ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">BL</sub> and thus T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> would be unaffected by variation in trichome density.
