 <sub class="sub">1,17</sub> = 0.05;

 <sub class="sub">2,15</sub> = 0.82; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.46) of growth form on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>, when averaged at the level of species (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>
 </bold>). However, data were variable and forbs represented a disproportionate fraction of the species tested (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10) as compared to grasses (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3) and woody plants (trees and shrubs; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5). The single fern species was excluded from the growth form analysis. We found no consistent patterns in T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> in growth forms between native and non-native species but replication was insufficient to test for statistical differences (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>
 </bold>). Even though measurements were taken over a range of elevations (2774â€“3962 masl), we found no significant relationship between T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> and elevation for the species sampled (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.20; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.42; not shown). The average sampling elevation of native species (3326 masl) was also not significantly different (ANOVA; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,17</sub> = 0.02; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.89) than that for the non-native species (3291 masl).
