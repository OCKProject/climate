<p class="p">Measurements of T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> by the UVA-PAM generally exhibit strong, positive correlations with direct measurements of epidermal UV transmittance (in both the UV-B and UV-A) made from epidermal peels (

 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> made by the UVA-PAM are generally correlated with epidermal UV-B transmittances (T
 <sub class="sub">UV B</sub>), the specific relationships between T
 <sub class="sub">UV B</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> can vary with species, depending on the type of UV-absorbing compounds employed (e.g., flavonoids vs. HCAs; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bilger et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, while epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> measurements made with the UVA-PAM can serve as reasonable estimates of the overall UV screening of leaves (including T
 <sub class="sub">UV B</sub>, which is technically much more difficult to measure in the field than T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>), we are unable to precisely relate levels of UV-A screening to that for UV-B in the species surveyed in this study. Also, the presence of anthocyanins in the epidermis can introduce errors in determining T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> with the UVA-PAM by affecting the penetration of the reference (
