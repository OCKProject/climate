<p class="p">Non-invasive measurements of epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> were made on adaxial (upper) surfaces of healthy, fully expanded leaves with a field-portable pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometer (UVA-PAM; Gademann Instruments, Würzburg, Germany). This instrument provides estimates of epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> by measuring the fluorescence yield of chlorophyll (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>; λ &gt; 650 nm) induced by UV-A (375 nm) and blue (BL; 470 nm) radiation, as outlined by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kolb et al. (2005)</xref> and following the precautions and procedures of 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnes et al. (2008)</xref>. This technique is based on the premise that both UV-A and BL can induce chlorophyll fluorescence and that reductions in the penetration of UV to the mesophyll (e.g., from UV-absorbing compounds in the epidermis) will reduce UV-A-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>). Fluorescence induced by BL (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">BL</sub>), which is not absorbed by UV pigments, serves as a reference to account for variation in chlorophyll content and distribution in the mesophyll. Ideally, calculations of epidermal UV transmittance using this technique are based on the 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">BL</sub> of epidermis-free leaf samples. As it is usually not possible to readily remove the epidermis for most species, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">BL</sub> values are normally expressed relative to a blue plastic standard (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany), which has emission properties similar to an epidermis-free green leaf. Such was the case in this study. The epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> reported here should therefore be considered as approximations of the true transmittances for these species.
