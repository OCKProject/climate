<p class="p">Previously, we reported that several of our study species (
 <italic class="italic">V. thapsus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Oenothera stricta</italic>) exhibited diurnal changes in epidermal T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> at this study location, with absolute values of T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> decreasing 1–3% from predawn to midday and then increasing to predawn levels at sunset (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>). Although diurnal changes in T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> are now known to occur in many species (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnes et al., 2016a</xref>), it is unknown if all the species studied here undergo these diurnal changes. To allow for comparisons among species in the alpine survey we therefore measured T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> of all species under clear skies during midday (10:00 to 14:00 h local time). These values thus represent maximum levels of UV screening (minimum T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>) for all species regardless of whether or not they adjust T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> throughout the day. For the elevation study, we did not want diurnal changes in T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>, which could potentially vary in magnitude with temperature and sky conditions (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnes et al., 2016a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>), to confound elevation/UV-B effects on UV screening. For this study, we therefore measured T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub> ca. 1 h prior to sunrise (predawn). These values thus represent the “baseline” level of UV screening within each species.
