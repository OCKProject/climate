<p class="p">The primary goal of this study was to compare UV screening in native and non-native species growing in this tropical alpine environment. We recognized, however, that there was a diversity of plant growth forms in the Mauna Kea alpine, and results from previous studies (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Day et al., 1992</xref>) have shown that UV screening can vary significantly among plant growth forms. Thus, we also wished to compare UV screening among plant growth forms to determine if any potential differences in UV screening between native and non-native species could be attributable to growth form differences. We attempted to survey species representing all of the major growth forms present on Mauna Kea [i.e., woody dicots (trees and shrubs), herbaceous dicots (forbs), and grasses]. We did not examine any conifers (none occurred at our study site) and we also did not sample any cushion plants, rosettes or succulent growth forms that are often found in alpine life zones (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gerrish, 2013</xref>). As a consequence of the sampling limitations described above, the native species tested were mostly woody species (i.e., five of the eight species were shrubs or trees) whereas all of the non-native species were herbs (forbs or grasses;

Also, the native species sampled were all perennials, whereas the non-natives included both annuals and perennials. One species of native fern was sampled. Nomenclature follows
