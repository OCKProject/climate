<p class="p">Studies were conducted on 19 common native (8) and non-native (11) wild species growing on native volcanic soil in un-shaded habitats on the south slope of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, United States (19°45′N, 155°27′W) ca. 2800–3900 masl from early to mid-June (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>). We were limited in the amount of the Mauna Kea alpine/upper subalpine vegetation we could sample in due to logistical constraints (i.e., there are very few roads on the mountain) and out of deference to the indigenous Hawaiian culture that considers the mountain to be sacred. The majority of our sampling was therefore conducted within the south-facing slope of the 212 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> Mauna Kea Forest Reserve, including sites along the Mauna Kea access road leading from the Mauna Kea Information Visitor’s Center (2800 masl) to the summit (ca. 4200 masl). Within this area, we selected species for study that were easily accessible (they occurred within ca. 1 km of the Mauna Kea Access Road), relatively abundant (at least 10 individuals present per sampling location), and which were suitable for measurement (large enough leaves to fit the sampling chamber and green in color; see below).
