<p class="p">Measurements of UV screening [epidermal UV-A transmittance (T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>); see below] were taken on 10 plants/species selected haphazardly at each sampling location with two to three leaves measured per plant. There was no systematic pattern of leaf sampling within each plant (i.e., we made no attempt to isolate the effect of leaf position or age on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>). Rather, we haphazardly selected several leaves among the healthy, mature leaves on an individual plant shoot. Preliminary analyses (ANOVA) showed no significant effect of leaf sample number on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>. Thus, data were averaged within a plant and subjected to an arcsine transformation (

We used individual one-way ANOVAs (SAS JMP, Cary, NC, United States) to test for species, growth form, and native vs. non-native effects. In the ANOVA testing for the effect of species on T
 <sub class="sub">UV A</sub>, the individual plant was the unit of replication. For the other ANOVAs (growth form and native vs. non-native comparisons) we averaged values within a species such that the individual species was the unit of replication. Significant differences were determined at
