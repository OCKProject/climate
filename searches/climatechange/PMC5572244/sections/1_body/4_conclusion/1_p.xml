<p class="p">Our findings indicate that high levels of UV screening are not restricted to plant species native to the high UV-B conditions of the tropical alpine and that plasticity in epidermal UV transmittance is a mechanism employed by some, but not all, species to cope with varying solar UV exposures. Whether this plasticity in UV screening is a general feature of non-native species is unknown, but our findings do suggest that many terrestrial plants will be able to tolerate the increased levels of UV-B radiation as they migrate to higher elevations as a consequence of climate change.</p>
