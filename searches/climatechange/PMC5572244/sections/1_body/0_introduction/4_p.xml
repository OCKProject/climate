 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Day et al. (1992)</xref> found that the leaf epidermis of herbaceous dicots (forbs) was less effective in attenuating UV-B than that of grasses and woody dicots. The accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds and resultant changes in leaf optical properties are also highly plastic traits in many species (
