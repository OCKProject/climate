<p class="p">At present, very little is known whether native and non-native plant species differ in their tolerances to UV-B and levels of UV protection. The apparent greater propensity for non-native species to migrate to higher elevations than native species may indicate that non-native species are capable of adjusting their UV protection more effectively, either through greater phenotypic plasticity or more rapid genetic adaptation, than native species. Indeed, the success of non-native species in general is often attributed, in part, to their high degree of phenotypic plasticity to environmental change (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richards et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davidson et al., 2011</xref>). If non-native species exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity to UV-B change than native species, one would expect greater variation in UV protective mechanisms along elevational/UV-B gradients relative to native species, and non-native species would display similar or perhaps even higher levels of UV protection than native species in the high UV-B alpine environment. Alternatively, many non-native species possess functional traits (physiology, allocation, growth rate, etc.) that allow for high rates of resource acquisition and performance (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Kleunen et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Funk, 2013</xref>) and these traits can come at a cost in reduced tolerance to abiotic stress in harsh conditions, such as occurs in the alpine (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brock and Galen, 2005</xref>). Tolerance to UV-B is often cross-linked with tolerance to other abiotic stresses such as drought (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bandurska et al., 2013</xref>) and defense against pests and pathogens (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mewis et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zavala et al., 2015</xref>). It is thus conceivable that non-native species may invest less in UV protection than native species and may be more rather than less sensitive to UV-B than native species. If this is the case, the invasion of high elevation habitats by non-native species may be governed less by UV-B tolerance than by other plant attributes, such as life history traits and competitive abilities. In support of this hypothesis, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang H. et al. (2016)</xref> reported that non-native populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Triadica sebifera</italic> exhibited greater sensitivity to elevated UV-B than native populations under controlled conditions. Whether these differences in UV tolerance were the result of differences in UV-absorbing compounds and UV screening was not investigated. Taken together it is therefore difficult to predict, 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic>, whether non-native species that occur in high elevation environments would exhibit similar, higher or lower levels of UV protection than their native counterparts.
