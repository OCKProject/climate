<p class="p">In the study described here, we characterize the leaf optical properties of a suite of native and non-native plant species of different growth forms growing in the tropical alpine and upper subalpine of Mauna Kea, Hawaii to test whether differences in epidermal UV transmittance (measured as the screening of UV-A radiation) exist between native vs. non-native species. Additionally, we examine UV screening of a native and a non-native species along an elevation gradient spanning 2600â€“3800 m to determine if these species differ in their abilities to adjust their levels of UV protection in response to natural variation in UV-B exposure. This study examines the ability of native and non-native plant species to cope with extreme natural levels of UV-B, and thus provides insights into the role that UV-B may play in influencing climate change-induced upward range expansions in mountains.</p>
