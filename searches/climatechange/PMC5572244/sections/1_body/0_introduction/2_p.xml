<p class="p">Because of differences in atmospheric conditions (primarily optical depth of the atmosphere and the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer) and prevailing solar angles, the levels of solar UV-B radiation (280–315 nm) generally increase with decreasing latitude and increasing altitude (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McKenzie et al., 2001</xref>). Consequentially, tropical alpine environments experience some of the highest UV-B irradiances on the Earth’s surface. UV-B radiation is known to induce a number of potentially deleterious effects in plants, including disruption of the integrity and function of important macromolecules (DNA, proteins, and lipids), oxidative damage, partial inhibition of photosynthesis and growth reduction (
