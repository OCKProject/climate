However, there is a need to understand stakeholders&#x02019; perspectives on the identification, development, and utility of such indicators. A qualitative approach was used, comprising semi-structured interviews with key informants and service providers from government and non-government stakeholder organizations in South Australia. Stakeholders saw a need for indicators that could enable the monitoring of health impacts and time trends, vulnerability to climate change, and those which could also be used as communication tools. Four key criteria for utility were identified, namely robust and credible indicators, specificity, data availability, and being able to be spatially represented. The variability of risk factors in different regions, lack of resources, and data and methodological issues were identified as the main barriers to indicator development. This study demonstrates a high level of stakeholder awareness of the health impacts of climate change, and the need for indicators that can inform policy makers regarding interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>indicators</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>health outcome</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd><kwd>stakeholder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijerph-14-00552"><title>1.

Australia&#x02019;s climate has warmed by around 1 &#x000b0;C since 1910, and over the past 15 years, the frequency of very warm months has increased five-fold, with more hot days and fewer cool days predicted [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. </p><p>One of the 17 goals of The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Climate change impacts directly and indirectly on human health, as shown in several Australian studies [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Substantial heat-related morbidity and mortality have been reported in association with extreme heatwaves [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and air pollution events due to bushfires and dust storms have been associated with mortality and increased hospitalizations [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These events are predicted to increase with climate change [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A changing climate can also affect the transmission of climate-sensitive mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Ross River virus disease [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], in addition to food-borne diseases such as salmonellosis [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>Health-related climate change indicators are quantitative measures to monitor the effects of climate change on population health [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and should be based on a sound link between the exposure to environmental hazards and human health effects [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Studies have noted aims to track health effects of climate change using several indicators such as excess morbidity and mortality due to extreme heat; number of injury, death, and mental health outcomes due to extreme weather events including floods and droughts; cases of environmental infectious diseases; and health outcomes related to air pollution and aeroallergens [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These indicators can also be used to assess the effectiveness of public health adaptation strategies and plans. For example, health-related indicators developed in 51 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe have had important implications in evaluating heat preparedness planning in the region [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>At present, in Australia, indicators of environmental change are distinct and separate from indicators of health. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) and The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) are currently using climate data such as temperature and rainfall to monitor the state of the climate and to predict how climate is likely to change in the future [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is one of the national organizations which reports on cause-specific health indicators such as asthma and selected infectious diseases [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While associations between human health and environmental data have been explored in some cases such as the health impacts of extreme heat waves in 2008, 2009, and 2014 in Australia [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a set of regular health-related climate change indicators has yet to be implemented. These indicators would be useful to policymakers and public health authorities to measure and monitor the health effects of climate change over time, identify vulnerable populations, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p><p>Prior to developing indicators, it is important to define from the start the purpose of the indicators, who will use them, and how they will be used. Therefore, stakeholder involvement at an early stage of indicator development is essential to establish views on the usefulness of and requirements for indicators [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The involvement of a broad range of stakeholders from sectors other than health is also necessary, because climate change issues are intersectoral, affecting a multitude of different areas and government departments [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to explore stakeholders&#x02019; needs and requirements for measuring and tracking the adverse health effects of climate change and the factors perceived to increase people&#x02019;s vulnerability to the changing climate. This study, conducted in Adelaide, the capital of the state of South Australia, examines the criteria required to produce robust indicators from the perspective of stakeholders, and the issues they face in developing and using indicators. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-14-00552"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The development of environmental health indicators is complex and requires a deep and nuanced understanding of the needs of stakeholders. A qualitative approach was used in this study to explore the perceptions of the relevant stakeholders, ascertain details about data and information that is essential for stakeholders, and understand the barriers that need to be overcome in developing useful indicators.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-ijerph-14-00552"><title>2.1. Theoretical Perspective</title><p>Analysis was undertaken from a critical realist position, as described by Willig [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This approach has been extensively used in studies that examine climate-related issues, including mitigation policy and energy technology debates, and relationships between social activities and climate outcomes [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Critical realism is a theoretical approach to data analysis concerned with characterizing the nature of reality, whilst acknowledging that a person&#x02019;s &#x0201c;reality&#x0201d; is bounded by multiple meanings made available to them in the social context [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this way, participants&#x02019; views are considered contingent upon locally available knowledge and, thus, analysis does not assume that data constitutes a direct reflection of reality. Rather, it presupposes that interpretation of data is required in order to develop a contextualized understanding of the underlying structures of the phenomenon under examination [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the present study, critical realism aids in understanding stakeholders&#x02019; views on the usefulness and development of indicators to measure the health impacts of climate change, backgrounded against the current social context. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijerph-14-00552"><title>2.2.

This involved a stepwise process starting with the transcription of the recorded interviews, reading and rereading the text, and noting down initial ideas. Passages of text that displayed similar ideas or concepts were coded and later refined in an iterative process, and finally assigned to particular codes.

Results</title><p>Of the 21 participants, 14 were from state or local governments, two were consultants, two were academics, and one was from emergency services (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00552-t002">Table 2</xref>). The expertise and knowledge of the participants were diverse, as organizations and individuals differed in terms of the data they generate or use, services they provide, and their need for indicators. Analysis of the interview data generated five main themes with sub-themes. Themes related to the purpose of using indicators, types of data, criteria for selection of indicators, issues, and alternative indicators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00552-t003">Table 3</xref>). </p><p>Participants noted a range of climate change-induced extreme weather events and environmental changes including heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughts, and sea level rise that were potentially linked to adverse effects on human health. They described adverse health effects such as increases in food-borne diseases on hot days, the risk of mosquito-borne diseases that increases with rainfall, and the expansion of standing waters in coastal areas due to sea level rise. </p><p>Participants thought that changes in climate had resulted in hotter weather, were concerned about extreme heat posing a serious risk to the health of vulnerable people, and were aware that the health effects of climate change are not, and will not be, equally distributed. They mentioned factors contributing to vulnerability including: age, needing assistance, ill health, poor English language proficiency, being alone, lack of transport, low level of education, lack of employment, low level household income, financial stress, ethnicity, no access to internet connections, and lack of social connectedness. They also recognized the importance of vulnerability considerations in planning and delivering interventions, and emphasized the need to build community resilience. </p><p>Participants were keen for health-related indicators of climate change to be available and spoke of how they would use indicators, the types of data that would be useful as indicators and the data that are currently available, what makes a good indicator, and issues and barriers to the development of indicators. These issues emerged as the main themes identified from the narratives, as outlined below.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijerph-14-00552"><title>3.1. Purpose of Using Indicators</title><p>Participants explained the different purposes for which indicators could be used, based on their needs and interests. These included: (i) monitoring and tracking changes in the climate, and the impacts that long and short-term changes might have on human health and the environment; (ii) monitoring disease trends; (iii) measuring adaptation; (iv) evaluating actions taken; and (v) as tools for communication. </p><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-ijerph-14-00552"><title>3.1.1. Tracking Changes in the Environment and Monitoring Impacts on People</title><p>Participants explained that they use indicators to track environmental changes and monitor impacts that the changes might have on the health of people and the environment. They said they use data that monitors trends over time for temperature, rainfall, soil conditions, droughts, and sea level rise, and these could also be used as ways to mitigate the associated health impacts.

Data for Indicators Development</title><p>Interviewees mentioned that the types of data collected by organizations include: (i) environmental monitoring data such as air and water quality data; (ii) disease surveillance data; (iii) weather modelling and prediction data; and (iv) survey data. Some organizations did not generate their own data and were dependent on data generated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), or other government organizations. Respondents discussed data that were available to them that could be used as health and environmental indicators, and the way that it can be accessed. </p><p>The Environment Protection Authority South Australia, for example, publishes monthly and quarterly air pollution quality summaries and reports online, and daily air quality data over long periods of time that can be made available by request [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Sixty automatic stations are available in South Australia for collecting weather data, which are available online. In terms of survey data, some local governments undertake local surveys by phone in order to gain subjective self-reported data on different levels of vulnerability and the resilience of communities in terms of an adverse event.

Spatial Representation of Indicators</title><p>Interviewees explained there was a demand for the spatial analysis of data that can be used to produce maps to visually represent several different indicators at once. They thought that data presentation in the form of maps would clearly reveal the areas of change, spatially and temporally, whilst saving many words, graphs, and tables in reports. For example, they can be used by stakeholders to show where flooding is likely to occur, areas of vulnerability, or where certain health outcomes are greatest.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;One map tells an amazing story compared to what you could, I think that those maps are incredibly powerful for talking with local government councils&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(State government officer 1)</attrib></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;People find it easy to look at a map and say ok so where do the old people live, where is it going to be flooded &#x02026;lots of types of vulnerabilities to different risk factors&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(Non-government consultant 1)</attrib></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec3dot3dot5-ijerph-14-00552"><title>3.3.5. Specificity of Indicators</title><p>Participants&#x02019; responses showed that developing a list of indicators might be helpful to stakeholders, but to be practical to use, they need to be specific and fit for purpose. For example, disease data may be required in specific formats such as disease notifications or cases hospitalized. Another example is age as a vulnerability indicator. An older age is a risk factor for heat-related illness, but specific age categories need to be defined as required to be a suitable indicator, as outlined in this quote: </p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;what we did first of all, we looked at the, I guess the traditional definitions of vulnerability &#x02026; we had initially age over 60 and someone said no, people over 60, it&#x02019;s not over 60 now, it should be over 75 &#x02026; because people are more healthy and stronger as they are getting older now&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(Non-government consultant 1)</attrib></disp-quote></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-ijerph-14-00552"><title>3.4.

Climate Change Is a New and Complex Area</title><p>Respondents spoke of the difficulty in understanding the relationship between climate change and human health and wellbeing, especially for vulnerable populations.

While heatwaves occur across the state, there are specific areas prone to sea-level rise, floods, and bushfires. This may cause difficulties in the development and application of indicators.

Data and Methodological Issues</title><p>Data and methodological issues arise in terms of data collection for health-related and environmental indicators of climate change. Issues mentioned include: lack of robust data; data inconsistency and non-comparability due to changes in methods and technology; gaps in data; and not having a central repository of data.</p><p>A lack of robust diagnostics and data for some climate-sensitive diseases is a limitation to the development of health-related indicators of climate change. Disease surveillance experts spoke of logistical issues such as laboratory testing for Arboviruses (viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes) and the problem of false positives or new testing methods creating inconsistencies in the data. </p><p>Changes in technology over time also cause problems with long-term environmental indicators. An environmental scientist said that current air pollution monitoring instruments are different from the instruments used 30 years ago, which would make comparisons of current data with previous data problematic. Another example is inconsistencies over time in the methods used for flood mapping. Moreover, gaps in the data for some locations impedes the use of current data as indicators and attempts to retrofit data can substantially decrease data accuracy. </p><p>A respondent also alluded to the significance, and yet lack of, subjective data that are needed to measure the community resilience to climate change impacts. They said that it is difficult to gather data on how people perceive changes and develop resilience to extreme weather events and emergencies. An understanding of how individuals and communities prepare for and respond to emergency situations would be useful, as would their perceptions of when weather extremes would exceed coping abilities. It was said that this type of perception data would be useful to stakeholders involved in emergency management planning and service provision. </p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I think a lot of data that we perhaps do not have access to and we simply do not get it, &#x02026; is that community perception data, so what &#x02026; does the community need?

Alternative Indicators</title><p>Respondents provided recommendations on using alternative data that can be helpful in terms of monitoring and tracking changes. Some suggested using environmental indicators as a proxy for health indicators. For example, the surveillance of mosquito populations could be an indication of mosquito-borne pathogens. However, it should be noted that there are many other factors such as the immune status of host populations and socioeconomic conditions that influence disease transmission [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Using general practitioner (GP) data as health indicators for morbidity was mentioned by one participant.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;One type of data that I think is not easy to collect and readily available that could be very informative in detecting not human disease but human pathogens, so what is happening with vector-borne disease at the moment, &#x02026;, is our ability to detect viruses in the field&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(Academic scientist 1)</attrib></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;In terms of climate change eventually you have to bring in GP data because there is also lots of information about pre-existing diseases about people who have issues, chronic diseases issues, because you know that &#x02026; they are prone to be very vulnerable&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><attrib>(State government officer 4)</attrib></disp-quote></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-ijerph-14-00552"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to explore stakeholders&#x02019; needs and requirements for the development of climate change indicators, their view on robust indicators, and the purposes for which they would use indicators. Stakeholders use indicators for different purposes such as identifying trends over time and monitoring the impact of climate change, taking preventive actions, measuring adaptation, assessing public health plans, and as tools for communication. However, this largely depends on their requirements. </p><p>Our results revealed that stakeholders believed that there would be a tangible impact of climate change on human health and that indicators would be required to measure the impacts. As rising temperature is the environmental indicator most commonly cited in climate change studies [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], participants specifically mentioned increases of heat-related illnesses and death due to climate change. This is supported in the scientific literature which has reported increased heat-related health outcomes as a result of rising temperature [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. </p><p>Readily available and accessible data for monitoring the impact of climate change are mainly environmental indicators, such as temperature, rainfall, and air pollution data. Health outcome data presently collected in Australia include heat-related mortality and morbidity such as ambulance callouts and hospital admissions, and communicable disease data on food-borne and vector-borne diseases. Similar data are collected in other countries, and in the United Sates [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Canada [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and Europe [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], excess mortality and morbidity are being used as health indicators of climate change. However, ethics approval is required for accessing health data and resources also need to be made available to undertake relationship analysis to describe links between climate change and human health. The provision of useful environmental health indicators, will require the service of experienced epidemiologists who can undertake quantitative analysis of environment and health associations on a regular basis to capture trends in climate change-related health outcomes. </p><p>For the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, countries are expected to report progress on the United Nations SDG indicators, and resources should be specifically allocated for this purpose. The indicators include the number of deaths, missing persons, and persons directly affected by disasters, in addition to the proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The development of environmental health indicators of climate change will aid in monitoring the progress of the SDGs. According to the Australian Bureau of Transport Economics, flood has been the most costly disaster type in Australia, followed by severe storms and cyclones [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, data on human health impacts of floods can be difficult to source, although a study has shown that heavy rainfall and consequent extensive flooding in Queensland in 2010&#x02013;2011 attributed to 33 deaths [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The Insurance Council of Australia provides cost estimates of natural disasters such as death and injuries by hazard type [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and these could be a potential source of data on injuries and mortality from extreme weather events. </p><p>Indicators provide useful information for local governments when planning for climate change. Preventing development in areas prone to flooding and/or bushfire, and increasing community education and awareness regarding extreme heat, are examples of key priorities considered in the South Australian regional climate change adaptation plans [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, records of climate-related adverse events such as flood, bushfire, and storm are not kept in an inclusive database in South Australia. Rather, different organizations and departments keep these records. If these data were managed systematically and centrally, information may be more accessible and useful as indicators of climate change. </p><p>The results of this study have shown that the planning and implementation of interventions often requires an understanding of community resilience to extreme weather events, and it can be difficult to define the questions to ask community members to ascertain perceptions of risk and resilience. A recent study by Bene et al. focused on understanding the factors that influence people&#x02019;s resilience in fishing communities in Fiji, Ghana, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam that have experienced natural disasters in the past [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The authors used a self-assessment questionnaire built around the strategies adopted by households to respond to past floods and tropical storms. Questions focused on how people responded, how they would respond if such events were to happen again in the near future, and how they believed they would be able to recover. These type of questions can be informative and a starting point for local government surveys to gauge community resilience to severe weather events. </p><p>Participants explained that indicators should be: (i) based on available data; (ii) tailored for context; (iii) credible; (iv) represented spatially; and (v) specific. These criteria are similar, but not as wide-ranging, as those identified by other studies for environmental health indicators [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and climate change environmental health indicators [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Other criteria could also be considered such as cost effectiveness [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and the quality and integrity of the collected data [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>This study sought to explore the understanding of indicators development within a small group of stakeholders in South Australia. Others, interstate, may have different views or access to different data. Also, as weather and climate characteristics in South Australia can differ between states and regions, and the health burden related to climate change can also vary geographically, not all indicators suggested in this study are necessarily applicable to other areas. Nevertheless, the participants were from several different sectors comprising government, non-government, and academic institutions, thereby providing a wide-ranging picture of stakeholders&#x02019; needs for indicators and the issues that they face with the development process. Based on the similarities in the activities, needs, and issues of the participants in other states, the key findings may be useful to policymakers and stakeholders across Australia. Furthermore, given that climate change issues and the related adverse health outcomes have no borders, this study may have an even wider relevance. </p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-14-00552"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The study findings have shown the relevance of stakeholder engagement in the process of indicator development to assess their needs and the criteria that are required to ensure that the indicators are robust. The findings show that developing indicators for climate change is not a straightforward process. A range of issues were addressed and included the variability of risk factors for different regions, the potential lack of resources, and data and methodological issues. The four criteria that were of most importance for robust indicators were credibility, specificity, data availability, and being spatially represented. Indicators that seem to be easiest to use and to interpret by stakeholders, and which meet the above criteria, include: environmental indicators such as temperature and rainfall, health outcomes including heat-related mortality and morbidity, and notifications of climate-sensitive diseases. Local and state governments have paid special attention to identifying vulnerable groups; however, current indicators are not always useful in identifying the most vulnerable individuals who may be socially isolated, ill, or disadvantaged for reasons that may not be listed in current databases. The integration of resilience and vulnerability assessments is recommended to provide a more complete story for policy makers and planners in the health and emergency services to aid in the preparation, response, and recovery when facing climate change and future extreme events. This study shows a high level of stakeholders&#x02019; awareness on the health impacts of climate change and the need for indicators that can monitor health trends and inform policy making. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the participants who generously gave up their time to be interviewed.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Maryam Navi, Alana Hansen, Monika Nitschke, and Dino Pisaniello conceived and designed the study.
