<p class="p">This study sought to explore the understanding of indicators development within a small group of stakeholders in South Australia. Others, interstate, may have different views or access to different data. Also, as weather and climate characteristics in South Australia can differ between states and regions, and the health burden related to climate change can also vary geographically, not all indicators suggested in this study are necessarily applicable to other areas. Nevertheless, the participants were from several different sectors comprising government, non-government, and academic institutions, thereby providing a wide-ranging picture of stakeholdersâ€™ needs for indicators and the issues that they face with the development process. Based on the similarities in the activities, needs, and issues of the participants in other states, the key findings may be useful to policymakers and stakeholders across Australia. Furthermore, given that climate change issues and the related adverse health outcomes have no borders, this study may have an even wider relevance. </p>
