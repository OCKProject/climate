<p class="p">Readily available and accessible data for monitoring the impact of climate change are mainly environmental indicators, such as temperature, rainfall, and air pollution data. Health outcome data presently collected in Australia include heat-related mortality and morbidity such as ambulance callouts and hospital admissions, and communicable disease data on food-borne and vector-borne diseases. Similar data are collected in other countries, and in the United Sates [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], excess mortality and morbidity are being used as health indicators of climate change. However, ethics approval is required for accessing health data and resources also need to be made available to undertake relationship analysis to describe links between climate change and human health. The provision of useful environmental health indicators, will require the service of experienced epidemiologists who can undertake quantitative analysis of environment and health associations on a regular basis to capture trends in climate change-related health outcomes.
