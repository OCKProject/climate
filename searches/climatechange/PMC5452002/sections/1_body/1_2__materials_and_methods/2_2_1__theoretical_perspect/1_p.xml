Critical realism is a theoretical approach to data analysis concerned with characterizing the nature of reality, whilst acknowledging that a person’s “reality” is bounded by multiple meanings made available to them in the social context [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In this way, participants’ views are considered contingent upon locally available knowledge and, thus, analysis does not assume that data constitutes a direct reflection of reality. Rather, it presupposes that interpretation of data is required in order to develop a contextualized understanding of the underlying structures of the phenomenon under examination [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-14-00552" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In the present study, critical realism aids in understanding stakeholders’ views on the usefulness and development of indicators to measure the health impacts of climate change, backgrounded against the current social context.
