<p class="p">Discrete risk factors are salient in different areas of South Australia due to regional climate variability. While heatwaves occur across the state, there are specific areas prone to sea-level rise, floods, and bushfires. This may cause difficulties in the development and application of indicators. Although South Australian councils work together on climate change adaptation plans across broad regions, issues in local environments are different and councils do not necessarily face the same issues.</p>
