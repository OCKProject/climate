  <italic class="italic">“I think it is a good idea to have a report annually or every 2 years, that could be quite good if you decide on a very narrow band of the most important indicators, you could have then every ten years a bigger report which would be more meaningful for other indicators, how is it getting worse? Or can we actually adapt? These are really the questions and things that we have not noticed on a yearly level but you can see on a longer term”</italic>.
