<p class="p">Amazonia is a complex biome, and, just in floristic terms, it consists of areas covered either by forest (FT; 
 <italic class="italic">terra-firme</italic>), periodically inundated forested environments (

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Land-use change caused by agricultural expansion, logging, mining and energy production are responsible for more than 90% of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Therefore, the rapidity of environmental changes has increased the urgency of collecting, organizing and analysing biodiversity data to guide decision-making in conservation. Moreover, the NCPs are essential to human activities, and a better understanding of the range of ecosystem responses to climate change will help to improve the determination and the implementation of effective ecosystems management in a manner that promotes resilience [
