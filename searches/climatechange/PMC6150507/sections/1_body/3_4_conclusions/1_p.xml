<p class="p">Integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide frameworks for bridging climate change and socioeconomic projections with other analyses of vulnerability, impacts, adaptation opportunities and mitigation possibilities. The wild-caught commercial US Atlantic sea scallop fishery (

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], we reported on preliminary sensitivity studies using a new sea scallop IAM that incorporates: scallop recruitment and size-structured scallop population dynamics; ocean CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and climate change, ocean acidification impacts, fishery management, and fuel costs. For future external forcing over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, we utilize representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that provide internally consistent projections of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, ocean warming, population, economic development, and carbon tax. This framework and a generalized version of the IAM could be applied to other species with similar life history characteristics such as relatively sessile and size-structured population dynamics provided information was available on important model parameterizations such as growth and mortality rates and sensitivity to ocean acidification.
