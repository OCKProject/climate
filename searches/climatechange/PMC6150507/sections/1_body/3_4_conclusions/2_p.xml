<p class="p">The suite of possible scenarios presented here are intended to provide initial ways to consider the impacts of differing degrees of climate change and ocean acidification on a highly valuable, wild-caught, federally regulated fishery. Impacts on the fishery were substantially smaller for a moderate climate policy scenario (RCP4.5) in comparison to a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), showing the value of climate mitigation efforts. Ocean acidification may lead to shifts in the size structure of the scallop stock, with ensuing biological, fishery management and economic impacts (e.g. declining fishery revenue for smaller sized scallops). Model runs with increased management partially offset the decline in the scallop fishery, but do not fully protect the population from the long-term impacts of global change. The IAM simulations emphasize the benefits of sustained monitoring and adaptive management of the US scallop fishery to avoid the worst possible consequences of ocean acidification. Additionally, the development of this suite of model scenarios highlights the lack of empirical data on the potential impacts of ocean acidification on
