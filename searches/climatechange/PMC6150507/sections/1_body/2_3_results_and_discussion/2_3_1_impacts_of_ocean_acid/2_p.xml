<p class="p">In control experiments where management remains similar to what exists today, i.e., catch limits, regularly updated fisheries management targets, and area closures (e.g. similar to our high management scenario), and there are no impacts of ocean acidification and warming, biomass is likely to be stable through the end of century (blue curves in

With no climate or acidification impacts, a stable future of the scallop fishery is not surprising, given that current fisheries management targets under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act are designed such that harvest is maintained at a sustainable level into the future assuming no changes to biological parameters and fishery reference points [
