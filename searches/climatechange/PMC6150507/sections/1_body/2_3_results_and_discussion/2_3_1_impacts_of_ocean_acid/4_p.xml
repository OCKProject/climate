<p class="p">Larval mortality alone does not begin impacting scallop population dynamics until mid-century, when saturation state is low enough (~1.) that it begins influencing larval supply. Historically, the scallop subpopulation on Georges Bank has not shown a strong stock-recruit relationship [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The lack of a clear relationship is likely due to larval retention and saturation within the gyre over Georges Bank [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] rather than a function of larval supply. The IAM in its current form assumes that increases in larval mortality with ocean acidification [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] manifest in the population as a decline in recruitment [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], but this impact only becomes prominent on the more linear portion of the stock-recruit function. For example, because the Georges Bank stock-recruit function approaches its asymptote at a low biomass, under present day populations, a 50% increase in larval mortality on Georges Bank may only lead to a ~1.6% decline in recruitment [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The stock-recruit curve for the Mid-Atlantic subpopulation saturates much more slowly [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], so increasing larval mortality with ocean acidification has a greater relative impact on this subpopulation. At present, the Mid-Atlantic subpopulation is roughly 40â€“60% of the yearly combined Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank total stock biomass, depending on survey methodology [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Because recruitment impacts affect the subpopulations at different rates, declines due to larval mortality alone may change the spatial distribution towards larger relative populations on Georges Bank. However, declines due to ocean acidification on the whole stock are still not distinguishable from the interannual variability expected among different year-classes until the latter half of the century for the larval case L for RCP8.5 (red data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, top panel). With the addition of growth rate impacts and increased mortality of small scallops due to predation, the scallop resource is projected to decline faster under RCP8.5, leading to ~10%, and ~30%, reductions in biomass and landings, respectively by 2050, and ~50%, and ~70% by end of century (Figs
