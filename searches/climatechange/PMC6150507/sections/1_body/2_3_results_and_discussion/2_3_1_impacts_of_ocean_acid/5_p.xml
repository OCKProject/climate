<p class="p">In addition to declining overall biomass, changes in scallop population size distribution are evident with increased ocean acidification impacts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> illustrates the impacts of both ocean acidification on different life stages (described below, different panels) and management (described in section 3.2, solid vs. dashed lines) over time (colors) on scallop biomass size distributions. The solid lines for each panel of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>, colors vs. black). This shift towards a smaller sized population is a direct result of the positive feedback from the combined reduction in growth rates and increases in mortality of small scallops plus targeted harvests of the largest sized scallops.
