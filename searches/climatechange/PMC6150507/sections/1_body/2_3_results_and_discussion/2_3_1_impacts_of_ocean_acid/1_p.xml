Fuel cost, even when including both high prices and high carbon taxes, had minimal impact, because at current biomass and scallop price per pound, decisions on how many days to fish are not strongly influenced by fuel prices. Under scenarios where biomass declines to a small fraction of current levels and fuel costs increase dramatically (e.g. no set catch limits, high ocean acidification impacts, high fuel price growth rates, and high carbon taxes), increasing fuel costs do play a role in reducing the number of days fished.
