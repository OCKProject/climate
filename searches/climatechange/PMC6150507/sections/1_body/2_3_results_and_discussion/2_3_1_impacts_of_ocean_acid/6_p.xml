<p class="p">A population composed of smaller scallops has significant implications for the overall fishery. Under the highest ocean acidification impact—larval, growth, and juvenile mortality (L+G+P)–population distribution changes from shell height modes in 2020 at ~125mm and ~120mm for the Georges Bank and Mid-Atlantic populations, respectively, to ~110mm and 100mm by end of century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>, yellow lines). A reduction in larger sized scallops influences both the socio-economics and the population dynamics of the fishery. A mismatch between population size distribution and selectivity of scallop dredges and targeting over time reduces potential landings in the absence of changes to management gear regulation or targeting. Scallop dredges are currently federally regulated to have 4-inch diameter rings in order to select specifically for scallops larger than 102mm [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], so a reduction in the catch of U10 scallops (10 and under meats/lb) means that overall revenues are impacted when compared to lower OA impact scenarios. Biologically, scallop fecundity rates increase with age, size, and biomass, [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]; thus, a population of larger scallops can lead to increased recruitment if populations are limited by larval supply (e.g. Mid-Atlantic Bight).
