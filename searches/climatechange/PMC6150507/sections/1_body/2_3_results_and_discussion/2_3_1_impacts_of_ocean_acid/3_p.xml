<p class="p">When ocean acidification and warming impacts are added to the model, the future trajectory of the fishery changes, with declines projected in both stock and landings. Under RCP4.5 and high management, increasing ocean acidification impact has a small effect on the future of the fishery (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>), the resulting small declines in carbonate mineral saturation state from present-day conditions do not translate to major fishery impacts. However, under RCP8.5 and high management, because increases in atmospheric CO
