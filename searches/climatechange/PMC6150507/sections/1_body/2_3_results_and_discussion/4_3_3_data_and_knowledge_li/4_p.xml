For example, although the population submodel in the IAM incorporates increased larval mortality through effects on the stock-recruit relationship, larval and juvenile stages (under two-year-old scallops) are not explicitly modeled. An additional pre-recruit model, such as that described in Punt et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and environmental change, would better describe how increased larval or juvenile mortality might impact population-level recruitment. Finally, biological adaptation or acclimatization over time to increased ocean acidification stress could occur [
