 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Since the initial meta-analysis used in Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], several new experiments have been published within the scallop taxa. Lagos et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found that juvenile 
 <italic class="italic">Argopecten purpuratus</italic> was sensitive to ocean acidification, with reduced growth rates in experimental individuals compared to those reared under present day conditions. However, Ramajo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] found the opposite result, with increased growth and calcification rates of

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] found that 
 <italic class="italic">Argopecten irradians</italic> juveniles were sensitive to acidification, but this sensitivity manifested itself in reduced survival rates, rather than a reduction in growth rates. Older work by White et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] also found that larval

 <italic class="italic">irradians</italic> was sensitive to acidification that manifested in both reduced larval survival and calcification rates.
