 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and the additional studies above, experiments have mostly been conducted on estuarine or shallow water species, where seasonal or diel cycling may expose bivalves to low carbonate mineral saturation state under naturally varying conditions. These organisms may be more resilient to ocean acidification than those found in more stable, deeper continental shelf environments, like
