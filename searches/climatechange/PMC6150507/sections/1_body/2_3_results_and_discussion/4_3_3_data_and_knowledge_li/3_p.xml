<p class="p">A few studies have been conducted on a similarly long-lived Pectinid, 
 <italic class="italic">Pecten maximus</italic>, found in deep-water environments in the Northeast Atlantic. Experiments there have focused on the juvenile and larval life stages, and the swimming capability of adults, and they have shown mixed responses [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Sanders et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] found no impact of ocean acidification on juvenile 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maximus</italic> growth when food was not limiting. However, irrespective of treatment, growth as measured by changes in shell height was negligible over their 90-day study, suggesting a longer-term experiment might be needed to determine the effects ocean acidification on growth of long-lived species such as 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maximus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic>. Larval 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maximus</italic> life stages are also sensitive to ocean acidification, with experimental declines in survival, shell height, and increases in deformity rates with decreasing carbonate mineral saturation state [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Currently, results from Andersen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] are used to link carbonate mineral saturation state to recruitment in the IAM [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Although Schalkhausser et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] found the swimming behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maximus</italic> was sensitive to ocean acidification and reduced clapping force, a repeated experiment on a different subpopulation showed a different, yet still acidification-sensitive swimming response [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Populations sourced from Norway were more sensitive and exhibited reduced clapping force, while 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maximus</italic> individuals sourced from France were only sensitive to acidification when incubated under warm water conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The high variability in response within a single species suggests that studies on the response of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> to ocean acidification are warranted to improve future projections of populations under future climate scenarios.
