<p class="p">In order to maintain a sustainable fishery into the future, it is important that all stakeholders involved in both the management and exploitation of the fishery understand possible futures of the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery and the potential impacts of decision-making. In this work, we expand on the model described in Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] by incorporating different future scenarios to inform planning for long-term change. Moreover, new elements have been added to the model to include the economic development associated with different growth and emissions scenarios (the RCP pathways); economic development was previously held constant in Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. We designed a decision-support framework that explores multiple combinations of potential future scenarios to provide an ensemble of model output varying major influences on the fishery as a whole. In this manuscript, we describe a subset of those scenarios to address the following questions: how might the future trajectory of the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery change under future climate warming and ocean acidification? How do differing management regimes influence the long-term outcomes of the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery? In this work, we designed future scenarios that incorporate potential acidification impacts, future climate scenarios that affect economic development, fisheries management, and changing fuel costs (described in more detail below).
