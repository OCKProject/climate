<p class="p">Marine mollusks, specifically bivalves, are impacted in many ways by acidification. Their often complex, multi-stage life-cycle leads to potential bottlenecks where the chemical environment is particularly important, such as during metamorphoses from various larval stages prior to settlement [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Many species have shown increased larval mortality due to acidification, and larvae that survive often have deformed shell structures that suggest potential reductions in fitness during juvenile or adult stages [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Experimental manipulations of juvenile and adult bivalves suggest reduced growth and calcification rates under acidified conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Further, shellfish predator-prey interactions are hypothesized to be influenced by acidification, due to decreased shell thickness and strength [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and decreased behavioral responses to predators [
