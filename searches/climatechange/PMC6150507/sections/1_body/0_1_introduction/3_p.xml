<p class="p">The US Atlantic sea scallop (
 <italic class="italic">Placopecten magellanicus</italic>) is an ideal test species to apply integrated assessment modeling to project the impacts of global change on a wild-caught fishery. The 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery is one of the most valuable wild-caught fisheries in the US, regularly worth roughly $500 million (USD) in ex-vessel revenue [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This fishery was severely overfished in the early to mid-1990s, but was rapidly rebuilt by the early 2000s using a combination of fishing effort reductions, gear restrictions, and rotational as well as long-term fishery closures [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Because the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery is currently sustainable, stakeholders and managers have the opportunity to consider the impacts of long-term environmental change on the fishery stock, yield, and economic benefits.
