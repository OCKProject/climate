<p class="p">Ocean acidification, the process where increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], has already been implicated in negative impacts on the aquaculture industry on the US West Coast [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Laboratory studies for a number of other economically important marine species suggest ocean acidification has the potential to significantly impact fisheries landings and revenues regionally and around the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Marine mollusks appear to be particularly sensitive to ocean acidification due to the sensitivity of the calcification process to seawater chemistry during shell building [

 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Mollusks make up approximately 22 and 15% of the wild-caught fisheries yield globally and in the US, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]; therefore, understanding sensitivities of wild-caught fisheries to ocean acidification is an important step in the long-term sustainable management of these species.
