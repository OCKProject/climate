<p class="p">The scallop population submodel is a size-based matrix population model that was simplified from the sea scallop fisheries management model, the Scallop Area Management Simulator (SAMS). The SAMS model splits the scallop population into a number of distinct geographic units with individual populations and growth rates based on historical survey data. The reduced population submodel used in the IAM described in Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] separates the sea scallop population into two geographic units, Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and tracks each population with unique population parameters. The population submodel includes terms for recruitment, growth, maximum size, and natural, incidental, discard, and fishing mortalities, growth rates, maximum sizes, and recruitment.
