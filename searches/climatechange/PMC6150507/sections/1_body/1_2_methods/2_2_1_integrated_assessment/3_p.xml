<p class="p">The economic submodel is based on economic modeling of the sea scallop fishery by the New England Fisheries Management Council [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The submodel uses price and cost models that include terms for landings, per-capita disposable income (an indication of economic development), scallop imports and exports, fuel costs, days at sea, and number of crew members. From yearly estimated price and costs, the economic model determines the optimal number of days at sea to fish based on a rules analysis maximizing net profit and adhering to management set maximum allowable biological catch (ABC) that is determined as the catch associated with a precautionary fishing mortality (F
 <sub class="sub">ABC</sub>) that is a slight reduction in the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (F
 <sub class="sub">MSY</sub>). The economic submodel is linked to the scallop population model through the management set limits on catch and the scallop pricing analysis, and linked to the biogeochemical model through the RCP scenarios.
