<p class="p">Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) for the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> fishery. This model combines elements of fisheries management models that include matrix population models and socio-economic models with reduced-form biogeochemical modeling to project the future fishery response to changes in environmental and economic conditions. The IAM incorporates ocean acidification and warming into fisheries projections through altered growth rates and larval survival. Based on economic viability and stock biomass, the IAM forecasts fisheries yield and economic benefits under future conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. We briefly summarize the model design below. A conceptual illustration of the IAM is given in
