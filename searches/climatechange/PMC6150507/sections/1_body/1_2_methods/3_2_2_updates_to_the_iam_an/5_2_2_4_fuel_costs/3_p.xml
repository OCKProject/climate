<p class="p">Some of our scenarios overlap in design with the results presented in Cooley et al. [

Similar scenarios include forcings of RCP8.5, ABC only management, larval mortality and growth rate impacts, and no fuel cost increases. However, these overlapping scenarios differ substantially in underlying socio-economic conditions because this analysis includes the economic development associated with the RCPs that were held constant in Cooley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. For example, all four RCPs project increasing GDP, population, and PCDI (
