 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]) and stochastically varying future temperatures determined from the projections shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>. All figures shown summarize an ensemble of 100 model runs for each scenario, and the results for each scenario are presented as the mean Â± one standard deviation from the ensemble. The stochastic model runs for all scenarios yielded 25,600 individual simulations.
