<p class="p">The “high” impact case is defined by other possible impact pathways beyond just growth and calcification. Recent work on mollusk species suggests that predator-prey interactions such as behavior, cue detection, or shell thickness may be altered as a result of ocean acidification [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Mollusk shells are the first line of defense for many species, and if shell thickness is compromised, scallops may be more susceptible to predation [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Early studies from 
 <italic class="italic">Pecten maximus</italic>, a similar species of scallop found in the Northeast Atlantic, suggests that swimming behavior may be compromised due to ocean acidification, reducing the escape performance of scallops under future climate scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The majority of predation on juvenile 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicus</italic> (20-90mm shell height) is due to 
 <italic class="italic">Cancer spp</italic>. crabs; these scallops generally can escape sea stars (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Asterias</italic> spp.) by swimming. Scallops larger than 70-90mm are currently invulnerable to 
 <italic class="italic">Cancer</italic> predation due to their thick shells [
 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. We hypothesize that ocean acidification may reduce both shell strength and swimming ability, thus reducing the scallops’ defenses against both type of predators. Because there are no empirical relationships to estimate these effects, in the “high” impact case we increase natural mortality of small scallops (&lt; 90mm) proportionally with the change in saturation state.
