 <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] from the CMIP5 database. The projected SST fields from RCP2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5 were interpolated to a 1°x1° grid consistent across all models. We quantified regional trends in area-weighted mean monthly SST fields from a 10° x 10° area containing the Georges Bank and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions in the Northwest Atlantic. We quantified anomalies from the mean temperatures of the first five years of future projections (2006–2010), and applied stochastic temperature trajectories from the projection distribution derived from the model ensemble to the biogeochemical submodel (
