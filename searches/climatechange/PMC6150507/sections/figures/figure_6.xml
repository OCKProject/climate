  <title class="title">Scallop whole stock biomass from RCP8.5 (top panel) and RCP4.5 (bottom panel) under the highest ocean acidification impacts (increased larval mortality, reduced growth rates, and increased mortality due to predation) with varying management strategies: No set catch limit, maximum allowable biological catch (ABC), varying fisheries reference points (ABC+F
   <sub class="sub">MSY</sub>), and area closures (ABC+F
   <sub class="sub">MSY</sub>+10% closure).

  <p class="p">The purple line/band illustrates the same dataset as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Bold line illustrates the mean, and shaded area is the 95% confidence interval for 100 model runs with stochastic recruitment. The 2000â€“2012 period is hindcast with observed recruitment.
