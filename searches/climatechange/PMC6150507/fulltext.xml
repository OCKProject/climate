In this work, we build upon a previously published integrated assessment model of the US Atlantic Sea Scallop (<italic>Placopecten magellanicus)</italic> fishery to determine the possible future of the fishery under a suite of climate, economic, biological, and management scenarios. We developed a 4x4x4x4 hypercube scenario framework that resulted in 256 possible combinations of future scenarios. The study highlights the potential impacts of ocean acidification and management for a subset of future climate scenarios, with a high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions case (RCP8.5) and lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and climate mitigation case (RCP4.5). Under RCP4.5 and the highest impact and management scenario, ocean acidification has the potential to reduce sea scallop biomass by approximately 13% by the end of century; however, the lesser impact scenarios cause very little change. Under RCP8.5, sea scallop biomass may decline by more than 50% by the end of century, leading to subsequent declines in industry landings and revenue. Management-set catch limits improve the outcomes of the fishery under both climate scenarios, and the addition of a 10% area closure increases future biomass by more than 25% under the highest ocean acidification impacts. However, increased management still does not stop the projected long-term decline of the fishery under ocean acidification scenarios. Given our incomplete understanding of acidification impacts on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic>, these declines, along with the high value of the industry, suggest population-level effects of acidification should be a clear research priority. Projections described in this manuscript illustrate both the potential impacts of ocean acidification under a business-as-usual and a moderately strong climate-policy scenario. We also illustrate the importance of fisheries management targets in improving the long-term outcome of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery under potential global change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000192</institution-id><institution>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA12NOS4780145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooley</surname><given-names>Sarah R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the NOAA Grant # NA12NOS4780145 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.noaa.gov">www.noaa.gov</ext-link>) and by the WestWind Foundation.

Laboratory studies for a number of other economically important marine species suggest ocean acidification has the potential to significantly impact fisheries landings and revenues regionally and around the world [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Marine mollusks appear to be particularly sensitive to ocean acidification due to the sensitivity of the calcification process to seawater chemistry during shell building [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mollusks make up approximately 22 and 15% of the wild-caught fisheries yield globally and in the US, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; therefore, understanding sensitivities of wild-caught fisheries to ocean acidification is an important step in the long-term sustainable management of these species.</p><p>Marine mollusks, specifically bivalves, are impacted in many ways by acidification. Their often complex, multi-stage life-cycle leads to potential bottlenecks where the chemical environment is particularly important, such as during metamorphoses from various larval stages prior to settlement [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many species have shown increased larval mortality due to acidification, and larvae that survive often have deformed shell structures that suggest potential reductions in fitness during juvenile or adult stages [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Experimental manipulations of juvenile and adult bivalves suggest reduced growth and calcification rates under acidified conditions [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further, shellfish predator-prey interactions are hypothesized to be influenced by acidification, due to decreased shell thickness and strength [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], reduced escape performance [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and decreased behavioral responses to predators [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The US Atlantic sea scallop (<italic>Placopecten magellanicus</italic>) is an ideal test species to apply integrated assessment modeling to project the impacts of global change on a wild-caught fishery. The <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery is one of the most valuable wild-caught fisheries in the US, regularly worth roughly $500 million (USD) in ex-vessel revenue [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This fishery was severely overfished in the early to mid-1990s, but was rapidly rebuilt by the early 2000s using a combination of fishing effort reductions, gear restrictions, and rotational as well as long-term fishery closures [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery is currently sustainable, stakeholders and managers have the opportunity to consider the impacts of long-term environmental change on the fishery stock, yield, and economic benefits.</p><p>In order to maintain a sustainable fishery into the future, it is important that all stakeholders involved in both the management and exploitation of the fishery understand possible futures of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery and the potential impacts of decision-making. In this work, we expand on the model described in Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] by incorporating different future scenarios to inform planning for long-term change. Moreover, new elements have been added to the model to include the economic development associated with different growth and emissions scenarios (the RCP pathways); economic development was previously held constant in Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We designed a decision-support framework that explores multiple combinations of potential future scenarios to provide an ensemble of model output varying major influences on the fishery as a whole. In this manuscript, we describe a subset of those scenarios to address the following questions: how might the future trajectory of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery change under future climate warming and ocean acidification? How do differing management regimes influence the long-term outcomes of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery? In this work, we designed future scenarios that incorporate potential acidification impacts, future climate scenarios that affect economic development, fisheries management, and changing fuel costs (described in more detail below).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2 Methods</title><p>Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) for the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> fishery. This model combines elements of fisheries management models that include matrix population models and socio-economic models with reduced-form biogeochemical modeling to project the future fishery response to changes in environmental and economic conditions. The IAM incorporates ocean acidification and warming into fisheries projections through altered growth rates and larval survival. Based on economic viability and stock biomass, the IAM forecasts fisheries yield and economic benefits under future conditions [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We briefly summarize the model design below. A conceptual illustration of the IAM is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0203536.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203536.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Conceptual illustration of the integrated assessment model.</title><p>Red arrows indicate connections between submodels, black arrows indicate population submodel, green arrows indicate decision-making and socio-economic submodel.

The SAMS model splits the scallop population into a number of distinct geographic units with individual populations and growth rates based on historical survey data. The reduced population submodel used in the IAM described in Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] separates the sea scallop population into two geographic units, Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and tracks each population with unique population parameters. The population submodel includes terms for recruitment, growth, maximum size, and natural, incidental, discard, and fishing mortalities, growth rates, maximum sizes, and recruitment.</p><p>The biogeochemical submodel is a two-box ocean model (surface and bottom waters) with separate sub-modules for Georges Bank and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions. Carbonate chemistry is explicitly modeled including terms for air-sea gas exchange, primary production, and calcium carbonate production in the surface box, and biological export and organic matter remineralization in the bottom water box. The two-box model also includes terms for temperature and salinity to determine seasonal changes in stratification and mixing, and the biogeochemical model parameters were trained with data from the 2000&#x02013;2010 period. The biogeochemical model in the IAM is linked to the population model through temperature and calcium carbonate mineral saturation state impacts on adult growth and larval mortality. The biogeochemical model is linked to the socio-economic model through the future climate scenarios, from the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which set future atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p><p>The economic submodel is based on economic modeling of the sea scallop fishery by the New England Fisheries Management Council [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The submodel uses price and cost models that include terms for landings, per-capita disposable income (an indication of economic development), scallop imports and exports, fuel costs, days at sea, and number of crew members. From yearly estimated price and costs, the economic model determines the optimal number of days at sea to fish based on a rules analysis maximizing net profit and adhering to management set maximum allowable biological catch (ABC) that is determined as the catch associated with a precautionary fishing mortality (F<sub>ABC</sub>) that is a slight reduction in the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (F<sub>MSY</sub>). The economic submodel is linked to the scallop population model through the management set limits on catch and the scallop pricing analysis, and linked to the biogeochemical model through the RCP scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Updates to the IAM and future projections</title><p>To explore the future of the US Atlantic sea scallop industry under climate scenarios over the next century, we identified four major areas of interest: 1) potential ocean acidification impacts, 2) future climate scenarios that incorporate economic development, 3) fishery management scenarios, and 4) future fuel costs. Below, we describe the major features of each scenario.</p><sec id="sec005"><title>2.2.1 Ocean acidification impacts</title><p>Climate and biogeochemical scenarios were developed from the IPCC AR5 RCP scenarios. Major biogeochemical influences include atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oceanic temperatures.

The projected SST fields from RCP2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5 were interpolated to a 1&#x000b0;x1&#x000b0; grid consistent across all models. We quantified regional trends in area-weighted mean monthly SST fields from a 10&#x000b0; x 10&#x000b0; area containing the Georges Bank and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions in the Northwest Atlantic. We quantified anomalies from the mean temperatures of the first five years of future projections (2006&#x02013;2010), and applied stochastic temperature trajectories from the projection distribution derived from the model ensemble to the biogeochemical submodel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, SST).</p><fig id="pone.0203536.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203536.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>External drivers of integrated assessment model.</title><p>A) Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), B) change in sea surface temperature from 2000&#x02013;2006 (mean &#x000b1; SD) from 10 global earth system models in the 10x10 degree region containing the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank scallop populations, C) US per-capita disposable income trajectories corrected to 2011 USD, and D) carbon tax converted to potential diesel fuel tax associated with each RCP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0203536.g002"/></fig><p>Four sets of increasing biological impacts were simulated representing none, low, medium and high impacts. &#x0201c;No&#x0201d; impact is defined as maintaining constant growth rates and recruitment throughout the simulation independent of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>. Although no studies to date regarding ocean acidification response have been published on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic>, from other bivalve species, we expect that adult growth or calcification rates and larval survival may be negatively impacted by rising CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. &#x0201c;Low&#x0201d; impacts of ocean acidification are defined as reductions in larval survival with carbonate mineral saturation state alone, while &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; impacts are both reductions in larval survival with saturation state and decreased growth and calcification rates, as described by Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as a function of saturation anomaly.</p><p>The &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; impact case is defined by other possible impact pathways beyond just growth and calcification. Recent work on mollusk species suggests that predator-prey interactions such as behavior, cue detection, or shell thickness may be altered as a result of ocean acidification [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mollusk shells are the first line of defense for many species, and if shell thickness is compromised, scallops may be more susceptible to predation [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Early studies from <italic>Pecten maximus</italic>, a similar species of scallop found in the Northeast Atlantic, suggests that swimming behavior may be compromised due to ocean acidification, reducing the escape performance of scallops under future climate scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The majority of predation on juvenile <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> (20-90mm shell height) is due to <italic>Cancer spp</italic>. crabs; these scallops generally can escape sea stars (e.g., <italic>Asterias</italic> spp.) by swimming.

Historically, the scallop subpopulation on Georges Bank has not shown a strong stock-recruit relationship [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The lack of a clear relationship is likely due to larval retention and saturation within the gyre over Georges Bank [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] rather than a function of larval supply. The IAM in its current form assumes that increases in larval mortality with ocean acidification [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] manifest in the population as a decline in recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but this impact only becomes prominent on the more linear portion of the stock-recruit function. For example, because the Georges Bank stock-recruit function approaches its asymptote at a low biomass, under present day populations, a 50% increase in larval mortality on Georges Bank may only lead to a ~1.6% decline in recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The stock-recruit curve for the Mid-Atlantic subpopulation saturates much more slowly [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], so increasing larval mortality with ocean acidification has a greater relative impact on this subpopulation. At present, the Mid-Atlantic subpopulation is roughly 40&#x02013;60% of the yearly combined Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank total stock biomass, depending on survey methodology [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because recruitment impacts affect the subpopulations at different rates, declines due to larval mortality alone may change the spatial distribution towards larger relative populations on Georges Bank.

With the addition of growth rate impacts and increased mortality of small scallops due to predation, the scallop resource is projected to decline faster under RCP8.5, leading to ~10%, and ~30%, reductions in biomass and landings, respectively by 2050, and ~50%, and ~70% by end of century (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g004">4</xref>).</p><p>In addition to declining overall biomass, changes in scallop population size distribution are evident with increased ocean acidification impacts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005">Fig 5</xref> illustrates the impacts of both ocean acidification on different life stages (described below, different panels) and management (described in section 3.2, solid vs. dashed lines) over time (colors) on scallop biomass size distributions.

A reduction in larger sized scallops influences both the socio-economics and the population dynamics of the fishery. A mismatch between population size distribution and selectivity of scallop dredges and targeting over time reduces potential landings in the absence of changes to management gear regulation or targeting. Scallop dredges are currently federally regulated to have 4-inch diameter rings in order to select specifically for scallops larger than 102mm [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Larger sized scallops also receive a price premium [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], so a reduction in the catch of U10 scallops (10 and under meats/lb) means that overall revenues are impacted when compared to lower OA impact scenarios.

Although the &#x0201c;market chooses&#x0201d; scenario is unlikely to ever occur due to federal fisheries management regulations, the removal of a set catch limit is still an interesting exercise to highlight the value in the fisheries management process. Under the &#x0201c;no set catch limits&#x0201d; scenario, regardless of other possible impact pathways, there were dramatic declines in fishery biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g006">Fig 6</xref>). For orientation, the red curves in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g006">6</xref> correspond to the same cases (high management and high ocean acidification impact). Stock biomass was depleted by between ~30&#x02013;80% for &#x0201c;no set catch limits&#x0201d; cases when compared to a similar climate and ocean acidification impact scenario that includes management set catch limits. Initially, when catch limits are removed, there is a spike in landings and decline in biomass suggesting that there are untapped resources within the sea scallop stock in any given year (blue data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Beyond this initial spike, landings do not deviate from the similar climate-with-high-management scenario (purple data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007">Fig 7</xref>) until beyond 2050. As landings are similar for the first 40 years of simulation, revenues also do not deviate between the &#x0201c;market chooses&#x0201d; and high management scenario until the latter half of the century. However, because stock biomass is depleted, scallop vessels must fish nearly twice as many days at sea to maintain landings at the same level, leading to significant reductions in crew incomes when compared to scenarios with set catch limits. Because operating costs of the industry are taken from crew shares [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], after the initial spike, owner profitability remains largely similar between &#x0201c;market chooses&#x0201d; and management scenarios until landings and revenues deviate due to future climate impacts beyond 2050.</p><fig id="pone.0203536.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203536.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Scallop whole stock biomass from RCP8.5 (top panel) and RCP4.5 (bottom panel) under the highest ocean acidification impacts (increased larval mortality, reduced growth rates, and increased mortality due to predation) with varying management strategies: No set catch limit, maximum allowable biological catch (ABC), varying fisheries reference points (ABC+F<sub>MSY</sub>), and area closures (ABC+F<sub>MSY</sub>+10% closure).</title><p>The purple line/band illustrates the same dataset as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003">Fig 3</xref>.

Under RCP8.5 and high ocean acidification impacts, the highest level of management considered here increases the future biomass of the fishery compared to constant management targets and no closures. The fishery has slightly reduced landings due to a lower set catch limit from the initial 10% biomass closure beginning in 2012. However, the closure increases total biomass by more than 25% due to buildup of large scallops in the closed areas, and improves recruitment in the Mid-Atlantic region where a clear stock-recruit relationship has been observed [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0203536.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203536.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Contour plots of biomass at three different time points (2020, 2050, and 2100) for RCP8.5 (left panels) and RCP4.5 (right panels).</title><p>X-axes increase management levels from low to high as no set catch limit (None), allowable biological catch limits only (low), ABC and variable fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (YPR, medium), and ABC, YPR, and an additional 10% closed area (high).

Since the initial meta-analysis used in Cooley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], several new experiments have been published within the scallop taxa. Lagos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that juvenile <italic>Argopecten purpuratus</italic> was sensitive to ocean acidification, with reduced growth rates in experimental individuals compared to those reared under present day conditions.

The wild-caught commercial US Atlantic sea scallop fishery (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic>) is currently valuable, well managed, and healthy, but is also potentially sensitive to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, ocean acidification, and ocean climate warming [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In previous work [<xref rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we reported on preliminary sensitivity studies using a new sea scallop IAM that incorporates: scallop recruitment and size-structured scallop population dynamics; ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, biogeochemistry, and warming; and scallop fishery management rules and socio-economic drivers. Here we conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the scallop IAM exploring scenarios that vary atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and climate change, ocean acidification impacts, fishery management, and fuel costs. For future external forcing over the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we utilize representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that provide internally consistent projections of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, ocean warming, population, economic development, and carbon tax. This framework and a generalized version of the IAM could be applied to other species with similar life history characteristics such as relatively sessile and size-structured population dynamics provided information was available on important model parameterizations such as growth and mortality rates and sensitivity to ocean acidification.</p><p>The suite of possible scenarios presented here are intended to provide initial ways to consider the impacts of differing degrees of climate change and ocean acidification on a highly valuable, wild-caught, federally regulated fishery. Impacts on the fishery were substantially smaller for a moderate climate policy scenario (RCP4.5) in comparison to a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), showing the value of climate mitigation efforts. Ocean acidification may lead to shifts in the size structure of the scallop stock, with ensuing biological, fishery management and economic impacts (e.g. declining fishery revenue for smaller sized scallops). Model runs with increased management partially offset the decline in the scallop fishery, but do not fully protect the population from the long-term impacts of global change. The IAM simulations emphasize the benefits of sustained monitoring and adaptive management of the US scallop fishery to avoid the worst possible consequences of ocean acidification. Additionally, the development of this suite of model scenarios highlights the lack of empirical data on the potential impacts of ocean acidification on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> at the organismal, population, and community level including effects from recruitment and growth to predator-prey interactions. A suite of laboratory studies identifying the response of various <italic>P</italic>. <italic>magellanicus</italic> life stages to ocean acidification is a clear next step in determining the future of this valuable fishery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NOAA Grant NA12NOS4780145 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.noaa.gov">www.noaa.gov</ext-link>) and the WestWind Foundation and utilized data collected by the NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center as part of an ongoing mission to monitor and assess the Northeast Continental Shelf ecosystem.
