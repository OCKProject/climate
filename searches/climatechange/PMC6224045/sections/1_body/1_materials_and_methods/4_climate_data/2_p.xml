We used multi-model means from the extreme RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5 scenario and the conservative RCP 4.5 scenario. RCP 8.5 predicts a large increase in global temperatures though the year 2100 due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. RCP 4.5 predicts a milder increase in global temperatures through the year 2100 due to predicted future stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.
