<p class="p">Hatching success and emergence percentages were transformed using arcsine to normalize the data. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare hatchling production between regions and across nesting beaches within each region. Levene’s test, with center mean, found the variances for both hatching success and emergence success between nesting beaches in RN (p &lt; 0.01, both hatching success and emergence success) and BA (p &lt; 0.01, both hatching success and emergence success) to not be homogenous. Therefore, Tamhane’s T2 test was conducted to analyze how hatchling production may differ between nesting beaches within each region.</p>
