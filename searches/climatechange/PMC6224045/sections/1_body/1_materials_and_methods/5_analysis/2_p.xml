<p class="p">Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models in package “lme4” [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], with the binomial family in package lme4, were used to test the influences of local climate on hatching success and emergence success. Year was set as a. To best fit these models, hatching success and emergence success data were presented as successes and failures. For instance, hatching success consisted of the number of eggs that hatched versus those that did not, while emergence success consisted of the number of hatchlings that emerged from hatched eggs versus those that did not. Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) was used to identify the best model within each region. Using the best models, hatching success was projected into the future under conservative and extreme climate change scenarios for each region. Emergence success was not projected due to its potential to be heavily influenced by sand compaction, substrate type, and hatchling performance, which were not measured here [
