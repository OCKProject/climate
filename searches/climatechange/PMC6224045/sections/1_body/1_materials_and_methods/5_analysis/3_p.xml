<p class="p">The predictor variables used were: average air temperature (temp), accumulated precipitation (acc.rain), average precipitation (avg.rain), average humidity (humid), average solar radiation (rad), and average wind speed (wind). These predictors were explored at various temporal scales: the month nests were laid (0.climate variable), the month nests were laid and one-month prior (0.1.climate variable), the month nests were laid and two months prior (0.2.climate variable), two months prior to nesting (2.climate variable), and during the incubation period (inc.climate variable). Existent research has shown that air temperature and precipitation as well as humidity have significant influences on hatchling output due to the variability that may exist in moisture throughout the nesting season (i.e. dry and wet seasons) and across regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Therefore, accumulated precipitation, average precipitation, and humidity predictors were combined with average air temperature during incubation to explore their combined effects on hatchling production. Precipitation projections were presented as mm/day. Therefore, to project accumulated precipitation, these values were converted into mm/month.
