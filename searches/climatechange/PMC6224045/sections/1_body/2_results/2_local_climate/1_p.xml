<p class="p">Hawksbill sea turtles nest during the warmer months of the year throughout RN and BA (October–May) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). RN is the warmest of the two regions being closer to the equator than BA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). In RN, the warmest month is February (27.64°C ± 0.4), while in BA the warmest month is March (27.35°C ± 0.64) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). During February and March, adult females are still nesting in high proportions, but hatchlings are incubating and emerging from nests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). The wettest month in both RN and BA is May, with an accumulated precipitation of 200.92 mm ± 153 in RN and 190.35 mm ± 129 in BA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>). Likewise, May had the highest average precipitation in both RN and BA, with 0.31 mm/day in RN and 0.26 mm/day in BA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). In May, there is no nesting in BA and nesting is finishing in RN, but hatchlings are still incubating and emerging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). RN receives more solar radiation than BA, likely due to its proximity to the equator (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3D</xref>). The month with the highest average solar radiation in RN is October (1907.7 KJ/M
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ± 198.7), while in BA it is January (1754.2 KJ/M
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ± 158.2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3D</xref>). In RN, there is no nesting in October, when solar radiation is highest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3D</xref>). On the other hand, January is when solar radiation and nest proportions are at their highest in BA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3D</xref>). BA is more humid than RN and May is the most humid month in both RN (79.2% ± 2.05) and BA (80.3% ± 5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3E</xref>). In May, nesting has ended in BA and is ending in RN, but hatchlings are still incubating and emerging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3E</xref>). RN is windier than BA, with October being the windiest month in both RN (5.29 m/s ± 0.5) and BA (1.82 m/s ± 0.34) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3F</xref>). There is no nesting in October in RN, while October has the lowest proportion of nests in BA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204188.g003" class="xref">Fig 3F</xref>).
