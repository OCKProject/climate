<p class="p">We used the best fit models describing hatching success at RN (air temperature during incubation in combination with average precipitation during the month nests were laid) and BA (air temperature during incubation in combination with accumulated precipitation during the month nests were laid and two months prior) as well as our climate deltas to project hatching success throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Our models predicted average hatching success to decrease in both RN and BA thought the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. By 2100, hatching success in RN is projected to decrease from an average across the study period of 75.2% to 72.6% under RCP4.5 and to 70.9% under RCP8.5 (
