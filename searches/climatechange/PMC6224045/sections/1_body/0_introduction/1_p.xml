<p class="p">Changes in climate have already impacted the physiology, phenology, behavior, distribution, and reproduction of many species [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Species that are expected to be most vulnerable are those that are heavily reliant on environmental temperature for their life history traits and/or those that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This is the case for sea turtles, as their life history, physiology, and behavioral traits are heavily influenced by environmental temperature, particularly while their eggs are incubating [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Successful incubation of sea turtle eggs typically occurs within a specific thermal range of 25°C– 35°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], with reduced embryonic development and altered hatchling physiology being observed at extreme temperatures [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Moisture content also influences embryos with reduced development being observed when conditions are too moist/dry [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Further, the sex of sea turtle hatchlings is temperature dependent, with warmer sand temperatures producing a higher proportion of female hatchlings [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, any changes to the nesting environment can alter hatchling phenotype and survival, impacting sea turtle populations [
