<p class="p">The impacts of climate change on hatchling production have already been observed through skewed sex ratios, malformations in hatchlings, lowered hatching success, and altered hatchling behavior [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Therefore, concern exists over the potential impacts of climate change on hatchling production and population stability [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Most studies to date have focused on potential impacts of climate change on the primary sex ratio of hatchlings being produced at nesting grounds [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. However, recent studies have highlighted the fact that the effects of climate change on hatchling production may be of greater concern to population stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Only a few studies to date have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on hatchling production [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], indicating a potential variability in the influence and vulnerability of the different species and populations of sea turtles to various environmental and climatic factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Indeed, the various species and populations of sea turtles have different thermal tolerances [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] and are also influenced differently by local climate variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Further, as sea turtle species typically prefer to nest at different locations within a nesting beach (i.e. hawksbills nest on vegetation, whereas loggerheads nest on more open areas) [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], it is likely that there is variability on how they can cope with different environmental conditions. This indicates that local climate drivers of hatchling output need to be explored at a species and nesting beach level.
