<p class="p">To provide further insights into how sea turtle populations may be impacted by climate change, we expand from previous studies and explore the influences of five different climatic variables (air temperature, accumulated and average precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed) on hawksbill sea turtle, 
 <italic class="italic">Eretmochelys imbricata</italic>, hatchling production from the coast of Brazil. This allowed us to determine which variable(s) and combination of variables have the most influence on hatchling production of this critically endangered species, to identify nesting regions that are most susceptible to climate change, and to project future hatching success throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under extreme and conservative climate change scenarios.
