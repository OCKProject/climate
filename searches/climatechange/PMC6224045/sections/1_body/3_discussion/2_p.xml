<p class="p">Hawksbill turtles are known to nest near or within vegetation, further from the high-water mark than loggerhead turtles [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Sand temperatures tend to be significantly cooler in areas with vegetation than in open areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Indeed, mean incubation duration for hawksbill turtles is longer than for loggerhead turtles in Bahia, Brazil, indicating that hawksbill eggs are incubating at cooler temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Sea turtle nesting behavior and historical nest placement may drive the tolerance of species to thresholds of incubating parameters (i.e. moisture, temperature) and drive the adaptive differentiation of species at fine spatial scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Indeed, it was found that hatchlings of females nesting on a naturally hot (black sand) beach survived better and grew larger at hot incubation temperatures compared to the offspring of females nesting on a cooler (pale sand) beach nearby [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Thus, it could be speculated that the thermal tolerances of loggerhead eggs incubating in Brazil are higher than those for hawksbill turtles. Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of hybridization between hawksbill and loggerhead sea turtles with 42% being morphologically assigned as hawksbills [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Hatching success between hybrids and their parental species are not significantly different, however hybrid emergence success were found to be lower than the parental species [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Therefore, these hybrids may endure in Brazil likely impacting global sea turtle populations. Despite this potential, the responses of hybrids to climate remain unknown.
