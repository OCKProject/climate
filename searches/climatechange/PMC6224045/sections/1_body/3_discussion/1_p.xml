<p class="p">Hawksbill nesting beaches in Brazil are projected to experience decreases in hatching success of up to 11% by 2100 due to warming air temperatures and increases in precipitation. Across all regions, higher hatching success was observed in cooler and wetter conditions. A positive influence of precipitation on hatching success was found across Brazil and within both regions, which may be a reflection of an absence of adequate moisture levels at these nesting grounds, where most of the nesting (January to March) occurs during the drier months of the season [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Hawksbills nesting in Bahia experience different climatic conditions than those nesting in Rio Grande do Norte despite their proximity. In particular, the rate of precipitation differs between the regions throughout the nesting season, which is likely the reason for the different influences of precipitation. Bahia had a slightly higher average hatching success than Rio Grande do Norte during the study period, yet Bahia is predicted to experience stronger declines by 1.3–7.5%. Bahia is the main nesting region for hawksbills in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Being a critically endangered species, these predicted decreases are concerning. As climate change progresses and conditions become wetter, there is a potential for further reductions in hatchling production, since very wet conditions can result in soil saturation or a rise of the water table level displacing air between sand particles, suffocating embryos and resulting in clutch failure [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This is the case for loggerhead turtles in Brazil, where a negative effect of precipitation on loggerhead hatching success was found for nesting beaches in Bahia that are shared between loggerhead and hawksbills, specifically in Praia do Forte and Santa Maria [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. This is likely a reflection of the fact that the peak for loggerhead turtle nesting in Brazil overlaps with the wettest months (October to December) of the season and these areas already experience high levels of rain [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Interestingly, although hawksbill and loggerhead turtles have some common nesting areas in Bahia, Brazil [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], the relationship between precipitation and hatching success for these species are different. This variability may be driven by differences in nesting seasonality.
