<p class="p">With projected changes in climate, it is important to understand the climatic thresholds for various species of sea turtles to better project potential impacts and to inform management. Thermal tolerances are known to vary between species of sea turtles [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and are also likely to vary between populations and within nesting grounds as a reflection of strong site fidelity by individual females. Future studies should also explore whether sea turtles are able to locally adapt to other environmental conditions (i.e. moisture) and integrate these findings into models that predict population responses to climate change. Similarly, a better understanding of the interacting and synergetic effects of various environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, etc.) is necessary. The effects of temperature on hatchling output is relatively well understood [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] with recent advancements in our understanding of the effects of moisture [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. However, other less studied environmental variables may be affecting the reproductive output of sea turtles at nesting grounds. Here, we also explored how solar radiation and wind speeds may influence hatchling output. Although our study suggests air temperature and precipitation to be most significant, solar radiation, was a good predictor and had a negative effect on emergence success across Brazil and within both regions. High solar radiation can enhance the effect of warm air temperatures by warming the sand, and thus heating nests beyond the thermal threshold, potentially negatively impacting hatchling production [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Further, sand temperatures that are too warm, and consequently very dry, can reduce successful hatchling emergence since it can cause nests to cave-in making it difficult for hatchlings to emerge [
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Ultimately, if nesting and incubating conditions are not favorable, as a consequence of climate change or other threats, sea turtles will need to respond and adapt accordingly.
