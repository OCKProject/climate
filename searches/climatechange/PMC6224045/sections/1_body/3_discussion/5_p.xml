<p class="p">Unfortunately, the future adaptive capacity of sea turtles may be hindered by the reduction of available nesting grounds from rises in sea-levels and the ever-expanding development along coasts [

 <xref rid="pone.0204188.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. This can be achieved by protecting nesting beaches (i.e. conservation easements, reducing coastal development, enforcing wildlife laws and regulations), limiting and regulating development (i.e. implementing setback regulations), and by maintaining the nesting habitat (i.e. maintain native vegetation, minimize the use of shoreline hardening structures) [

The climate models presented here offer a great starting point to understand local resiliency, however a better understanding of the synergistic effects of climate as well as non-climate threats is need to improve our understanding of how species will be impacted by projected climate change.
