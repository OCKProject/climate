  <title class="title">Spatial distribution of effective and non-effective protected areas (PAs) in the Brazilian Amazon.</title>
  <p class="p">Effective PAs are those supposed to buffer species against effects of climate change as assessed by a null model that allocated each PA within the Amazon keeping its size, shape and orientation. These results are based on a combination of four climatic variables and a high-emission greenhouse gases scenario (RCP8.5) for 2070. See text for further details. All shapefiles are from the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.</p>
