<p class="p">We obtained federal and state spatial data on PAs from the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio,

We overlapped the polygons of PAs to our 0.5 x 0.5° grid. Not all overlapping cells were considered “protected”; only those for which PAs polygons overlapping regions covered more than 30% of the surface of the cell. We followed this procedure to keep the real proportion of the Brazilian Amazon territory covered by PAs. In this study, the network of the Brazilian Amazon PAs was therefore composed by 79 federal and 53 state PAs, covering approximately 24% of the biome (
