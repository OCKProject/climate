<p class="p">We assessed the effectiveness of PAs by comparing the number of critically-exposed species inside each PA to the estimated number of species predicted that should be found inside the PA according to a null model. That null model randomly allocated PAs within the Amazon while retaining their size, shape and orientation (see Lemes et. al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]). We restricted the possibilities of randomly allocated PAs to sites (cells) not covered by any PA already established. Hence, when a PA was randomly allocated to a site already covered by a PA, a new randomization run were done. In doing so, we took into account the currently established network of Amazon PAs in the randomization process. That incorporation of a realistic baseline on the randomization process has never been attempted before, to our knowledge, but adds substantial light on the predicted outcomes on PAs effectiveness in face of climate change. We used the equation below to compare the observed species richness in each PA (OR) against the species richness (RR) obtained by 1000 (n) randomization runs. A given PA was considered effective when OR ≥ RR at least 95% of runs, or p ≤ 0.05 (
