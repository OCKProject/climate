<p class="p">Data on species distribution was obtained from range maps for terrestrial mammals on the International Union for Conservation of Nature website (IUCN version 2015–2; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data</ext-link>). We followed Paglia et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] to account for taxonomic differences and to check for species occurrences in the Amazon. A total of 376 mammal species inhabiting the Brazilian Amazon were analyzed in this work. Species were considered endemic to the Amazon when occurrences in Brazil were limited to that biome, according to Paglia et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. We overlapped each range map into an equal-area grid of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees of latitude/longitude (around 55 km at equator line; see comment on spatial resolution in the ‘Climatic data‘ section) containing 12,807 and 1,767 cells covering the full extent of species’ range and the extent of the Brazilian Amazon, respectively. We assumed that a species was present in a cell if any portion of its distribution map overlapped the respective cell.
