<p class="p">We obtained bioclimatic variables relative to current (1950–2000) and future (2050 and 2070) periods from the WorldClim database (version 1.4;

 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We used future climate projections derived from 17 downscaled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models from CMIP5 (AOGCMs; ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M) for one high-emission greenhouse gases scenario (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs 8.5; IPCC 2013) to quantify species local exposure to climate change. Some climate models may have low accuracy for the Amazon. In order to address this issue, we removed the models (GFDL-CM3 and INMCM4) that exhibited the largest variation in relation to predicted average values of climate variables. By excluding models with extremely divergent predictions, we avoided substantial bias in the analysis. The most extreme greenhouse gas emission scenario RCP8.5 was chosen because it encompasses all set of greenhouse gases emission scenarios used in the IPCC’s fifth Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Also, the chosen scenario has predictions most likely to be supported in the future, because trends on greenhouse emission since 2000 have been closer to those predicted by RCP8.5 than any other hindcast [
