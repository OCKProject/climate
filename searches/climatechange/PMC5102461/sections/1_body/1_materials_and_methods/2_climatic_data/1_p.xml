<p class="p">We selected four bioclimatic variables to quantify mammal exposure to climate change: mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of warmest month, and precipitation seasonality. Those variables encompass multiple climate dimensions representing general trends, variation (seasonality) and extremes (maximum) climatic relevant aspects that affect, direct or indirectly, species distribution and survival (see

Although other factors might also affect species distribution, several studies indicate that climate is the main driver of species distribution at large spatial scales [
