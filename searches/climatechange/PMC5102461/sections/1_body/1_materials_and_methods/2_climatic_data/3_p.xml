<p class="p">Current and future bioclimatic variables were obtained at the resolution of 10 arc-minutes (~ 0.16째 of latitude/longitude) and rescaled to our grid resolution using mean of values within 0.5째 cell (see Hijmans et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]). Weather stations are sparsely distributed on fairly populated regions, such as the Brazilian Amazon. The WorldClim climate data are therefore interpolated from probably insufficient records, which enhances uncertainty on expected values. Higher resolution climatic data (0.1째 cell, for example) do not necessarily imply on a higher data quality and might be pure statistical artefacts. In addition, the 0.5째 resolution was chosen to counterbalance the inaccuracies associated with applying high resolution climatic data to a relatively coarse IUCN species distribution maps [
