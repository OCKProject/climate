<p class="p">To identify the most exposed cells to climate change across species geographic range, we followed three steps. First, we used current climate conditions (1950–2000) within the entire species’ range to identify the amplitude (maximum and minimum limits) of each climatic variable to which species are currently exposed within its range. This procedure is useful to identify areas within species’ ranges where future climate conditions will probably exceed current climatic variability. In addition, IUCN distribution maps are built upon minimum convex polygons of species’ occurrence records. Therefore, using the extreme climate values of environmental conditions associated with species’ records allows us to avoid uncertainties related to dataset source, because occurrence records and IUCN range maps would probably produce similar results.</p>
