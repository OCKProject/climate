<p class="p">Second, for each grid cell and each climatic variable we calculated the standard deviation of projections derived from the 15 AOGCMs. The mean of each cell-based projection minus their corresponding standard deviation was considered the value of each climatic variable in the future (2050 and 2070). In doing so, we incorporated the variation from different future climate projections by assuming the value that a particular climatic variable may achieve in future as the mean minus one standard deviation. Therefore, our approach is extreme because we selected the highest emission greenhouse gas scenario, but conservative for assuming the lower values of climate variables.</p>
