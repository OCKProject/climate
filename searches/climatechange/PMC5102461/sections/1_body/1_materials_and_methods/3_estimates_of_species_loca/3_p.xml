<p class="p">Third, we identified cells within species’ range in which future climate conditions may exceed the current climate conditions experienced by the species. Species for which future climate conditions exceed their current tolerances in more than 80% of their ranges were designated as “critically-exposed”. We chose this percentage because significant reductions (≥ 80%) of a species range is one criteria used by IUCN to qualify a species as critically endangered (IUCN 2016). Endemic species were also analyzed separately, to assess their exposure in relation to other groups. Finally, we mapped areas with highest concentration of critically-exposed species to each climatic variable separately and thereafter, we combine these maps to build a “combined” exposure map.</p>
