 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Thus, even small changes in climate might have deleterious consequences on species long-term survival because high conservatism of upper thermal limits prevent species to develop adaptations to increased temperature that will probably exceed their thermal tolerance [

 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>, since shallower temperature gradients within tropical lowlands prevents species to disperse and track other suitable climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The combination of increase of non-analogous climate conditions, higher sensitivity, narrower climatic niches and geographic distributions, and higher species richness, set the tune for tropical species being more vulnerable to climate change [
