<p class="p">Exposure to climate change varies geographically within species’ ranges because projected changes on temperature and precipitation are unevenly distributed around the globe (see Garcia et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). Therefore, estimating how much and where populations are most at risk is paramount to understand the effects of climate change on species. It is also critical to evaluate if these population in different parts of a species’ range are safe; and, therefore, we need to look at Protected Areas (PAs). PAs play a central role in averting negative consequences of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. They are supposed to sustain different microclimate conditions in heterogeneous habitats that are essential for species to avoid extreme climatic conditions [
