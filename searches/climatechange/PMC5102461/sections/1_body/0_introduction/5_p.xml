<p class="p">Here, we quantified mammal local exposure to climate change across speciesâ€™ range and identify which areas in the Brazilian Amazon have the highest concentration of species with critical exposure to different climatic variables. We also assessed the effectiveness of Amazon network of PAs in buffering the impacts of climate change on species. To do so, we compared the number of critically-exposed species found in each PA to the expected values of species richness estimated by a null model that randomly allocated PAs within the Amazon while maintaining their size, shape and orientation. Our null models overcomes some previous shortcomings (see Lemes et. al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and Ferro et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]) by explicitly incorporating the current distribution of the network of Amazon PAs in randomization process, making the null model more realistic.
