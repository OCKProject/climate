 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Tropical species tend to live closer to their maximum critical temperature (maximum temperatures that a species can withstand without additional energy expenditure to keep body temperature constant; [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]). Thus, even the slighter amount of climate change projected for the tropics might exceed species thermal tolerance. It follows that the additional amount of energy expenditure necessary to maintain homeostasis reduces energy available for other functions, such as reproduction. That decreased available energy may also lead to fitness reduction, loss of genetic variation at population level and possibly local extinction [
