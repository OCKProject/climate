<p class="p">In summary, in this work we highlight a general pattern of areas in which species with the potential to be critically-exposed to effects of climate change are concentrated. In addition, we showed that the current network of PAs has small effectiveness to protect these species. Such an examination provides the first step to a more comprehensive assessment of species vulnerability, and might guide conservation decisions on where to take place on-the-ground actions aiming at minimizing negative effects of climate change on species.</p>
