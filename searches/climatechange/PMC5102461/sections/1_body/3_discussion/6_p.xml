<p class="p">We also found that the magnitude of species exposure to climate change was uneven across the Brazilian Amazon territory. Species inhabiting south-western regions are likely to experience high magnitude of climate change in the future. Although the number of critically-exposed species may be higher at other regions, Amazon south-western species are also threatened by massive deforestation rates. That region is popularly known as the “Arc of Deforestation” [
