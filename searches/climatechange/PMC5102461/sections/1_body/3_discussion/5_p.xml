<p class="p">Protected Areas are the keystone of current conservation strategies and play a vital role in buffering species against extreme exposure to climate change. PAs may be the only guarantee that species’ habitat will remaining in the future, since Amazon have been more and more fragmented [

Protecting species habitat, even when it may be highly exposed to climate changes, is fundamental to increase species’ resilience against climate change. PA’s support different microhabitats conditions and resources that are essential for species avoiding be high exposure, for example, behaviorally avoid overheating by moving between microhabitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Therefore, protecting species’ habitat in PA’s is fundamental to increase species resilience against climate change at the same time that avoid other synergetic threats as deforestation. In addition, our findings strengthen the need to assess the PAs effectiveness using dynamic approaches, since climate is predicted to continuously change from 2050 to 2070. Those expected changes impose new challenges for establishment of PAs or adaptation of current PAs network.
