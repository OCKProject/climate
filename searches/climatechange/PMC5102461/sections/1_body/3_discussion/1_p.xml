<p class="p">In this paper, we quantified mammal local exposure to climate change and identified areas in the Brazilian Amazon with the highest concentrations of critically-exposed species. Further, we highlighted that these species are barely represented by the Amazon network of Protected Areas. Exposure was not equal along the speciesâ€™ range, implying that some populations will be more at risk than others. On average, 85% of the Amazon mammals will be exposed in more than 80% of their ranges by 2070. That percentage is even higher for endemic mammals; almost all endemic species are predicted to be exposed in more than 80% of their range. The ability to identify populations at higher risk is paramount to implement proactive on-the-ground conservation actions, aiming to increase population resilience against negative effects of climate change [
