<p class="p">Among the most exposed endemic species, Primates will likely be the mammalian group most vulnerable to climate change. Besides living in areas where greater climate change is expected, Primates in the Amazon are climatic and geographically restricted and thereby expected to be more sensitive to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0165073.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In addition, these species will probably be unable to keep pace with climate change even at relatively low magnitude of climate change due to high velocity of climate change expected in the tropics and poor dispersal abilities [
