<p class="p">However, exposure itself does not mean vulnerability. Although our results highlight a general pattern of local climate exposure in the Amazon, the overall picture of species vulnerability depends ultimately on their sensibility and adaptability to new climate conditions [

Although exposure represents only one distal component that affect species vulnerability, it constitutes a first-order assessment to identify where species are more potentially vulnerable to climate change, particularly when data on species sensitivity and adaptive capacity are scarce [
