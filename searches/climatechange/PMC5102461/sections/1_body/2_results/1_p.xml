<p class="p">Our results indicated that 46% (year 2050) and 85% (year 2070) of all species were exposed to novel climate conditions in more than 80% of their ranges, although different climatic variables revealed contrasting patterns of exposure (

However, climate variability within speciesâ€™ range (maximum and minimum values) was higher for precipitation compared to temperature, which might have affected differential exposure (
