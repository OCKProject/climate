  <title class="title">Number of critically-exposed mammals in the Brazilian Amazon exposed to four climatic variables taken together.</title>
  <p class="p">Species were considered “critically-exposed” when future climate exceeds the current climate variability for more than 80% of their range. These results are based on a high-emission greenhouse gases scenario (RCP8.5) for 2050 and 2070. Climatic variables were mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of warmest month, and precipitation seasonality.</p>
