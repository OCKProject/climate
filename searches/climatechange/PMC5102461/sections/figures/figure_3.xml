  <title class="title">Magnitude of temperature exposure of critically-exposure mammals in the Brazilian Amazon.</title>
  <p class="p">Areas with highest concentrations of species exposed to low and large magnitude of temperature are shown in blue and red, respectively. Areas with lowest concentration of species exposed to largest magnitude of temperature are shown in yellow. The Amazonian “arc of deforestation” is indicated in gray (dashed line). These results are based on an ensemble of 15 climate models for a high-emission greenhouse gases scenario (RCP 8.5) for 2070. All shapefiles are from the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.</p>
