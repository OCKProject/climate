  <title class="title">Areas in the Brazilian Amazon with highest number of critically-exposed species in relation to four climatic variables separately and taken together and uncertainty maps (standard deviation) from 15 climate models for the Brazilian Amazon.</title>
  <p class="p">Species were considered “critically-exposed” when future climate exceeds the current climate variability for more than 80% of their range. Colors close to red indicate localities with higher number of species. These results are based on a high-emission greenhouse gases scenario (RCP8.5) for 2050 and 2070. All shapefiles are from the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.</p>
