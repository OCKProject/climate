<p id="Par30" class="p">Most participants identified the fisher as the principal predator of the marten. Other predators of marten that were recognized by participants were, in decreasing order of frequency: raptors, grey wolf (
 <italic class="italic">Canis lupus</italic>), Canada lynx (
 <italic class="italic">Lynx canadensis</italic>), red fox, coyote (
 <italic class="italic">Canis latrans</italic>), the domestic dog (
 <italic class="italic">Canis lupus familiaris</italic>) and other martens. Among the birds of prey, some participants noted that they were mostly owls, including great horned owl (
 <italic class="italic">Bubo virginianus</italic>), together with eagles (bald eagle, 
 <italic class="italic">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</italic>; golden eagle, 
 <italic class="italic">Aquila chrysaetos</italic>), falcons and hawks. Participants pointed to increased observations of bald eagles, golden eagles and owls. For wolves, coyotes, foxes and lynxes, participants indicated that these would mainly prey on young or martens caught in traps, while the fisher would probably have difficulty catching live adults. The presence of coyote is relatively recent in the region, since it arrived in Témiscamingue (zones 1 and 2) about 15 years ago. Trappers have indicated that it is mainly concentrated in agroforestry environments. They also pointed out that wolf and lynx populations have been increasing throughout the region for several years. Participants had more difficulty identifying predators of the fisher. They consider that because of its size, rapidity, ferocity and ability to climb trees, it can flee most other carnivores. However, they pointed out that fisher mortality must occur mainly among the young, which can be caught more easily by canids such as wolves, coyotes and foxes, or by lynxes. Some have mentioned that wolves and coyotes mostly eat fishers when these are caught in traps. Other potential sources of mortality in fishers that were cited by participants are human, birds of prey, mainly great horned owl that preyed upon the young, and infections that were incurred from porcupine spines. It has also been mentioned that fishers eat one another when defending their territories where they are very numerous. Several trappers reported that fisher and marten populations were also influenced by competition from lynx.
