<p id="Par24" class="p">Participants have pointed out that the fisher is very opportunistic and eats whatever it encounters. It is a known predator of the North American porcupine (
 <italic class="italic">Erethizon dorsatum</italic>), but this species is not its main food source. Like the marten, the fisher hunts hare, squirrels, gallinaceous birds, small mammals, and small birds. Because of its size and strength, the fisher can access a greater diversity of prey than can marten, including (semi-)aquatic animals (fish, beaver, muskrat [
 <italic class="italic">Ondatra zibethicus</italic>], mink [
 <italic class="italic">Neovison vison</italic>]) and larger-sized terrestrial animals, such as woodchucks (
 <italic class="italic">Marmota monax</italic>), striped skunk (
 <italic class="italic">Mephitis mephitis</italic>), farm chickens (
 <italic class="italic">Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>), domestic cats (
 <italic class="italic">Felis silvestris catus</italic>), and even red fox (
 <italic class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</italic>). Fishers also feed upon moose carcasses or animals caught in traps, including martens. Most participants also pointed out that the fisher also eats live martens and is one of the latterâ€™s principal predators. Like the marten, the fisher also eats berries.
