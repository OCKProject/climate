<p id="Par21" class="p">According to the participants, the marten feeds primarily on squirrels and other small mammals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The term “mouse” was used generically to refer to several small mammals, including voles, shrews and other unspecified species. Squirrels included several species of Sciuridae, such as the red squirrel (
 <italic class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</italic>), the large flying squirrel (
 <italic class="italic">Glaucomys sabrinus</italic>) and the striped chipmunk (
 <italic class="italic">Tamias striatus</italic>). Marten also hunt snowshoe hare (
 <italic class="italic">Lepus americanus</italic>) and gallinaceous birds, including ruffed grouse (
 <italic class="italic">Bonasa umbellus</italic>) and spruce grouse (
 <italic class="italic">Falcipennis canadensis</italic>), especially in winter. Ruffed grouse catches were attributed to hunting under the snow, but the marten also consumes the eggs and preys upon the young of this species. Further, participants felt that the marten’s ability to climb trees also allowed it to feed upon small perching birds. Other dietary components that were cited by participants included carcasses of moose (
 <italic class="italic">Alces americanus</italic>) and beaver (
 <italic class="italic">Castor canadensis</italic>), animals that had been caught in traps, and red raspberries (
 <italic class="italic">Rubus idaeus</italic> L.).

  <p id="Par22" class="p">[The marten, she eats a lot of mice. A year where you have a lot of mice – and this is a 3-year mouse cycle – the marten will raise four young, (…) but the following year you will have practically no babies. The squirrel is also a feast for the marten: when you have the marten, you do not hear squirrel calls.] [E1-Z2]</p>
