<p id="Par9" class="p">During the 1970s, the fisher experienced periods of low abundance in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. This was attributed to over-exploitation of its fur and habitat loss [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Since the early 2000s, the populations appear to have recovered and the interest of trappers in the fisher has intensified, resulting in a substantial increase in fisher pelt sales, especially in Quebec [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Sales of fisher pelts apparently indicate that their geographical distribution could be expanding towards the northeast. This change in fisher distribution would thus result in greater overlap with martenâ€™s range in habitats that are undergoing natural [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] or anthropogenic disturbances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. The objective of this study was to document the local knowledge of trappers in western Quebec (Canada), where distributions of fisher and marten are sympatric, to identify factors that could explain variation in populations of the two species and the interactions between them.
