<p id="Par18" class="p">We interviewed the participants in semi-directed individual interviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. This is a flexible survey technique that offers possibilities for acquiring additional information, within a familiar exchange framework [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. We conducted 41 interviews with Indigenous (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 27) and non-Indigenous (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14) trappers. Indigenous trappers were members of the Anishnaabeg communities of Kebaowek (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5), Kitcisakik (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 17), Timiskaming First Nation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) and Wolf Lake (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1). Most participants were men (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 38) over the age of 40 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 37). Geographic areas were delineated a posteriori in order to group participants with consistent information: Zone 1 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8), Zone 2 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14), Zone 3 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14) and Zone 4 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The activities of one participant covered the entire study area. Interviews were conducted in French, English or Anishnaabemowin, depending upon the preference of each participant. Anishnaabemowin interviews were conducted in the presence of a contact person with whom the participants were familiar and who could provide translation. Codes that were used to identify participants corresponded to their status (AT, RT, Ex or E), followed by a number corresponding to the order in which they were encountered, and the area to which they could relate (Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4).
