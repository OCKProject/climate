<p id="Par57" class="p">Climate change and human activity have led to changes in abundances of other species, which in turn may influence the population dynamics of fisher and marten. Raccoon and coyote populations have increased in the northern part of their ranges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. Populations of bald eagles and other raptor species have appeared to be recovering naturally throughout North America, since the use of DDT was discontinued [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>]. All of these changes appear to be detrimental to marten, which would increase the abundance of predators and competitors while leading to marten habitat degradation at the same time. The fisher would be less affected, having fewer predators than marten.
