<p id="Par53" class="p">Trappers who were interviewed in this study were concerned about marten populations, a species that is particularly vulnerable to habitat alterations caused by logging operations. Concerns were expressed about the lack of protective cover, which has been incurred through the increase in hardwood species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>] and reductions in coarse woody debris (CWD) on the ground surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. The marten has long been perceived as being dependent upon mature and aging conifer stands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. These stands generally provide greater quantities of CWD than do younger stands, forest plantations and intensively managed stands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]. CWD provides subnival spaces that can be used by marten [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. Subnival spaces are particularly important for prey accessibility and provide protection against predation, together with resting sites for thermoregulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>]. Consequently, habitat use by marten is mainly dependent upon the internal structure of the forest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Fishers, in contrast, appear to be able to exploit a greater diversity of habitats, including more open forest environments, the edges of agricultural environments, and even urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. Fishers are not necessarily old-growth forest specialists, and are known to utilize young forests, mixedwood stands and ecotones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. A study that was conducted in 2016 in New York State [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>], however, showed that occupation of the territory by the fisher was positively influenced by proportions of coniferous and mixedwood forests, but negatively affected by the density and proportion of agricultural environments. Like marten, the fisher likely would be more dependent upon the structure of the forest than on the age or type of settlement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Participants also pointed out that mustelid habitats were especially consistent with those of their main prey: snowshoe hares, squirrels and other small mammals. These prey species and, therefore, fisher and marten, require coarse woody debris, vegetation cover, and structurally complex forests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. This complex structure is encountered mainly in old-growth forests, but may also be present in younger stands that have suffered windfalls or insect outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>].
