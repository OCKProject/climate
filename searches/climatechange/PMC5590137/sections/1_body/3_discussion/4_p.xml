<p id="Par55" class="p">More generally, participants reported that the return of martens after logging was more rapid in mixedwood than in softwood stands. Most mixedwood harvest cuts are partial cuts, while softwood stands are cut more intensively. In 2005, Potvin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>] determined that cut mixedwood stands had higher lateral cover and higher regeneration compared to cut conifer stands. Forest management influences populations of competitors and even predators of marten and fisher. Lynx, wolf and coyote probably benefited indirectly from forest management, which favoured their main prey, including snowshoe hare and moose [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. Marten would thus be the victim of apparent competition [
