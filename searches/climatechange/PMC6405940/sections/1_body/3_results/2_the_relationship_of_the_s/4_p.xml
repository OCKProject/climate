 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> which is due to the much fewer members of the ensemble for the CESM simulations. Based on the results of the PlaSim simulations assuming a linear relation between the stretching rate and the relative vorticity, the slopes of the linear fits to the ensemble mean data and the corresponding correlation coefficients are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The slopes are similar in values to those obtained from the PlaSim simulations with a mean of approximately [6–7] × 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> day, and, furthermore, all of them are on the order of magnitude of the slope found for the relation of the stretching rate and the relative vorticity in Section
