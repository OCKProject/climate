 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration scenario as a 50-year-long plateau with constant CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration which is followed by a doubling of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration from 360 ppm to 720 ppm over 100 years. For illustration, see the bottom panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. This implies an increase of about 6 °C in the ensemble mean of the global mean surface temperature in the simulations (see the top panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The transient time is clearly visible as all of the realizations converge to a stationary state approximately after year 30. This time-independent state lasts up to year 50. The ensemble standard deviation of the global mean surface temperature, that characterizes the internal variability of the climate, is 0.09–0.13 °C.
