<p id="Par22" class="p">PlaSim is an intermediate complexity climate model with scalable and modular structure, therefore, it is an ideal tool to study the large-scale features of the climate dynamics, see, e.g. refs

 </sup>. PlaSim is based on the moist primitive equations and contains parametrization for the unresolved processes. For the details see ref.

 </sup>. In this study for an ensemble of 110 climate realizations the default PlaSim setup is used at T21 horizontal resolution (corresponding to about 5.6° × 5.6° on a Gaussian grid with 64 × 32 grid points) with 10 sigma levels and 10 minutes of time resolution.
