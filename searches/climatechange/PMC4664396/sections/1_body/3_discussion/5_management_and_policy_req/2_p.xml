<p class="p">Ecological niche modeling is a cost-effective, easy and early warning system that allows the identification of areas at risk from a potential invasion, thus giving the opportunity to prioritize the region and target management actions as well as investment of resources in those certain regions. There is an urgency to set up long-term monitoring studies on 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> populations to understand the invasion patterns, its impact on native species and economy that will allow better understanding for future management of this highly invasive land snail. In order to control the spread of the existing 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> populations, and to prevent further invasions in India, we consider that the results of this study should be taken into account when identifying vulnerable areas and making management decisions for control of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in India.
