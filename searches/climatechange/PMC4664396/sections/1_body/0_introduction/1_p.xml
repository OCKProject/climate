<p class="p">One of the greatest threats to global biodiversity, agriculture, livelihoods, human and animal health, and forestry is invasive alien species [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Ever-growing international trade, increased transportation and deliberate introductions have facilitated invasions at an unprecedented rate across the globe [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Another factor that has great implications for biodiversity, environment and human health is climate change. Invasive alien species acting synergistically with climate change might be expected to have much larger impact on local ecosystem than either acting alone [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that climate change will aggravate the impacts of “non-native/exotic/alien” species naturalization and subsequent invasion across communities and ecosystems in the new ranges, thus threatening native biodiversity [
