High risk of invasibility under climate change was seen mainly in Daman and Diu (Union Territory), Bihar, Odisha, Lakshadweep Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, parts of Karnataka, Jharkhand, Nagaland and Assam (

Expansion might occur in Jharkhand, Lakshadweep Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Gujarat and Karnataka under RCP 4.5 scenario. Under RCP 6.0, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Jharkhand were highly vulnerable. Under RCP 8.5, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bihar and Odisha have high risk of invasion. The risk of invasion is very low under all the three scenarios for the Central Indian region where there is high summer temperature and low rainfall and high altitude regions with cold climate in the Himalayas. It is interesting to note that the two states Tripura and Goa the invasion risk under all future climate scenarios is either very low or nil (
