<p class="p">Evaluation results were based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the regularized training gain. The ROC curve corresponds to the relationship between 1-specificity (false positive rate) and sensitivity (true positive rate;

The evaluation of regularized training gain of each variable was performed using the Jack-knife method, where variables were individually assessed, generating a model with only one variable at a time, to estimate how much information a model delivered (
