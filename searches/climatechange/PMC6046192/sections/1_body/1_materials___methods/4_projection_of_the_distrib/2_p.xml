<p class="p">To predict possible huemul environment distribution shifts, either in relation to their current location or to suitable habitat, estimated models were converted to binary maps (0, not suitable; 1, suitable). Next, we used a threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity to balance commission and omission errors (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu, White &amp; Newell, 2013</xref>). Projections for years 2050 and 2070 GCM models were added to generate a concordance map with values ranging from 1 (where just one model estimated habitat suitability) to 5 (where all models match). Then, we used only the estimated concordance area of three GCMs. The resulting map of current estimated huemul distribution was compared to its distribution proposed by
