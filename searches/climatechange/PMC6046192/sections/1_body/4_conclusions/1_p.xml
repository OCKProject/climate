<p class="p">To address huemul conservation and probable effects of climate change, conservation recommendations should focus on areas that currently have no or a low degree of protection, but which have a high potential for suitable huemul habitat in the future. For example, areas between Puelo and General Carrera Lakes, and the western portion of Mu√±oz-Gamero peninsula are a priority because they are sites predicted by our model to be less affected by climate change in terms of their suitability for this deer.</p>
