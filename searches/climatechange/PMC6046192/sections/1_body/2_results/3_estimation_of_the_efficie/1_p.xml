We found at least six large areas of high suitability that are currently not protected, and which are situated near towns, cities, and other human perturbed areas (i.e., cattle ranching and forestry plantations): (1) the area adjacent to Nevados de Chillán, (2) the area around San Martín de los Andes, (3) a large area beginning at the north end of Puelo Lake, south through the mountain range reaching the northern shore of General Carrera Lake, (4) the area located from the southern shore of General Carrera Lake to Bernardo O’Higgins National Park, (5) small areas located outside of Torres del Paine National Park, and (6) the last suitable area located on a group of islands near Muñoz-Gamero peninsula (52°32′0″S &amp; 73°13′0″W).
