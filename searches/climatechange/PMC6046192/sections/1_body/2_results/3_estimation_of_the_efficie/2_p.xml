<p class="p">Under climate change projections RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, protected areas would only cover 38.57% and 34.94% for 2050, and 30.79% and 31.94 for 2070 of huemul potential suitable habitat. This phenomenon is more intense if when comparing with the current total estimated area, where protection goes lower than 16% for the total potential huemul distribution (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">5</xref>). In all future scenarios, the only remaining areas that would be unprotected were: (1) a small portion southward Nevados de Chillán, (2) one area western of San Martín de los Andes, (3) the area between Puelo and General Carrera Lakes, but more discontinuously than in current state, and (4) the area near Muñoz-Gamero peninsula.
