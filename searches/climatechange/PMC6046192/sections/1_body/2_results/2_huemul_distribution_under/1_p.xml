<p class="p">Distribution models under climate change predicted a 59.86% habitat loss estimated in scenario RCP4.5 for year 2050, and a 58.57% loss for 2070. For the RCP6.0 scenario predicted a 60.26% reduction in the estimated area for 2050 and 64.34% loss for 2070 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Along with these reductions in the area of suitable habitat, a southwards contraction in huemul distribution in all proposed scenarios was predicted. Reduction was most dramatic at Nevados de Chillán, where the suitable area almost completely disappeared (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, under all scenarios, estimated distribution areas have a reduction in their eastern portions, but an expansion to west; this effect is more marked in projections for the year 2070 of the RCP4.5 and 6.0 models (
