<p class="p">The model AUC was 0.96, indicating a high predictive value. Variables contributing the most in the model training were: seasonality of temperature (0.67), annual precipitation (0.59), and seasonality of precipitation (0.57). When analyzing the variables together, those ones containing the most information were annual precipitation (1.70), seasonality of precipitation (1.74), and precipitation of the coldest quarter (1.76;
