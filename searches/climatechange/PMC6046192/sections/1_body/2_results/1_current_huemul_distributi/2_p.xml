In addition, it was possible to observe three large areas that contained the greatest habitat suitability: (1) an isolated area in Nevados de Chillán, (2) a large continuum running from San Martín de los Andes in Argentina (40°09′28″S &amp; 71°21′12″W) and ending at General Carrera Lake (46°30′0″S &amp; 72°00′0″W), and (3) an area expanding continuously southward and splitting into two branches, one following the eastern edge of the Andes into the Argentine side as far as Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, and the second running along the southern channels and fjords of Chilean coastal Patagonia through Bernardo O’Higgins National Park (51°2′20″S &amp; 73°7′27″W).
