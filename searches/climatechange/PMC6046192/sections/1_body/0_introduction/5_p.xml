<p class="p">Because huemul is a late Pleistocene relic when cold and dry climatic conditions prevailed (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mar√≠n et al., 2013</xref>), current warming might be a serious threat for its persistence. Therefore, it is important to estimate probable negative effects of climate change on ecological projected parameters such as shifts in its future distribution range. Thus, our objectives were: (1) to estimate the current huemul distribution through a species distribution model (SDM), using climatic variables that could determine its presence; (2) to project current SDM into the future under different climate change scenarios; and (3) to estimate the efficiency of current protected areas in Chile and Argentina for both current huemul protection, and under projected climate change scenarios that potentially shift its distribution range.
