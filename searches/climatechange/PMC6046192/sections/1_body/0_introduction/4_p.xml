<p class="p">One of the largest mammals of temperate forests of the southern Neotropical region is the huemul (
 <italic class="italic">Hippocamelus bisulcus</italic>), an endemic deer found in Chile and Argentina (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corti et al., 2011</xref>). This ungulate is distributed across 2,000 km in the southern part of the Andes mountain range (
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vila et al., 2010</xref>). Here it is associated with sub-Antarctic forests dominated by beech tree species (
 <italic class="italic">Nothofagus</italic> spp.), low density understory, and periglacial areas (
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vila et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, huemul is classified as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), currently being the most threatened deer in the Neotropics (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IUCN, 2016</xref>), where it is considered a flag and umbrella species throughout its distribution range (

 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quevedo et al., 2017</xref>). Identified threats to huemul include habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, diseases and competition from domestic livestock, dog predation, and introduction of exotic species (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corti, Wittmer &amp; Festa-Bianchet, 2010</xref>). Nowadays, it is estimated that there are less than 2,000 individuals and their distribution range has been reduced by 50% in relation to their historical range (
