 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Coetzee, 2017</xref>). However, because of climate change, some species, both animals and plants, will modify their distributions in response to new conditions, most often dispersing in search of more suitable environments (

 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hovick et al., 2016</xref>). Under this scenario, many species would be pushed to change their distribution range and thus increase population fragmentation and habitat loss, in turn reducing survival and increasing extinction probability at local levels (
