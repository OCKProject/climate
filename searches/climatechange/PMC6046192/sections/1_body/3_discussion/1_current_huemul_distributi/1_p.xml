<p class="p">The binary map of suitable huemul habitat distribution agreed in almost 50% with the one 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IUCN (2016)</xref> estimated. However, our current distribution model corresponded to historical distribution boundaries described for huemul, ranging from Cachapoal River (34°10′0″S) in the north to Brunswick Peninsula at the southern limit (53°52′0″S, 
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vila et al., 2006</xref>). Areas of highest suitability for huemul presence were always in the southern Andes Mountains, which agrees with 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quevedo et al. (2017)</xref> findings for the Valdivian Ecoregion, and with 
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vila et al. (2006)</xref> for the total distribution. This mountain range is dominated by tree species of genus

 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donoso, 1987</xref>), which seem a fundamental component for huemul diet and shelter (
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vila et al., 2010</xref>). Current discrepancy of protected areas with estimated huemul distribution has also been recorded in other Neotropical ungulates, such as pudu (

 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the findings of this research are important to improve the efficiency of conservation areas for species under similar circumstances of huemul, prioritizing sites suitable for animals with the potential of being resilient to climate change (
