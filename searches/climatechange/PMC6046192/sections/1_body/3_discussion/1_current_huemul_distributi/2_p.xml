<p class="p">The total calculated suitable habitat area was subdivided into three main sectors: (1) Nevados de Chillán, (2) North Patagonia (centered on Puelo Lake), and (3) South Patagonia, including the Chilean fjords. This subdivision was consistent with huemul phylogeographic information (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marín et al., 2013</xref>), where a similar distribution pattern was obtained of three geographically separated populations. Huemul’s current distribution is most probably an outcome of the Last Maximum Glacier (

 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Woolbright et al. (2014)</xref> indicated that species surviving glacial events, subsequently expanded from nucleus areas or refugia, but because of changes in environmental conditions, they fragmented their distribution after their expansion. This has also been described in other ungulates (i.e., mountain goats
