<p class="p">The current distribution model showed that there is suitable habitat for the huemul in 69 protected areas of Chile and Argentina. These are mainly found in the foothills of the southern Andes and fjords of western coastal Patagonia. However, these areas protect only 36.18% of the total estimated huemul distribution area, and thus are inadequate if we consider all the threats that this deer faces within and outside protected areas (

The area between Los Alerces National Park and General Carrera Lake has a low level of protection, which is of special concern considering that it represents an important area for huemul persistence. It represents the biogeographic limit between two clades (
