<p class="p">The predicted reduction in suitable habitat for huemul (ca. 56–64%) due to climate change is higher than averages estimated for other South American mammals (e.g., a 37% reduction of habitat in 87% of analyzed species; 
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schloss, Nunez &amp; Lawler, 2012</xref>). In addition to a reduction in range extension of huemul’s possible habitats, we observed latitudinal and altitudinal variation of suitable habitat for this deer. This pattern of alteration in wildlife distribution has been proposed globally, because species are expected to be able to adapt to future environmental changes with regard to latitudinal and altitudinal migrations (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schloss, Nunez &amp; Lawler (2012)</xref> suggested that sources of habitat variations from climate change would affect most mammal species throughout the Americas, due to limitations in their dispersal capacities. An average of 9.2% of mammal species are expected to be unable to adjust to habitat variation, with as many as 39% in some regions of the American continent. In our case, the possibility of huemul migration could be limited due to its low dispersal capacity (8 km; 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill et al., 2008</xref>), its high site fidelity, its low population density, and its frequent population isolation and fragmentation (
