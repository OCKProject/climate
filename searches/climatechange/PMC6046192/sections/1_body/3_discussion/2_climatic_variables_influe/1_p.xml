<p class="p">Among variables used in the models to predict the most suitable habitat areas, those giving the most information for model construction were: seasonality of temperature, annual precipitation, seasonality of precipitation, and precipitation during the coldest quarter. Annual precipitation is positively correlated with above ground net primary production at regional levels (

Here water availability is limited by landscape topography, generating a vegetation gradient from forest, shrub lands, and steppe dry areas (

 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paruelo, Jobb√°gy &amp; Sala, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, seasonality of precipitation would act as a limiting factor for vegetation growth (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hsu, Powell &amp; Adler, 2012</xref>), since variation in water availability affects vegetation, shaping the amount of environmental energy, and limiting available habitats (

 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cramer &amp; Hoffman, 2015</xref>), the winter season does have an important effect on several other organisms (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams, Henry &amp; Sinclair, 2015</xref>), decreasing survivorship in some cases (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brodie et al., 2013</xref>). Seasonality of temperature could indicate that habitats used by huemul can withstand a moderate variation of seasonal temperature, influencing tolerance of vegetation associated with this deer. A similar effect has been observed for African savannah vegetation, where the effect of variation in warm seasons reduced vegetation, producing a reduction in abundance and changes in distribution of ungulate populations inhabiting them (
