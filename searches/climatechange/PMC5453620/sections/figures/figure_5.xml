  <p class="p">(A) Sources, effects, and interactions at the interface of atmospheric and physiological chemistry with feedback loops involving Earth System, climate, life, and health. (B) Interactions of atmospheric and physiological ROS/RNS with antioxidants (ascorbate, uric acid, reduced glutathione, Î±-tocopherol) in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the human respiratory tract. Redox-active components, including reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), soot, quinones and transition metals can induce ROS formation in vivo, leading to oxidative stress and biological aging.
