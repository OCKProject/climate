<p class="p">Several epidemiological studies and meta-analyses reported that respiratory allergies and atopic dermatitis are associated with exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), but different results were obtained for different diseases and locations/studies.

 </sup> TRAP is a complex mixture comprising variable proportions of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants from traffic-related primary emissions, as well as secondary pollutants formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref283" class="xref">283</xref>
 </sup> Among the pollutants from primary emissions (combustion and noncombustion sources) are road dust, tire and break wear, soot/DEP, BC/EC, metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and nitrogen oxides (NO

 </sup> A recent review concluded that epidemiological studies were restricted by imprecise methods of assessing both TRAP exposure and related health effects.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref283" class="xref">283</xref>
 </sup> Accordingly, several studies called for more comprehensive investigations of TRAP markers, personal exposure, and lifetime outcomes.

 </sup> The application of improved measurement and modeling techniques as outlined above should enable refined epidemiological studies and more targeted testing of hypotheses by resolving different types of TRAP (e.g., freshly emitted DEP vs resuspended road dust; soot and polycyclic hydrocarbons vs trace metals; ozone vs nitrogen oxides; etc.).
