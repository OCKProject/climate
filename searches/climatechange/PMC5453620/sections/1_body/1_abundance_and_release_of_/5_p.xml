<p class="p">Besides allergenic proteins, pollen and fungal spores also release other compounds that can act as adjuvants (

  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other" class="xref">1</xref>
 </xref>). In particular, the release of nonallergenic, bioactive, pollen-associated lipid mediators (PALMs) with pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects can trigger and enhance allergies (

 </sup> For example, skin prick tests of pollen allergens elicited larger wheals when tested together with low molecular weight compounds extracted from pollen.

 </sup> The release of these substances can be influenced by climatic conditions and air pollution, and significantly higher levels were found for pollen collected near roads with heavy traffic.

 </sup> Leukotriene-like PALMs (oxylipins) have the potential to attract and activate innate immune cells like neutrophils and eosinophils.

 </sup> Other PALMs such as phytoprostanes (lipophilic counterparts of prostaglandins) are water-soluble and can inhibit the production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) by dendritic cells in the lower respiratory tract, thus favoring an allergenic Th2 T cell response.

 </sup> A recent study showed that the low-molecular-weight fraction of phytoprostane E1 (PPE1) in ragweed pollen extract specifically enhanced IgE production in Th2 primed B cells. It was suggested that pollen-derived nonallergenic substances might be responsible for aggravation of IgE-mediated allergies.
