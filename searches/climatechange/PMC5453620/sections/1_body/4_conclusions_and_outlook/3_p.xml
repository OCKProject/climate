<p class="p">Anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric trace substances are affecting air quality and climate on local, regional, and global scales. Changes in atmospheric aerosol composition, oxidant concentrations, and climate parameters can induce chemical modifications of allergens, increase oxidative stress in the human body, and skew the immune system toward allergic reactions. In particular, air pollutants can act as adjuvants and alter the immunogenicity of allergenic proteins, while climate change affects the abundance and properties of bioaerosols as carriers of aeroallergens. The production, release and properties of allergens and adjuvants are subject to various human interferences with the biosphere and climate system, including air pollutant interactions with natural and agricultural vegetation, fertilization and land-use change, as well as plant breeding and genetic engineering.</p>
