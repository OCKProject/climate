<p class="p">The following key questions remain to be resolved to understand and mitigate potential effects of air pollution and climate change on the observed increase and future development of allergies:
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <label class="label">(Q1)</label>
   <p class="p">Which air pollutant and climate change effects have the largest potential to influence on the abundance and potency of allergens and adjuvants in the human environment (indoor and outdoor)?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <label class="label">(Q2)</label>
   <p class="p">Which elements and reaction pathways of the immune system are particularly susceptible to disturbance by air pollutants, and what are the most relevant chemical and physiological mechanisms (adjuvant activity vs allergen modification)?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <label class="label">(Q3)</label>
   <p class="p">Which environmental and physiological parameters are needed and best suited to account for and assess air pollutant and climate change effects in epidemiological studies of allergic diseases (attribution and prediction of environmental risk factors)?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <label class="label">(Q4)</label>
   <p class="p">How important are air pollutant and climate change effects relative to other environmental, lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic risk factors for allergic diseases?</p>
