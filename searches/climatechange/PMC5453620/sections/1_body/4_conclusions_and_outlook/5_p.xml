 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93" class="xref">93</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref280" class="xref">280</xref>)). Beyond addressing the above questions, it appears worthwhile to explore which components of the immune system could be modulated to prevent adverse effects of air pollution, for example, whether therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against relevant cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) or IgE antibodies could make a difference. Further information about ongoing efforts and future perspectives of mitigating the health effects of climate change and air pollution is available from various national and international government agencies, medical institutions and related organizations (e.g., refs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37" class="xref">37</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref446" class="xref">446</xref>)). For efficient scientific progress, it will be important to combine and optimize state-of-the-art methods and results of environmental, immunological and epidemiological studies, tightly coupling physical, chemical, biological, and medical techniques and knowledge. One of the challenges consists in identifying and quantifying the mechanisms and feedback loops of immunochemical reactions in response to environmental influencing factors, including chemical modifications and interactions of allergens and adjuvants under realistic environmental and physiological conditions. For this purpose, the results of laboratory experiments and monitoring networks with improved detection methods for allergens, adjuvants and reactive intermediates should be used to design and inform epidemiological studies targeting the effects of different types and combinations of air pollutants and climate parameters.
