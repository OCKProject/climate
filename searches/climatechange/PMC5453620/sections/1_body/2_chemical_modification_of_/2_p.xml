<p class="p">Chemical modification by air pollutants can lead to changes in the structure of protein macromolecules (amino acid oxidation, peptide backbone cleavage, conformational changes, cross-linking, and oligomerization), and affect protein stability and other properties, such as hydrophobicity and acidity of binding sites.

 </sup> These and other posttranslational protein modifications may induce multiple effects in the molecular interaction of allergens with the immune system: (1) stability effects influencing the accumulation and degradation of allergenic proteins, the duration of exposure times to cellular receptors, and the process of antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II;

 </sup> (2) epitope effects, that is, generation of new epitopes or modification of existing epitopes, changing the binding properties of antibodies and receptors, by direct chemical modification or as a result of conformational changes; (3) adjuvant effects, that is, generation of new adjuvant functions or modification of existing adjuvant functions such as lipid-binding capacities due to modified ligand binding sites; and (4) agglomeration effects, that is, multiplication or shielding of epitopes or adjuvant functions by cross-linking (oligomerization) of allergenic proteins, which may enhance the cross-linking of effector cell receptors (FcεRI) or sterically hinder molecular and cellular interactions.
