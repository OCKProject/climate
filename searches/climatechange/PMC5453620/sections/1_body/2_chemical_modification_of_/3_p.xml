<p class="p">In the atmosphere, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are generated via photochemistry and gas-phase, heterogeneous, and multiphase reactions involving atmospheric oxidants and aerosol particles. In the human body, ROS/RNS can be formed upon exposure to air pollutants

 </sup> and by regular physiological reactions.

 </sup> For example, ROS/RNS are generated during oxidative metabolism as well as in cellular responses to foreign or danger signals (cytokines, xenobiotics, bacterial invasion).

 </sup> Low amounts of ROS/RNS are involved in intra- and intercellular redox signaling processes, for example, oxidizing low molecular mass thiols and protein thiols (

 </sup> An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of oxidants (e.g., induced by air pollutants) can lead to irreversible damage of cellular lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, eventually resulting in cell death.

 </sup> Rising levels of atmospheric oxidants and air particulate matter may lead to protein modifications in the atmosphere, as well as in the human body because of elevated oxidative stress levels, especially in the epithelial lining fluid (

 </sup> Moreover, air pollutants and climatic stress factors, such as UV radiation, drought, salinity, and temperature extremes, can also induce higher ROS/RNS levels inside plants, which may lead to chemical modification of plant proteins, including allergens.

 </sup> In the course of the Anthropocene, the ambient concentrations of many ROS/RNS have strongly increased because of emissions from traffic and combustion sources, as well as other industrial and agricultural activities like nitrogen fertilization of soils.
