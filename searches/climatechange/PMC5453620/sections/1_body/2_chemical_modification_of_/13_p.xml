 </sup> Protein reactions with ROS/RNS are generally pH-dependent and yield a mixture of hydroxylated, nitrated, cross-linked, aggregated or degraded products.

 </sup> To assess immune responses to specific posttranslational modifications of proteins, it is necessary to carefully characterize the investigated samples and avoid artifacts or misinterpretations that might arise from interferences between different reaction products and pathways, for example, nitration vs dimerization or oligomerization of proteins exposed to oxidizing and nitrating agents (
