<p class="p">Oxidative protein cross-linking can occur upon (a) tyrosyl radical coupling through dityrosine cross-links, (b) Schiff-base coupling of oxidation-derived protein carbonyl groups with the ε-amino groups of lysine residues, and (c) intermolecular disulfide coupling.

 </sup> Recently, protein cross-linking and oligomerization upon exposure to atmospherically relevant concentrations of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> have been shown to proceed via the formation dityrosine cross-links as outlined in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>
 </xref>, yielding up to ∼10% of dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers of a model protein within minutes to hours of exposure under summer smog conditions.

 </sup> Similar reaction mechanisms involving reactive oxygen intermediates may also be responsible for the protein cross-linking observed upon reaction with physiological and synthetic nitrating agents like ONOO

 </sup> Cross-linking upon reaction with tetranitromethane was suggested to alter the immunogenicity and enhance the allergenicity of Bet v 1 through decreased endolysosomal degradation leading to extended MHC class II antigen presentation.

 </sup> On the other hand, oligomerization of allergens induced by modification with glutaraldehyde, that is, formation of glutaraldehyde bridges between nucleophilic amino acid residues (in particular lysine), was suggested to reduce immunogenicity and allergenicity due to delayed allergen uptake and presentation by dendritic cells.
