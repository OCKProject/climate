<p class="p">Recent studies yielded chemical exposure-response relations between ambient concentrations of air pollutants and the production rates and concentrations of ROS in the ELF of the human respiratory tract.

 </xref>, the total concentration of ROS generated by redox-active substances contained in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) deposited in the ELF ranges from ∼10 nmol L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> under clean conditions up to almost ∼250 nmol L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> under highly polluted conditions. Thus, the inhalation of PM2.5 can increase ROS concentrations in the ELF to levels that exceed physiological background levels (50–200 nmol L
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and are characteristic for respiratory diseases.

 </sup> In addition to the effects of PM2.5, ambient ozone readily saturates the ELF and can enhance oxidative stress by depleting antioxidants and surfactants.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref309" class="xref">309</xref>
 </sup> Ozone also reacts with skin lipids (e.g., squalene) and generates organic compounds (e.g., mono- and dicarbonyls) that can act as irritants.

 </sup> These and related organic compounds were found to act as adjuvants in the development of respiratory allergies as well as atopic dermatitis.

 </sup> Some air pollutants and chemical reaction products formed at epithelial interfaces are sufficiently long-lived and mobile to diffuse through membranes and interact with the neural, cardiovascular, and immune system networks of the human body.

 </sup> Through these and related physiological interactions involving DAMPs, inflammatory mediators, cytokines, leukocytes etc., oxidative stress and inflammation caused by air pollutants may propagate from the respiratory tract and skin to other parts of the human organism and exert systemic influence on the development of allergies, reaching also the gastrointestinal tract.
