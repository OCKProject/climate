<p class="p">Allergies are hypersensitivities initiated by specific immunologic mechanisms (abnormal adaptive immune responses).

 </sup> While some of the perceived rise in allergies may be due to improved diagnosis, the prevalence of allergic diseases has genuinely increased with industrialization and with the adoption of a “Western” lifestyle.

 </sup> The development of allergies is a complex multifactorial process that involves various factors influencing the body’s predisposition and immune response, and the manifestation of allergic diseases depends on exposure to allergens, adjuvants and other environmental and lifestyle factors (

 </sup> Among the risk factors for allergic diseases are the genetic predisposition of the individual (referred to as atopy), reduced childhood exposure to pathogens and parasites (“hygiene hypothesis”), diet/nutrition, psychological/social stress, and environmental pollution, including outdoor and indoor air pollutants (ozone, nitrogen oxides, diesel exhaust particles, tobacco smoke, etc.).

 </sup> As outlined in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>
 </xref>, climate change and air pollution can influence the bioavailability and potency of allergens and adjuvants in multiple ways, including changes in vegetation cover, pollination and sporulation periods, and chemical modifications. Moreover, climatic conditions and air pollutants may skew physiological processes and the immune system toward the development of allergies, for example, by oxidative stress and inflammation, disruption of protective epithelial barriers, and disturbance of related microbial communities (microbiomes).
