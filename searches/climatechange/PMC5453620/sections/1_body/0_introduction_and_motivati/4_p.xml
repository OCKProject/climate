 </sup> In view of these findings, it appears unlikely that the strong environmental changes of the Anthropocene would have no effect on the interaction of the human immune system with environmental stimuli, including allergens and adjuvants. Indeed, it seems necessary to address the question whether human activities are creating a hazardous atmosphere that may severely affect public health.

 </sup> As detailed in the following sections, both air pollutants and climate parameters can influence the environmental abundance of allergenic bioparticles and the release of allergenic proteins and biogenic adjuvants. Moreover, air pollutants can chemically modify and agglomerate allergenic proteins, and they can act as adjuvants inducing epithelial damage and inflammation.
