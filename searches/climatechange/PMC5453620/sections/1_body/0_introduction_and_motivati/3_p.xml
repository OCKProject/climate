 </sup> Human activities have become a driving force that changes many characteristics of our environment such as biodiversity and air quality on local, regional, and global scales, for example, through land use change, agriculture, fossil fuel burning, traffic emissions, and the release of industrial products.

 </sup> Since the industrialization of the 19th century and especially during the “Great Acceleration” of the 20th century, the primary emission, secondary formation, and concentration of air pollutants like ozone, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides, soot, and a wide range of other reactive trace gases and aerosols have greatly increased relative to preindustrial times, especially in densely populated and industrialized areas but also in agricultural environments and around the globe.

 </sup> For example, the average mixing ratios of ozone in continental background air have increased by factors of 2–4 from around 10–20 ppb from the beginning of the 19th century to 30–40 ppb in the 21st century, and the number and mass concentrations of aerosol particles in polluted urban air are typically by 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than in pristine air of remote continental regions (∼10
