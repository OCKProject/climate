<p class="p">Other studies have also assessed the influence of climate change on the incidence of different infectious diseases adopting different methods. Consistent with previous studies, empirical data analysis also showed that one or more climate variables could lead to more disease cases in some places [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. For example, temperature was significantly correlated with the incidence of HFM [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Precipitation change has been shown different effects on sensitivity of dysentery [

 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], such as the effect of relative humidity on dysentery [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], HFM [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], malaria [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and so on. Relative humidity measures the ratio of water vapor content in the air to the saturating level, which varies with temperature. By contrast, absolute humidity measures the ratio of actual amount of water present in the air, without considering the temperature [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Shaman found that absolute humidity constrains both transmission efficiency and virus survival much more significantly than relative humidity in influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Besides the emerging hypothesis that absolute humidity is an important determinant of observed influenza outcomes [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], this study provides novel ecologic evidence that absolute humidity has also a critical influence on many observed infectious diseases in Anhui Province, including dysentery, HFM, hepatitis A, hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, malaria, meningitis and schistosomiasis.
