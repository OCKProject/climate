<p class="p">We also collected monthly data concerning climate variables for each county at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The dataset was generated based on field observation, remotely sensed data and reanalysis data from the Land Surface Model over the Chinese mainland (which dates from 1960 to 2010) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In the study, three climate variables for the study periods were considered; monthly average temperature (MAT), monthly accumulated precipitation (MAP), and monthly average absolute humidity (MAAH). Moreover, county-level historical mean values (

 <italic class="italic">HC
  <sub class="sub">i</sub>
  <sup class="sup">std</sup>
 </italic>) of the three climate variables from 1973 to 2003 (30 years) were also calculated for identifying the exposure and non-exposure groups. Considering the statistical requirements of the linear regression method and the hypothesis test, only counties with at least 20 months of data concerning infectious disease, of which more than 5 and 7 months are in exposure and non-exposure groups, respectively, were regarded as the effective counties to be analyzed. The calculations were carried out using MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a).
