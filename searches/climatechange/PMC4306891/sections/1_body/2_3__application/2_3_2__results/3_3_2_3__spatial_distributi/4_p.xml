<p class="p">As for dysentery, the thirty five counties where disease outbreak was sensitive to the temperature change were mainly located along a band distribution from the northwest to southeast. The counties with significantly different association between dysentery incidence and precipitation in the exposure and non-exposure groups were mainly located along the Huai River and Yangtze River. For most parts of Anhui Province, except some southwestern counties, dysentery incidence was sensitive to the change of absolute humidity. Moreover, the relative sensitivity to absolute humidity in thirteen urban cities was smaller than that in the surrounding rural counties. That is to say, rural areas may be the key areas that need more inputs in response to climate change due to the relatively underdeveloped medical conditions. </p>
