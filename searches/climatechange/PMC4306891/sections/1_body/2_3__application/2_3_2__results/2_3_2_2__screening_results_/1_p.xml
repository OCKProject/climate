<p class="p">Among the above thirteen infectious diseases, nine (dysentery, HFM, hepatitis A, hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, malaria, meningitis, influenza, and schistosomiasis) were examined to investigate whether they would be affected by changes in the selected climatic variables based on the Relative Sensitivity indicator. The remaining four infectious diseases (Japanese encephalitis, avian influenza, leptospirosis and cholera) were excluded from the analysis due to their lower incidences during the 2004–2010 time period. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-00767-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the Relative Sensitivity (RS) of the nine infectious diseases to changes in climate variables, as exposure factors in Anhui Province. Relative Sensitivity values where
