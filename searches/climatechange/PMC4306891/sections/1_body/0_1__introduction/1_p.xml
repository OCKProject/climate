<p class="p">According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) fifth report, the Earth system is experiencing an unequivocal warming, and will likely become dangerously warmer during this century [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In addition to climate change’s impacts on the physical Earth system, climate change also substantially affects human health, especially where infectious diseases are involved [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. There are three essential components for most infectious diseases: an agent (or pathogen), a host (or vector) and a transmission environment [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For most climate-sensitive infectious diseases, climate change may impact the whole process of a disease’s development [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], including the survival, reproduction, or distribution of disease pathogens and their hosts, as well as the availability and means of such pathogens’ transmission environments. For example, temperature increases impact the spread of malaria; Leeson [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] revealed the influence of increasing temperature on the pathogen, while Beck-Johnson

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] described the relationship between temperature and the population dynamics of the host (

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, previous studies have mainly concentrated on identifying the impacts of climate change on some component of the development of infectious diseases. The sensitivity of infectious diseases to climate change remains unclear because of the complex interactions between climate variables and the three key components of infectious disease development. As a result, quantitative screening (from a systematic perspective) for the infectious diseases that are sensitive to climate change is still a challenge without adequate research.
