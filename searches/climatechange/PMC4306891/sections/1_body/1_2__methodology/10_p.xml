<p class="p">As mentioned in the Introduction, climate change impacts all components in a disease’s development. The impacts may vary among different diseases and different stages in a disease’s development since they have different epidemiology. Temperature may play a crucial role in the development of some diseases, while other diseases are mainly affected by precipitation, wind or some other climate variables. Hence, it is difficult to investigate all these specific impacts (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, impacts for different diseases, and for different stages in a disease’s development) using the same method. However, the objectives of this study are to investigate the general impacts of climate change on different diseases instead of specific impacts on different diseases, and then to find out the dominant climate variables, if any, for different diseases. In the interest of these objectives, it is reasonable to use the same univariate statistical methods to examine the general impacts of climate change on infectious diseases.
