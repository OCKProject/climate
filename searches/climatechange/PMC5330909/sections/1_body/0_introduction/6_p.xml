<p class="p">Among the many applications, species distribution models have been used to determine environmental relationships and potential impacts of climate change (Elith, Kearney, &amp; Phillips,

 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Our objective was to model current and future distributions of several 
 <italic class="italic">en route</italic> migratory shorebirds and wintering waterfowl relative to land‚Äêuse patterns, the spatial distribution and composition of wetlands, and data from a wide range of global climate models. In general, our models estimated contemporary probabilities of occurrence and responses to climate change. We assumed that bird encounters can indicate the presence of suitable habitat and, therefore, predicted probabilities of occurrence could inform future conservation efforts.
