<p class="p">Protecting species that require resources across expansive, spatially heterogeneous, and temporally dynamic regions necessitates an advanced understanding of full life cycle ecology (Small‐Lorenz, Culp, Ryder, Will, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Many shorebirds and waterfowl depend on finding ample wintering, migratory, and breeding habitats, and knowing the circumstances under which particular habitat locations are selected could inform land protection, mitigation, and conservation efforts. Migration is inherently risky, in part because of challenges posed by the natural spatial and temporal variations in the condition of wetland habitats. Impending climate change may alter inundation patterns and the function of critical wetland habitats via, for example, increased evapotranspiration associated with higher temperatures (Johnson, Werner, &amp; Guntenspergen,

 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, humans continue to alter the landscape, including the conversion of land to uses that produce food and fuel (Hurlbert &amp; Liang, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Thomas, Lanctot, &amp; Székely, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The combined effects of changing climatic conditions and additional habitat loss could pose a substantial future threat to the persistence of waterfowl and migratory shorebirds.
