<p class="p">Our findings suggest that when aggregated across our entire study area and across a 30‐year time period, the condition of migration stopover sites for shorebirds that can shift in space and time may be marginally improved by changing climate. Exceptions to this generalization are the two upland species, Mountain Plover and Long‐billed Curlew, which may experience slight declines in their probabilities of occurrence. Spatial shifts within the region are expected to some degree for many of the species, however, implicating the need for adequate habitats and resources to be maintained or made available in the future target areas. Our 30‐year projections do not address the inter‐annual variability that currently exists and will likely persist into the future. As a result, shorebird populations may need to shift spatially on a year‐to‐year basis. If populations are unable to shift in space, either because of intrinsic factors (e.g., lack of plasticity in choosing routes) or extrinsic factors (lack of suitable habitat in climatically favorable areas), populations within the study area during spring migration may be negatively impacted by changing climate.</p>
