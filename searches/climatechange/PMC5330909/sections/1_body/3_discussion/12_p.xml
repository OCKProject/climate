<p class="p">Through the aggregation of newly emerging spatial tools, managers can address societal needs while basing ultimate decisions on sound science and landscape ecology foundations. The findings of our study have applicability to ongoing research and management efforts within the Great Plains Landscape Conservation Cooperative boundary. An advantage to conducting our analyses regionally, rather than from national or hemispheric perspectives, is that findings are sufficiently fine‐tuned to incorporate into land management and acquisition decisions. The findings allow our partners, the Rainwater Basin Joint Venture (RWBJV) and PLJV, to evaluate their current habitat priorities and delivery actions for nonbreeding shorebirds and waterfowl and to identify new landscapes to target for current or future conservation action, thereby enhancing the adaptive capacity of target species in the face of climate change (Stein et al.,

In addition, because there is substantial uncertainty regarding future climate projections, the application of risk diversification tools such as Modern Portfolio Theory to conservation planning may serve to optimize spatial targeting of conservation actions (Ando &amp; Mallory,
