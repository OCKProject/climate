<p class="p">Here, we deliberately specify weather, rather than climate, as it has proven to be a better predictor of vagile species (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">en route</italic> migrants, nomads) and is needed for modeling yearly variations. Predictions based on climate can overestimate the “availability of suitable habitat and species climatic tolerances, masking species potential vulnerability to climate change” (Reside, VanDerWal, Kutt, &amp; Perkins, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Our empirical models based on historic weather and bird survey data captured the tight correspondence of bird occurrence and weather because of the small time frame (1 month) within which we associated birds with locations and weather variables.
