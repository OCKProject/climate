<p class="p">Recent evidence reveals that long‐distance migrating terrestrial birds have a greater capacity than short‐distance migrants to adjust

 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This is in part because long‐distance migrants presumably experience the selective pressure imposed by greater degrees of environmental variation. Consistent with this viewpoint, predicted increases in probabilities of occurrence of shorebirds in this study were positively related to migration distance (
