<p class="p">Distribution models are possibly the best available tool for predicting responses to changes in habitat and environmental conditions (but see Sinclair, White, &amp; Newell, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). To our knowledge, modeling probabilities of occurrence across a season of active migration with empirical data is a relatively unique approach; others have modeled migration directly using mechanistic models (e.g., Lonsdorf et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Projections using the most current climate model data indicate that the probabilities of occurrence of shorebirds and waterfowl in our region of the Great Plains would remain largely unchanged, but that migration could occur earlier (supporting numerous studies) and that suitable climate would shift predominantly westward, supporting Currie and Venne (

Additionally, that the modeled species seem mostly adaptable to current climate projections (at least until 2060), suggests that others factors might pose larger threats, for example, land‐use change (see Titeux, Henle, Mihoub, &amp; Brotons,
