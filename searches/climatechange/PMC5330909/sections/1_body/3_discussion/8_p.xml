<p class="p">There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the factors used as signals for speed of migration (Marra et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Empirical models of habitat used during active migration appear to be a rare (but see Gowan &amp; Ortega‐Ortiz, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and potentially difficult endeavor (Joseph &amp; Stockwell, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Not surprisingly, there has been considerably more modeling work completed on the relatively static periods of the annual cycle, that is, breeding and wintering habitat, as well as on the dates of first encounter at some geographic location, often based on data availability (e.g., Chambers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Murphy‐Klassen, Underwood, Sealy, &amp; Czyrnyj,
