<p class="p">Shorebirds with more westerly or northerly distributions exhibited the largest predicted declines in probability of occurrence with an average change of −0.003 (Tables

 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>). Mountain Plover occurrences were predicted to decline in April and in mid‐late May in the southern and western portions of the GPLCC, respectively, particularly in their stronghold in eastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico (Appendix S4), with an average decline in probability of occurrence of −0.015. The largest probabilities for Willets occurred early in migration, and declines were predicted in northern Nebraska. In contrast, the largest probabilities of occurrence for Long‐billed Curlews existed in the northern half of Nebraska although small pockets of declines were predicted there (Appendix S4); their overall predicted decline in probability of occurrence was −0.005.
