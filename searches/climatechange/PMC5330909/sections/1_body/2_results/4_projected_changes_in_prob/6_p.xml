<p class="p">Shorebirds with a more easterly distribution, mostly long‐distance migrants, had an average increase in probability of occurrence of 0.030 across the region during spring migration. The four species in this group, Stilt, Baird's, White‐rumped, and Semipalmated Sandpipers, were predicted to increase in occurrence to varying degrees during April and mid‐May in western Nebraska and eastern Colorado where they currently have low occurrence rates. Using the hotter/drier climate model, ACCESS1‐0, probabilities of occurrence for this group declined in central Kansas, an area with relatively large occurrence probabilities.</p>
