<p class="p">Overall, changes in probabilities of occurrence differed among GCMs and among species relative to their spatial distribution across the region. Averaged across all locations, species, and models, probabilities of occurrence increased by 0.011–0.023, with the largest increase early in migration (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>). Included in (and concealed by) these averages were overall decreases for Mountain Plovers (−0.015) and Long‐billed Curlews (−0.005), and decreases for Marbled Godwits, Willets, and Wilson's Phalaropes during specific time periods (late April to mid‐May; Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>). Models predicted additional declines for some species in early migration (Appendix S3); changes ranged from −0.042 to 0.094.
