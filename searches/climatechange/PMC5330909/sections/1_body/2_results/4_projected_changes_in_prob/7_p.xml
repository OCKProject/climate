<p class="p">The two groups distributed more evenly across the study area were intermediate in response, with average predicted increases in occurrence of 0.009 and 0.022 for western and eastern species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>), respectively. Of these, the more eastern species, Lesser Yellowlegs, Least Sandpipers, and Long‐billed Dowitchers, exhibited the same patterns as the more eastern group described above, with potential increases in occurrence in the northwestern part of the region and potential declines in central Kansas if conditions become hotter and drier.
