<p class="p">Predicted change varies among the GCMs, as portrayed for two species, the Lesser Yellowlegs and Baird's Sandpiper, and two GCMs, the relatively warm/wet IPSL‐CM5B‐LR and hot/dry ACCESS1‐0 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Overall, probabilities of occurrence for the Lesser Yellowlegs and Baird's Sandpiper increased by 0.013 and 0.029, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>), yet there were areas with predicted declines as large as −0.37 and increases of 0.49 (Figure
