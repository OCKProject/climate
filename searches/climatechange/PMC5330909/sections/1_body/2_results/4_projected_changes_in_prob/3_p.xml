<p class="p">Potential shifts in spatial distribution are more apparent in maps portraying the actual changes in probabilities in occurrence. Maps portraying predicted changes in the probabilities of occurrence, for both the average of the five GCMs (ensemble) and the hottest and driest model, ACCESS1‐0, are provided in Appendix S4 for all species. Interpretation of the predicted changes is best made in conjunction with the contemporary distributions, so that changes can be related to the probabilities of occurrence in particular areas. For example, early in migration, increases are projected for the Lesser Yellowlegs in areas of Kansas and Oklahoma where the contemporary probabilities of occurrence were relatively small (Appendix S4d). In contrast, during the middle of migration, decreases in occurrence were projected in prime habitat in northern Kansas (ensemble) and throughout Kansas (ACCESS1‐0, hot/dry).</p>
