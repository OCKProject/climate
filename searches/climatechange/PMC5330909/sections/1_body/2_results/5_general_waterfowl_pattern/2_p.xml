<p class="p">Wintering waterfowl are distributed throughout the GPLCC region during December and January with average probabilities of occurrence of 0.356 and 0.367 for Mallard and Northern Pintail, respectively. Northern Pintail were concentrated in the Texas panhandle (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Averaged across the five GCMs, Mallards are predicted to shift northward, with increased probabilities of occurrence in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado and declines in Texas. Increases in occurrence probabilities of Northern Pintails were predicted throughout the region with the exception of an area of decline along the southern GPLCC boundary (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Across the region, the probabilities of occurrence of Mallards and Northern Pintail are expected to increase by 0.046 and 0.061, respectively. All five of the climate models project region‐wide increases in probability of occurrence (Table
