<p class="p">The average probabilities of occurrence (ensembles of the five GCMs) in the contemporary (hindcast; 1981–2010) and future (forecast; 2041–2070) projections were largest for Wilson's Phalarope, Lesser Yellowlegs, and Long‐billed Dowitcher (≥0.46) and lowest for Whimbrel, Marbled Godwit, and American Avocet (≤0.22; Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>) during peak migration. Northbound flights of several early migrants, including Baird's Sandpiper, Lesser Yellowlegs, Least Sandpiper and others, began before April, and migration flights continued through the end of May and beyond for later migrants such as White‐rumped Sandpiper and Wilson's Phalarope (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). Long‐distance migrants such as Stilt Sandpipers and White‐rumped Sandpipers were most likely to occur in the region in mid‐May. Two species that breed in the region, the American Avocet and Long‐billed Curlew, spent the most time in the GPLCC, beginning migration before April and remaining in the area at least through the end of our migration window.
