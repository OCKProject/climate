<p class="p">The five GCMs resulted in small differences in future probabilities of occurrence, as illustrated with predictions for the Long‐billed Dowitcher in the middle of migration (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Probabilities of occurrence were slightly larger with the two hottest GCMs, GFDL‐CM3 and ACCESS1‐0, in mid‐April than the remaining models, and slightly smaller with the driest model, INM‐CM4, than all other models. Probabilities of occurrence for all GCMs and species are presented in Appendix S2.
