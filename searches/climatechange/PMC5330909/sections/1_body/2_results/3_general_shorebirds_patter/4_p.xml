<p class="p">Probability of occurrence patterns differed among the species, with short‐distance migrants Mountain Plovers, Willets, and Long‐billed Curlews occurring primarily in the western and northern portions of the study area, and several short‐to‐intermediate distance species occurring throughout (American Avocet, Whimbrel, Marbled Godwit, and Wilson's Phalarope; Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">5</xref>, Appendix S1). The Lesser Yellowlegs, Least Sandpiper, and Long‐billed Dowitcher occurred throughout, but with marginally larger probabilities of occurrence in the eastern portion of the GPLCC; the remaining four calidridines, including three long‐distance species, occurred primarily in eastern regions, that is, BCR 19 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">5</xref>, Appendix S1). Northward movement patterns across the spring migration window are apparent in the probabilities of occurrence of many of the species, notably Lesser Yellowlegs, Baird's Sandpiper, Least Sandpiper, and Long‐billed Dowitcher (Appendix S1).
