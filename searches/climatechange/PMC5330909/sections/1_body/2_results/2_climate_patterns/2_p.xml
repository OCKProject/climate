<p class="p">Across the GPLCC region, there is a north–south gradient in average annual temperature ranging from 5°C to 19°C and a west–east gradient in annual precipitation ranging from 29 to 102 cm year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Throughout the past several decades, average annual minimum and maximum temperatures have been rising across the region, and rainfall has varied substantially year‐to‐year. Relative to a 1951–1980 baseline period, the five GCMs estimated future climates (2041–2070) ranging from 16% drier to 20% wetter; averaged across the GCMs, rainfall increased by 2% (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The five GCMs predicted varying future precipitation patterns in spring with the wetter GFDL‐CM3 model predicting the greatest increases in the northeastern portion of the region and the other models predicting drier conditions throughout most of the southern portions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The changes predicted in spring temperature varied both spatially and across the GCMs (ranging from 2.5°C to 4.0°C) and with GFDL‐CM3 predicting the highest temperatures, particularly in the western and southern portions of the region (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32755-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). An ensemble of the five GCMs revealed changes in precipitation throughout the region varying from −11 to +65 mm and changes in temperature from 2.2°C to 2.7°C (Figure
