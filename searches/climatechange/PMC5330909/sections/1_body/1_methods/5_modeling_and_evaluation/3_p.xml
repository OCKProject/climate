<p class="p">We modeled probabilities of occurrence using Random Forests, a nonparametric method that combines the predictions from numerous trees. A tree is constructed from a bootstrap subsample of the observations and, for each branch on the tree, the data are split by selecting from a randomized subset of the predictor variables; this step minimizes modeling issues resulting from correlated variables (Breiman,

 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). We were more interested in spatial predictions than inferences about the predictor variables, so reduction of correlation issues was a desirable property (see Dunn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Selected variables are used to hierarchically partition the data into increasing homogenous groups; thus, Random Forests inherently model variable interactions. We equalized the number of presences and absences at 80% of the number of presences for each species, specified that four randomly selected variables would be available for each branch, and built 4,500 trees for each forest.
