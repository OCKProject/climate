<p class="p">We evaluated model performance with the out‐of‐bag observations, that is, observations not selected for a bootstrap sample, a standard Random Forests evaluation procedure. The class (presence or absence) of an out‐of‐bag observation is predicted using a majority vote across all of the trees where it was an out‐of‐bag observation. The reported out‐of‐bag error rate is the average across all observations. Given our binary response variable, probabilities of occurrence are the proportion of trees that classified the site as a presence. For the ecoregional‐level evaluations of probability of occurrence gain or loss, we used averages across the GPLCC.</p>
