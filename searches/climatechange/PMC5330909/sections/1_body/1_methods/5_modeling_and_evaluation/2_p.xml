<p class="p">In response to the science needs of the GPLCC and the PLJV, we modeled nonbreeding distributions of two common waterfowl species and 14 shorebird species representing three families (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Collectively, these species range from short‐ to long‐distance migrants that use a broad range of habitat types, including arid grasslands, unvegetated mudflats, and shallow‐to‐deep water wetlands. At each observation location, we extracted a complete set of the empirical predictive variables from which we built models (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). We also extracted variables across a 30 × 30 m lattice of points, including instead the GCM data, to which we projected the models.
