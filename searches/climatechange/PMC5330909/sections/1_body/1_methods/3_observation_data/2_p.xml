<p class="p">We downloaded observation data from the eBird citizen‐science database (Sullivan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) for the states intersected by the GPLCC boundary for 2002–2010, years that coincide with the beginning of the eBird program and the most recent year in the empirical climate data that we used, respectively. We clipped data to the GPLCC boundary and applied several filters including one based on the scale at which shorebirds optimally respond to habitat patterns, that is, 1.25–2 km (Albanese et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>. We maximized the number of observations available by applying the 2‐km threshold at several steps (see Fink et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Sohl, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We used all incidental observations, that is, from surveys with neither spatial nor temporal measures, and stationary counts, that is, from surveys with a known duration and across an area &lt;30 m in diameter. For traveling and area counts, from surveys across known distances and areas, respectively, which also report to single point locations, we assumed a positive relationship between survey size and habitat heterogeneity and therefore only included traveling counts ≤4.023 km and area counts ≤1,257 ha (2‐km circular radius).
