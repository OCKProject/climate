<p class="p">An important component of eBird data is a field for birders to specify whether or not all species were recorded, information useful to the assumption of absences. We eliminated absences from incidental surveys, considering them less reliable than those from the other survey types. As with the presences, we also eliminated those from traveling counts &gt;4.023 km and those from area counts &gt;1,257 ha. Additionally, we eliminated duplicate absences, that is, surveys on the same date and at the same location as another absence or presence.</p>
