<p class="p">We added data from two surveys conducted between mid‐March and mid‐May in 2008, accounting for approximately 5% of the observations used to build models. One survey included roadsides within a random selection of townships first stratified on wetland and cropland areas. Roadsides were surveyed twice, and all shorebirds within 400 m were recorded. Surveys of 25 sites with known shorebird usage were also included. On the ground, these data were collected similar to those classified as stationary counts in eBird; data from all sources, eBird and supplemental, were converted to presence and absence categories.</p>
