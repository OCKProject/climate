<p class="p">We mapped observation locations by date, compared them to frequency histograms (Skagen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), and selected March 1 to June 15 as the range for spring migration. The largest number of migrants occurs toward the middle of a season (Dunn, Hussell, &amp; Adams, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). To reduce sampling effects, we sorted data for each species by the survey date and clipped the smallest number of records that removed ≥5% from each tail, that is, the earliest and latest encounters within the spring migration window (see Farmer, Hussell, &amp; Mizrahi, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
