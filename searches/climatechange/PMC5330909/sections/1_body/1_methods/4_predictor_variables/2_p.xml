<p class="p">Migration is an interaction between space and time; therefore, we modeled spring stopover locations in the GPLCC with variables of each type, including latitude and day‐of‐year, that is, 1–365; 60–166 thus represents spring migration, March 1 to June 15 (see Gowan &amp; Ortega‐Ortiz, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Higher‐order date variables have been important predictors elsewhere (see Dunn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Farmer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), so we also included the square of the day‐of‐year term. Geographic coordinate variables can account for small‐scale processes and address issues with spatial autocorrelation (Bailey &amp; Gatrell,
