<p class="p">When comparing contemporary to future predictions, one should first project the model to contemporary GCM data (hindcast) because differences between the empirical and GCM data would otherwise contribute to the predicted changes in the probabilities of occurrence (Sofaer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We therefore projected models using GCM data averaged over 1981–2010 and 2041–2070, temporal ranges large enough to minimize the effects of natural variability. Specifically, we used the average annual total precipitation of each temporal range and the 30‐year averages for the appropriate month.
