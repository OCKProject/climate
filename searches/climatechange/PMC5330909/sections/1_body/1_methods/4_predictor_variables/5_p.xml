<p class="p">We created wetland variables from unique features, that is, nonoverlapping, with data from the Playa Lakes Joint Venture (PLJV) and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Shallow depressions that formed as a result of dissolution or wind deflation, playas occur throughout the Great Plains, fill intermittently, and occasionally provide crucial stopover and wintering sites for migratory birds (Haukos et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The PLJV probable playas layer (version 4; PP4) includes some abrupt, artificial boundaries; therefore, we supplemented PP4 with unique playas separately provided by PLJV for Reagan and Upton counties, Texas (323 features), and with possible playas in Wyoming that we derived from NWI data (861 features). We removed seven playas intersecting perennial streams in the medium‐resolution National Hydrologic Dataset, for 90,305 total playas. We also created a Lake variable from NWI, a River variable by combining NWI riparian areas with PLJV riverine features, and a Palustrine variable by combining NWI ponds with PLJV uncategorized features. Duplicate features were removed from one of the variables, first from the PLJV supplemental layer and next from NWI, that is, PLJV playas were fully retained. In species distribution modeling, variables representing composition are more predictive than those representing distance (Johnson &amp; Higgins, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Separating feature types into different variables allowed wetland dynamics to vary, for example, across weather patterns. In order to minimize conversion error and utilize functions in ArcGIS (10.2), we converted wetland vectors to 10‐m‐resolution rasters, which resulted in &lt;1% change in area, and computed the proportions of each variable within circular moving windows (2‐km radius).
