<p class="p">Among many possible effects, climate change could alter the connectivity of wetlands across the Great Plains (McIntyre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). General circulation models (GCMs), which forecast future climatic conditions, can be the largest source of uncertainty when predicting future species distributions; thus, a complementary subset of GCMs should be used (Stralberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We selected five GCMs from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) based on an increase of 8.5 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (RCP 8.5). We selected GCMs that represent a large range of the variation between the models using a scatter plot of the means of precipitation change and temperature change across the GPLCC (Talbert, personal communication; North Central Climate Science Center), including one near the average of all the GCMs and one from each of the quadrants relative to that point, for example, one hotter and drier GCM. The GCMs, and average forecasts relative to the central CMCC‐CM, were ACCESS1‐0 (hotter/drier), GFDL‐CM3 (hotter/wetter), INM‐CM4 (warmer/drier), and IPSL‐CM5B‐LR (warmer/wetter) (Table
