<p class="p">We time‐matched observations to five month‐long weather variables including total precipitation and averages of the daily wind speed and minimum, maximum, and average temperature (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32755-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). We matched observations that occurred in the first 15 days of a month to weather data from the previous month and remaining observations to the matching month. We also matched each record to the precipitation total from the previous calendar year, for example, all 2010 records, regardless of month, were matched to the total precipitation in 2009 for that location (see Johnson, Rice, Haukos, &amp; Thorpe, 
 <xref rid="ece32755-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition to phenological effects, weather variables can predict available wetland habitat because availability can vary as a function of precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed (Albanese et al.,
