<p id="Par32" class="p">Most recently, Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>] quantified premature morality related to O

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> long-term exposure, using ensemble-mean results from 14 ACCMIP models for the four RCPs for combined emissions and climate scenarios, additionally considering future population projections. Global excess O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related (316,000 deaths/year in 2100) were found under the RCP8.5 but avoided O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related respiratory mortalities (−718,000 to −1.02 million deaths/year) resulted from the other three RCP scenarios respectively, in line with their respective changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations as described above. For RCP8.5, climate change was found to contribute 14% of the overall increase in global ozone mortality estimated in 2100 relative to 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. Equivalent values for Europe were +2,390 (RCP 8.5) to −24,900 to −44,600 (other three RCP scenarios) annual avoided deaths in 2100. However, when the change in population between 2000 and 2100 was also considered, the global mortality burden of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increased from 382,000 deaths/yr. in 2000 to 1.1–2.4 million deaths/yr. in 2100 depending on RCP scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Reduced global PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations in all RCP scenarios led to global avoided premature mortalities ranging between −2.4 to −1.3 million deaths/yr. (for Europe: −103,000 to - 112,000 avoided premature mortalities in 2100) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Under RCP 8.5, climate change countered the decrease in global PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>-related mortality by 16% in 2100 relative to 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. Considering future PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations and population change, the global mortality burden of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> decreased from 1.7 million deaths/yr. in 2000 to 0.95–1.55 million deaths/yr. in 2100 depending on RCP scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Differences in simulated pollutant concentrations were highlighted as the major source of overall mortality uncertainty [
