<p id="Par30" class="p">The combined effects of emission and climate changes under the RCP scenarios averaged over Europe based on IPCC AR5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>] are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. By 2100, European multi-model annual-mean surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> changes between −15 to +2 ppbv relative to 2000 and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> changes between −4 to −6 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>. The increase in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> under RCP 8.5 reflects primarily the increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>], whilst the decreases in the other three scenarios reflect the role of emission reductions of other O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursors. PM changes depend on oxidant levels but generally follow SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and primary organic carbon emissions reductions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. All RCP scenarios suggest similar decreases in European-average PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. Overall, the emissions changes strongly drive changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> in terms of annual-mean metrics. These are either augmented or reduced by the multiple effects of climate on atmospheric composition. However, as discussed above, for other metrics relating to peak exposure levels, the effects of changes in climate may be relatively more important.
