<p id="Par31" class="p">Collette et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>] examined the effects of the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios alongside compatible (but not RCP) emission scenarios on air quality in 2050 for both O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. For both pollutants, they showed that the main factor driving future air quality projections for Europe was precursor emission changes, rather than climate change. A clear O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> climate penalty was found across most of Europe. The resulting change in population-weighted SOMO35 O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> health metric (defined as the annual sum of daily maximum 8 h running mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> over 35 ppbv) varied between +7% to −80% depending on the emission scenario whilst exposure-weighted PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> was reduced by 62–78%. However, the authors point out the sensitivity to the emission scenarios used and to precipitation projections. Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>] further note the potential of climate-related increases in natural NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions from lightning and soils to offset anthropogenic NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emission changes. Over the UK, greater O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> penalties from emissions changes compared to temperature change were also reported [
