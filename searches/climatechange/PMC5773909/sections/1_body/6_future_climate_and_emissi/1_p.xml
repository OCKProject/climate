<p id="Par28" class="p">The attribution of future climate change on air quality can be difficult for several reasons: results are strongly influenced by the driving global climate model, simulations need to be of sufficient duration to separate climate change from climate variability, and the impacts of climate change on air pollution are likely to depend on the magnitudes of anthropogenic emission change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. The majority of recent studies that consider both air-quality impacts from climate change as well as consequent health effects under the RCP scenarios typically consider combined emission and climate change, which are reviewed below. For the RCP scenarios, changes in global-mean temperature associated with changes in greenhouse gas emissions have been given in the previous section. All RCP scenarios assume strong abatement measures: NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions are reduced by ~50% in 2100 (from ~80 Tg NO yr.
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 30–50 Tg NO yr.
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) compared to 2000 levels and black carbon (BC) emission also reduce by a similar percentage (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]). These measures generally result in large decreases in pollutant precursor species globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> abundance more than doubles in 2100 compared to 2005 for the RCP 8.5 scenario whilst RCP 2.6 predicts a ~25% reduction (Fig.
