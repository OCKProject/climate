<p id="Par23" class="p">Over the longer time frame out to 2100, studies of climate change impacts on air quality suggest the same effects on background O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and on O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in polluted regions as described above, but the impact is typically larger with the larger climate signal. In a multi-model study, Doherty et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] suggest annual-mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increases of up to 6 ppbv in polluted regions reaching 14 ppbv in the season of maximum O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> under the SRES A2 greenhouse gas or climate scenario. In a regional European multi-modelling study to 2050 using the SRES A1B climate scenario, Langner et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>] report that, in southern Europe, climate change leads to increased summer mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (0–3 ppbv) and increased summer daily maximum O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (3–6 ppb). In northern Europe, they found reductions (0–3 ppbv) for both mean and daily maximum O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in summer. Collette et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>] also found similar geographical patterns of projected changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> with an increase over southern continental Europe and a decrease over northern Europe and the British Isles. Several studies report climate change to have a greater impact on episodic O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (e.g., the 95th percentile of hourly O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) than on longer-term (e.g., summer-mean) averages [
