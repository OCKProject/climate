<p id="Par33" class="p">The extent of adverse health impacts from exposure to surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> depends markedly on whether a threshold concentration of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> below which no impact is assumed. A recent review by COMEAP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] suggest no evidence of a threshold or a counter-factual concentration other than zero, yet the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>] does recommend the use of a threshold of 70 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> due to greater availability of data in the warm season when lower values than this threshold are less prevalent, outside of highly polluted regions.
