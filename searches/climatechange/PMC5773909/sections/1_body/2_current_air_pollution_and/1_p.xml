<p id="Par11" class="p">Many interacting processes control the concentrations of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM at a given location: emissions, transport, transformation and deposition, all of which can be affected directly or indirectly by meteorology and climate. O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> has an average tropospheric lifetime of about a month [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. The different components of PM have varying lifetimes but typical values are around ~1–2 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Horizontal transport times across the mid-latitudes are ~2 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>], hence both O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM can be transported across continents.
