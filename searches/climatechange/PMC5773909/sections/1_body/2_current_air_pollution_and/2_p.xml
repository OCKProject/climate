<p id="Par12" class="p">Elevated air pollution associated with extreme events such as summer heat waves has received much attention in the literature. Patz et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] found heatwaves can often be associated with O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> exceedance days. In particular, the European heat wave of 2003 and the accompanying high O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels have been studied in detail [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Relevant processes identified include: persistent high-pressure systems and extended residence time in the atmospheric boundary layer, extensive forest fires, enhanced levels of natural biogenic isoprene (an O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM precursor) and suppressed dry deposition of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Wildfires have also been associated with high PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. High levels of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> are estimated to have contributed to one-third of the excess deaths occurring during the 2003 heatwave in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. In the Netherlands, Fischer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] estimated an excess of 1000–1400 deaths, with 400–600 of these deaths related to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>. For nine cities in France (where the impacts of the 2003 heatwave were largest), Filleul et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>] estimated that the excess risk of death was significant (1.01%; 95% CI, 0.58–1.44) for an O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increase of 10 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>, and highlighted the joint risk due to temperature and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Studies suggest that summer 2003 could be a normal summer in the coming decades under climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Indeed, Stott et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] estimated with &gt;90% confidence that human influence has at least doubled the risk of a heatwave equivalent to that experienced across Europe in 2003. A detailed description of the influences of meteorological and climate variables in relation to climate change effects on O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM concentrations is given below.
