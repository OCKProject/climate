<p id="Par40" class="p">Overall, the climate penalty effects on O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and possibly PM indicates that stronger emission controls will be needed in the future to avoid higher health risks associated with climate change induced worsening of air quality in populated regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. For O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related health impacts, major uncertainties, besides model uncertainty in simulated O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels, are the impacts of long-term exposure, thresholds and effect modification by temperature. For PM-related health impacts, model-to-model variability in the response of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations to climate change seems likely to be the largest source of uncertainty. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in risk estimates for O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM are also an issue for modelling health impacts. Finally, there is uncertainty regarding future potential adaptation effects into the twenty-first century.
