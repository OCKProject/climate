<p id="Par36" class="p">There are numerous studies on future changes in air quality for surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in particular, but very limited studies on the associated human health impacts. Globally, warming decreases background surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, but higher CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> levels under the latest IPCC scenario RCP8.5 more than counteract this decrease, causing increased surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Regionally, several studies suggest fairly robust climate change signals over Europe that lead to increases in summer-mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in southern Europe and less change in northern Europe. The effects for higher concentration metrics such as daily maximum O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are typically larger. For PM, studies related to climate change are still limited, and key uncertainties arise due to the differing effects of temperature on various PM components and uncertainties in future precipitation patterns. Further studies that examine the effects of climate change on PM would be beneficial.
