<p id="Par14" class="p">The impacts of important meteorological and climate variables on surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM, are summarised in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, which is based on comprehensive reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] as well as studies outlined below. The key processes that influence air quality occur through changes in temperature, water vapour, precipitation and clouds, and meteorological transport and mixing. Climate variables not only influence air pollutant concentrations but they can also act as confounding and modifying factors of air pollution concentration-health response relationships. For example, Pattenden et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] showed that adverse health effects of exposure to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were greater on the hottest days.
