<p id="Par20" class="p">Changes in climate and in climate extremes also have the potential to alter transport pathways e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>], which are influenced by the dominance and passage of both low and high pressure systems. For example, Glotfelty et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>] suggest that climate change, through an enhanced low pressure centre over eastern Russia increases intercontinental transport of air pollution from the region increasing global average O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. However, Doherty et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>], using a passive tracer approach, found that shifts in transport patterns due to climate change are unlikely to have a major role in influencing the annual-mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> response, but may be important when considering changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> metrics influenced by extreme values such as daily 8-h maximum surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. In particular, the frequency and magnitude of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM pollution episodes will likely be affected by climate change through changes in the frequency of low pressure system passage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>] or the frequency of blocking episodes. Multi-model studies show a consistent decrease in winter and summer blocking over Europe in the twenty-first century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. However, in summer the accompanying poleward shift of the storm track into the region of frequent high-latitude blocking, may lead to a greater number of storms obstructed by blocking high pressure systems in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Changes in large-scale blocking may affect local stagnation and heatwave episodes. However the relationship between blocking and stagnation remain unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. Indeed, Horton et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>] report an increase in annual-mean and springtime stagnation occurrences over Mediterranean Europe by the late twenty-first century. The authors noted that biases in modelled surface wind speeds used to create their air stagnation index were large. Overall, Kirtman et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>] concluded that evidence and agreement on the impact of climate change on transport pathways are still lacking.
