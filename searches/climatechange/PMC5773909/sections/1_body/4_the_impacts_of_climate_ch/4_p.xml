<p id="Par17" class="p">Specific humidity also plays an important role in chemistry as higher atmospheric water vapour (associated with elevated temperature) will increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> destruction in low-NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> environments e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>], causing a reduction in ‘background’ concentrations of surface O
 <sub class="sub">3.</sub> However, higher water vapour also leads to higher HO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> (OH + HO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) that enhances O

 <sub class="sub">x</sub> environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. For PM, increased water vapour alters aerosol properties and hygroscopic growth and through higher OH levels enhances SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> oxidation leading to higher particle sulphate concentrations e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. Particle nitrate levels also increase with higher humidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Rainfall frequency and amount affects wet deposition processes that remove pollutants from the atmosphere. PM concentrations decrease in areas simulated to have increased precipitation frequency and vice versa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Under climate change it is generally thought that wetter regions of the world will get wetter and drier regions drier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Cloud amount also affects the amount of incoming solar radiation and hence photolysis rates that influence surface O
 <sub class="sub">3.</sub> Several authors report increased summer surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations over Europe and the NE USA due to reduced cloud amounts that lead to enhanced photolysis rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>], particularly that of NO
