 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], and increase partitioning to the gas phase which reduces nitrate and some organic aerosol species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>], as is often the case in urban European regions. Large changes in PM are possible due to elevated emissions from biogenic and wild fire sources, yielding carbonaceous particles, mineral dust and secondary organic aerosol [
