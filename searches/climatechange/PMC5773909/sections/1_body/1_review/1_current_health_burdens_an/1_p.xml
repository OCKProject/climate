<p id="Par9" class="p">The estimated health burdens attributable to ambient air pollution are substantial. The Global Burden of Disease project estimated that exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> in 2015 contributed 4.2 million deaths globally, whilst exposure to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> contributed 0.25 million deaths globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Across the European Union (EU), the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated that about 467,000 people died prematurely in 2013 due to long-term exposure to ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. For O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, the EEA estimated that short-term exposures in 2013 contributed to more than 17,000 premature mortalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. This assumes a threshold concentration for effect of 35 ppbv (70 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>). Whilst the proportions of the EU urban population exposed to ambient PM concentrations exceeding EU limit or target values have declined in the last decade, they have varied for exposure to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> partly due to year-to-year variability in meteorology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>].
