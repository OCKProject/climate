<p id="Par10" class="p">Dose-response coefficients used to quantify the risk of mortality related to short and long-term exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. For short-term exposure, these coefficients are mainly based on the Health Risks of Air Pollution In Europe (HRAPIE) WHO project [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]; for O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> results from the Air Pollution and Health: A European and North American Approach APHENA study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] and the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) meta-analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] are also provided. For long-term exposure, findings from long-term American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort studies are given [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. For long-term exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>] suggest an increased premature mortality risk of 6.2% per 10 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> exposure measured using annual-mean PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For short-term exposure to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, an increased premature mortality risk of 0.29% per 10 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> exposure measured using daily maximum 8-h running mean O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is suggested by the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>); they also recommend a threshold of 70 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> (35 ppbv) due to greater data availability for the warm season.
