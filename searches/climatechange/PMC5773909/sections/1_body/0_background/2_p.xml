<p id="Par6" class="p">For O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, short-term exposure is associated with all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, and respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions. There is now strengthened evidence for effects of long-term exposure to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> on respiratory and cardiorespiratory mortality in warm season months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], although taken as a whole this evidence is limited at present, as it is primarily derived from studies in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. For both PM and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> there are indications that adverse effects exist down to low concentrations, such that it is hard to discern any threshold concentration. Whilst evidence has also strengthened for independent impacts of both short-term and long-term exposure to NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on mortality, hospital admissions and respiratory symptoms, because of strong correlations between NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other air pollutants it remains difficult to discern a direct effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. This, coupled with the current evidence that for both PM and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> adverse effects exist down to low concentrations, means that this review focuses predominantly on these two pollutants: O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM.
