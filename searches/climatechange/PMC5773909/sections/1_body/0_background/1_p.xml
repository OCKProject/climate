<p id="Par5" class="p">The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported strengthened evidence for adverse health effects related to exposure to particulate matter (PM), ozone (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Their evidence comes from various types of epidemiological studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. For PM, both short-term and long-term exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> (particle diameter &lt; 2.5 μm) is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Evidence now also links long-term exposure with other health outcomes including adverse birth outcomes and childhood respiratory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. There is also strengthening evidence for short-term effects on mortality and morbidity from the larger particle size fractions PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (diameter &lt; 10 μm).
