<p id="Par7" class="p">Emissions of the main air pollutant precursors: primary PM, black carbon (BC); nitrogen oxides (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>); sulphur dioxide (SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in Europe have declined in the last decade or so, resulting in improvements in air quality across the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, due to the complexities of the processes linking emissions and air quality, notably interactions with meteorology, reductions in local or regional emissions do not always produce a reduction in atmospheric concentrations. Hence air pollution remains a high profile issue, now and for the future.
