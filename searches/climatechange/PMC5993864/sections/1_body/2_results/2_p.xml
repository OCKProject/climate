 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows Bayesian path coefficients (and their 95% credibility intervals) predicting Time 2 beliefs and concern about climate change from Time 1 values controlling for the respective Time 1 beliefs and concern about climate change and gender. The 95% credibility intervals are often used in practice to decide whether the coefficients differ from zero. If the credibility interval does not include zero, the path coefficients can be seen as significant under conventional null hypothesis testing. Universalism at Time 1 was associated with Time 2 perceived consequences of climate change and climate change skepticism, but not climate change risk perception. Self-direction at Time 1 predicted Time 2 climate change risk perception and perceived consequences of climate change, but not Time 2 climate change skepticism. Hedonism at Time 1 only predicted Time 2 climate change risk perception. The other human values at Time 1 did not predict any of the measures of beliefs and concern about climate change at Time 2. This Bayesian model was correct based on the posterior predictive

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value of .51, indicating that the model does adequately represent the observed data.
