 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> displays Bayesian path coefficients predicting Time 1 beliefs and concern about climate change from Time 1 values controlling for gender. Universalism at Time 1 was related to Time 2 perceived consequences of climate change, climate change skepticism, and climate change risk perception. Hedonism at Time 1 predicted Time 1 perceived consequences of climate change and climate change skepticism but did not predict climate change risk perception. Power at Time 1 only predicted Time 1 climate change skepticism. The other human values at Time 1 did not predict any of the measures of beliefs and concern about climate change at Time 2. A posterior predictive
