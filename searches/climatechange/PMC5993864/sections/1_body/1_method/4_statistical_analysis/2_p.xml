<p id="Par20" class="p">Unlike maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing, using a Bayesian approach, each true model parameter is unknown and treated as a random variable that has a probability distribution. The distribution for the parameters is called a posterior distribution. Since to our knowledge, no study has investigated our set of hypotheses using a longitudinal design, we have performed Bayesian estimation for a model with the uniform prior distribution that Amos uses by default. By default, Amos assigns a uniform distribution from −3.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−38</sup> to 3.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">38</sup> to each parameter. In a model with the uniform prior distribution for 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>) is completely flat. In addition, the posterior distribution is a re-normalized version of the likelihood of the observed data. Using the percentiles of the marginal posterior distribution, it is possible to compute the analogue of a confidence interval. We selected an interval that runs from the 2.5 percentile to the 97.5 percentile and forms a Bayesian 95% credible interval. Unlike conventional confidence intervals, the Bayesian credible intervals can be conceptualized as probability statements about the parameters themselves. When Prob (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) = 0.95, we are 95% sure that the alternative hypothesis is true, that is, there is a probability of 95% that that the true value of 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> lies between 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>. As a means of evaluating the quality of the fit of the model, we focused on posterior predictive 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values (Lee and Song 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2004</xref>). A posterior predictive 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value near .5 indicate that the model is plausible, that is, little or any discrepancy between data generated by the model and the actual data itself (Gelman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>).
