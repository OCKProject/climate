<p id="Par14" class="p">We used a set of nine items from a previous study (Bostrom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>) that includes perceived potential consequences of climate change to society, modified slightly to encompass perceived damages to the ecosystem (e.g., damages to the marine ecosystems). Item examples are “More and longer droughts in many parts of the world” and “More and larger storms in many parts of the world.” Respondents were asked to rate for each item how likely it is as a consequence of climate change. Responses were given on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 = 
 <italic class="italic">extremely unlikely</italic> to 10 = 
 <italic class="italic">extremely likely</italic>.
