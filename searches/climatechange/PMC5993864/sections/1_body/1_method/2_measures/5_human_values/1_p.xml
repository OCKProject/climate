<p id="Par17" class="p">We used the Italian validated version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire (Capanna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2005</xref>; Schwartz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2001</xref>) to measure the 10 basic values. This questionnaire includes short verbal portraits of 40 different people. Each portrait defines a person’s objectives, aspirations, or desires that reflect a specific value. For each portrait, the respondents were asked to answer to the following question: “How much like you is this person?” using a response format ranging from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">not like me at all</italic>) to 6 (
 <italic class="italic">very much like me</italic>).
