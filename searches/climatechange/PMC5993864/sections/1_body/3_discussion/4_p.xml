<p id="Par27" class="p">The results of the present study do not provide evidence that self-transcendence values are consistently associated with beliefs and concern about climate change because benevolence did not relate to any of the measures of beliefs and concern about climate change. Previous studies revealed that universalism values are more strongly related to environmentally responsible beliefs and behavior than benevolence values (e.g., Axelrod 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1994</xref>; Gärling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">1999</xref>; Schultz and Zelezny 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1999</xref>). The results of the present study indicated that when it comes to beliefs and concern about climate change, benevolence values are not relevant. This is interesting given that benevolence and universalism values were strongly interrelated (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). One reason for this result could be that concern for the welfare of people with whom one is in frequent personal contact (i.e., benevolence) and the welfare of all people and nature (i.e., universalism) may sometimes conflict with each other when it comes to pro-environmental outcomes (Thøgersen and Ölander 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2002</xref>). For example, energy consumption is considered one of the major issues under the changing climate (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2014</xref>): the concern for the welfare of close others in everyday interaction may require energy consumption (e.g., electric energy consumption, oil consumption) that is in conflict with the concern for nature and environment.
