<p id="Par24" class="p">The current study aimed to investigate the extent to which human values measured at Time 1 and beliefs and concern about climate change measured at Time 2 are related when controlling for Time 1 beliefs and concern about climate change (auto-regressive effects). Our findings did not lend strong support to the first and the second hypotheses. Specifically, we found that (1) among self-transcendent values, universalism (but not benevolence) was related to higher levels of perceived consequences of climate change (0.46, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> 0.27, 0.66) and lower levels of climate change skepticism (−0.24, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.45, −0.01); (2) among self-enhancing values, achievement did not relate to lower levels of perceived consequences of climate change (−0.01, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.21, 0.19) and climate change risk perception (0.00, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.21, 0.21) and higher levels of climate change skepticism (−0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.26, 0.16). Also, power was not associated with lower levels of perceived consequences of climate change (−0.16, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.31, 0.00) and climate change risk perception (−0.08, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.24, 0.08) and higher levels of climate change skepticism (−0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.22, 0.11). The relationship between hedonism at Time 1 and climate change risk perception at Time 2 was significant and, as expected, had a negative sign (−0.19, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.34, −0.04). However, hedonism did not predict perceived consequences of climate (0.01, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.13, 0.15) and climate change skepticism (0.07, 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic> −0.09, 0.23).
