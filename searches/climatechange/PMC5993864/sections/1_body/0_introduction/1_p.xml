 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>). People show varying levels of engagement with climate change (Leiserowitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2013</xref>). There are differences among people, such that some people tend to be concerned about the existence of climate change whereas others tend to be skeptical about the reality and severity of climate change (Whitmarsh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, previous research has identified differences with respect to the extent to which people feel threatened (risk perception) and perceive the consequences associated with climate change (Bostrom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>; Leiserowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2006</xref>). In summary, the beliefs and concern about climate change are reflected in varying levels of perceived consequences of climate change, climate change risk perception and climate change skepticism (Whitmarsh
