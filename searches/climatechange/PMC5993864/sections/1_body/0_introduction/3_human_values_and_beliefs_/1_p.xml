<p id="Par4" class="p">According to Schwartz (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1992</xref>), human values are defined as “a desirable transsituational goal varying in importance, which serves as a guiding principle in the life of a person or other social entity.” Human values are conceptualized as relatively stable dimensions although they may change in response to socio-cultural changes (Inglehart 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2008</xref>) or extreme events (Prati and Zani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). Although different conceptualizations of values co-exist in the literature, the Value Theory (Schwartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">1994</xref>) has been dominant in social psychology and is considered useful in examining values in relation to climate change (O’Brien and Wolf 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2010</xref>). Specifically, the Value Theory (Schwartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">1994</xref>) posits that there are four universal distinct clusters that structure ten motivational value types. These four higher order value types are organized in two bipolar dimensions: openness to change (hedonism, self-direction, and stimulation) versus conservation (security, tradition, and conformity), and self-enhancement (hedonism, achievement, and power) versus self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence).
