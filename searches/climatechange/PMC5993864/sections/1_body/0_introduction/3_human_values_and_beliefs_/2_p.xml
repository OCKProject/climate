<p id="Par5" class="p">According to the spillover hypothesis (Thøgersen and Crompton

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>). The spillover hypothesis is derived from self-perception theory (Bem 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1972</xref>) which postulates that the engagement in pro-environmental behavior makes pro-environmental values and norms more salient. Since pro-environmental behaviors can be performed for environmental concern as well as for economic gain, Corner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>) postulates that a focus on self-enhancing values will make behavioral ‘spillover’ less likely because personal gain (e.g., economic) was the main incentive for the behavior. On the contrary, the salience of self-transcendent values in the general population will promote engagement with climate change on different aspects of the issue due to the spillover effect. Based on this theory, Corner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>) concluded that self-transcendence values are expected to be strongly associated with positive engagement with climate change, while self-enhancing values appear less congruent with positive engagement with climate change. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that self-transcendence values would be positively related to higher levels of environmental concern, specifically about climate change, while self-enhancing values would be related to lower levels of concern about climate change.
