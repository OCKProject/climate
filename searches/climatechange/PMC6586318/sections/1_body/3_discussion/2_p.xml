 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], distance and habitat variability were not demonstrably influential in reciprocal planting experiments; population size of origin plants was the strongest predictor of provenance-trial success. We documented results along a similar vein: despite dramatic environmental differences in seed origin, factors influencing seedling survival acted in the same direction for each species, albeit with varying magnitudes of effect in some instances.
