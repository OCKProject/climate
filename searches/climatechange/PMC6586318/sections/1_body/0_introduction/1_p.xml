 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Montane plant communities in widely separated intact natural environments of the world have responded to changes in precipitation and temperature regimes by shifting ranges upward in elevation, moving upslope over 20 m per decade in some instances [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Reduced evapotranspiration rates in cooler climate zones at higher elevation may compensate for less precipitation and more extreme temperatures within species’ former ranges. Plants with short generation times and faster population turnover, such as grasses, may be able to quickly disperse upward [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]; however, longer-lived plants that mature more slowly may suffer ‘migration lag’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and consequently fail to keep pace with the rising elevation of climate zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Alternatively, changes to precipitation patterns in some cases have resulted in downslope movements both within and beyond a species’ range [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Crimmins et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] documented downslope movement across species’ ranges, supporting the idea that entire populations are shifting in response to changes in water availability caused by climate change, as opposed to responding to temperature. Another cause of downslope movement may be novel inter-species competition caused by competitive release [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. HilleRisLambers et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] found both; seedlings were limited by competition at lower range limits, while climate effects were observed at upper range limits for adults and saplings. In either scenario montane populations are predicted to become more fragmented and isolated, increasing risk of local extinctions caused by stochastic events [
