<p class="p">On the basis of the bulk of empirical research, polar bears are officially classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; 2017) and threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Cooley et al. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This status has received considerable attention, given their cultural significance and charismatic nature (Stirling and Derocher

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) is the most important threat to polar bearsâ€™ long-term survival. Although the effects of warming on some polar-bear subpopulations are not yet documented and other subpopulations are apparently still faring well, the fundamental relationship between polar-bear welfare and sea-ice availability is well established, and unmitigated AGW assures that all polar bears ultimately will be negatively affected. Indeed, credible estimates suggest that the entire Arctic may be ice-free during summer within several decades (Snape and Forster

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), a process that, as has been suggested by both theoretical and empirical evidence, will drastically reduce polar-bear populations across their range (Amstrup et al.
