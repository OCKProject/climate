<p class="p">A growing body of scientific research reports the wide array of negative effects of AGW on biodiversity (Walther et al. 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>, Parmesan 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), with the Arctic being particularly affected (Post et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Given that the implications of AGW pervade almost all aspects of ecology (Parmesan 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) and society (Karl et al. 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), deniers often focus their attention on observations that, when taken out of context, they can frame in a way that appears to contradict or downplay the severity of climate impacts. Another strategy is to selectively attack prominent lines of research providing compelling evidence of AGW. Mann and colleagues’ (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>) “hockey-stick” graph (see also Mann 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), in which temperature reconstructions have been made over the past millennium, is a prime example of the latter. Polar bears (
 <italic class="italic">Ursus maritimus</italic>) are also a prominent focus of blogs in the debate over AGW and its biological effects. Because polar bears depend on a habitat that literally melts as temperatures rise, these animals are iconic symbols of the negative effects of AGW (Manzo 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). At the same time, many denier blogs pay little or no attention to the volumes of physical evidence for AGW and the empirical biological and ecological evidence of its effects (Nisbet 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Because this evidence is so overwhelming, it would be virtually impossible to debunk; the main strategy of denier blogs is therefore to focus on topics that are showy and in which it is therefore easy to generate public interest. These topics are used as “proxies” for AGW in general; in other words, they represent 
 <italic class="italic">keystone dominoes</italic> that are strategically placed in front of many hundreds of others, each representing a separate line of evidence for AGW. By appearing to knock over the keystone domino, audiences targeted by the communication may assume all other dominoes are toppled in a form of “dismissal by association.” Proponents of creationism and intelligent design use the same strategy: Instead of providing scientific evidence in favor of their opinions, they instead focus selectively on certain lines of evidence for evolution and attempt to cast doubt on them (Nisbet 2009). They then use this as an argument to support their own views, even if these have no conceptual or empirical support.
