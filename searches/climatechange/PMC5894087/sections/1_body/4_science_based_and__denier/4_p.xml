<p class="p">A primary approach of Crockford's and other denier blogs is to frame uncertainty by focusing on the present and to question the accuracy of future predictions—implying that the rapid loss of Arctic ice recorded over the past 40 years induced by AGW cannot serve as a guide to future conditions. This contrasts with the scientific consensus that polar bears will ultimately disappear if Arctic sea-ice declines continue unabated (Amstrup et al. 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Despite the roughly linear relationship between observed sea-ice decline and global mean temperature (Amstrup et al. 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), biological responses are often nonlinear. As in other ecosystems, when critical thresholds in habitat availability are passed, tipping points occur, and species dependent on that habitat suddenly experience sharp declines (Dai et al. 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moreover, habitat loss is not always immediately followed by abundance declines of species dependent on that habitat. Instead, the phenomenon of “extinction debt” can create temporal gaps between the two processes (Kuussaari et al. 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). These important aspects, vital to our understanding of future prospects for species in shrinking habitats, including polar bears, are ignored by Crockford's and other AGW-denying blogs.
