<p class="p">Denier blogs that downplay the threats of AGW to Arctic ice and polar bears rely heavily on arguments that it has been warmer in the past, that temperature and seasonal ice extent vary naturally over time, and that it is therefore difficult or even impossible to predict what will happen in the future. This framing ignores the fact that scientists agree that natural short-term fluctuations in weather and climate will persist along with secular trends of global warming and declining ice. Also, previous global-warming events were a part of natural cycles of warming and cooling driven by orbital factors. Summer sea ice did not disappear entirely during past interglacial periods (Stein et al. 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), as it ultimately will with unabated GHG rise. And even if dramatically reduced, ice extent always recovered when warm interglacial periods were followed by waning insolation and cooling temperatures. Current global warming, in contrast, is driven by rising GHG concentrations, is occurring despite reduced insolation, and cannot be reversed without mitigating GHG rise (Brigham-Grette 2009, Tzedakis et al. 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, Barnhart et al. 2013, Stocker et al. 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Moreover, sea-ice habitat reductions during past interglacial periods occurred over millennia (rather than over the decadal scales that accompany AGW), giving the bears more time to adjust their behavior and distribution. Bears today also face multiple additional threats, including chemical bioaccumulation, on-the-ground habitat manipulation, and human harvesting, factors that were absent during past warming episodes (Stirling and Derocher 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Because current warming cannot be reversed without human action (Stocker et al. 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), the prognosis for polar bears and other Arctic biota without GHG mitigation is bleak (Stirling and Derocher 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, Regehr et al. 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). These facts are not accurately reflected in the views expressed by denier blogs.
