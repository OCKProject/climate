<p class="p">The considerable influence that blogs exert on public opinion and decision-making should not be underestimated. Among users, trust for blogs has been reported to exceed that of other traditional news or information sources (Johnson and Kay 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). In our opinion, combatting ­distortions of AGW in blogs and other online sources requires a greater level of direct engagement between scientists, the public, and the media. We strongly believe that scientists have a professional and moral obligation not only to inform the public about the findings and implications of their research but also to counter misinformation, especially where vested interests are concerned (Mann 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, there appears to be a reticence on the part of many scientists to enter the public arena and especially to challenge the unscientific arguments propounded by AGW deniers (Hansen 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The reasons for this reticence are many and varied and include balancing arguments for “crying wolf” against the implications of “fiddling while Rome burns” (Hansen 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Furthermore, there is reluctance among many scientists to counter the scientific distortions of deniers because there is no traditional reward system for academics to engage in what amounts to “trench warfare.” Indeed, there is a concern, not necessarily unfounded, that speaking out may actually harm one's career prospects (Barber 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1961</xref>, Nordhagen et al 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). There is also a tradition for scientists to focus on the remaining uncertainties in their knowledge, which still require investigation, rather than the certainties that require no more attention. Scientific focus on uncertainties, although a critical part of science, provides the “grain for the grist mill” of the blog deniers, and scientists need to more effectively express established certainties while placing remaining uncertainties into their appropriate context. Finally, we feel that many scientists mistakenly believe that debates with deniers over the causes and consequences of climate change are purely science driven when in reality the situation with deniers is probably more akin to a street fight (Nature Editors 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) based on those deniers’ political or economic agendas (Oreskes and Conway 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, Farrell 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016b</xref>)—something that urgently needs to be recognized.
