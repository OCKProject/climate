<p class="p">Pimm and Harvey (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>) provided three criteria with which to evaluate the credibility of scientific studies. First and most importantly, follow the data. They emphasized that the data trails of skeptics generally go cold very quickly. Second, follow the money. Some of the most prominent AGW deniers, including Crockford, are linked with or receive support from organizations that downplay AGW (e.g., Dr. Crockford has previously been paid for report writing by the Heartland Institute). Third, follow the credentials. As we have illustrated here, scientists such as Crockford who are described as “experts” on denier blogs in fact typically have little in the way of relevant expertise, and their expertise is often self-manufactured to serve alternative agendas. These criteria confirm that many denier blogs are deliberately distorting science to promote predetermined worldviews and political or economic agendas (Oreskes and Conway 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, Dunlap 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). A fourth criterion that we can add here is to follow the language. As Whitmarsh (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) explained, those who deny AGW do not hesitate to attack their opponents with insults, and have smeared scientists by calling them names such as “eco-­fascists,” “fraudsters,” or “green terrorists” or by accusing them of being part of a global “scam” or “hoax.”
