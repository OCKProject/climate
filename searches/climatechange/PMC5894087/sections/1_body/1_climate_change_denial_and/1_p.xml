<p class="p">Recent evidence shows that climate-change denial involves a growing labyrinthine network of corporations, conservative foundations, think tanks, and the mainstream media (Farrell

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016b</xref>). Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media outlets also provide powerful voices in the battle for public opinion, and Internet blogs have become major conduits for disseminating various views on AGW (Nisbet and Kotcher

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). A 
 <italic class="italic">blog</italic> is a website that contains regularly updated online personal ideas, comments, and/or hyperlinks provided by the writer (Nisbet and Kotcher 2013). The Internet is open to public use, and individuals or organizations can set up blogs and promote their perspectives on virtually any topic, irrespective of their societal importance or validity. Many societally important topics are discussed and debated on blogs, and some heavily visited blogs have strong effects on public opinion and even political decision-making (Oreskes and Conway

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Watts Up With That</italic> (WUWT), which consistently denies AGW and/or threats linked to it, is described as “perhaps the most visited climate website in the world,” with “more than two million unique views a month” (Pearce 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Other AGW-denying blogs, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Climate Depot</italic> (CD) and 
 <italic class="italic">Junk Science</italic> (JS), are not far behind. Many denier blogs exist and, because of cross-linking, form a large echo chamber, making them what one journalist described as “foot soldiers of AGW denial” (Renowden 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Despite the growing evidence in support of AGW, these blogs continue to aggressively deny the causes and/or the projected effects of AGW and to personally attack scientists who publish peer-reviewed research in the field with the aim of fomenting doubt to maintain the consensus gap.
