<p class="p">In the semi-natural foraging environment the evidence for an interaction between DTR and MinT was also robust: excluding the interaction decreased model fit with at least 3.3 AICc and models without the interaction all had weights ≤0.04 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Note however that coefficients for the DTR*MinT interaction were in the opposite direction compared to the easy environment (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Indeed large DTR increased mortality on warm days, but not on cold days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>). Note that for DTR the coefficient in the best fitting model is larger in the semi-natural than in the easy environment on days with MinT of 6 °C, which is the mean MinT at our study location (2.04 vs. 1.36 respectively in the best fitting model). This implies an increase of 1 °C DTR has a stronger effect in the semi-natural than in the easy foraging environment (increases in mortality rate per °C DTR of 104% vs. 36% respectively). Thus in the semi-natural foraging environment large DTR increased mortality on warm days but not on cold days, opposite to the pattern in the easy foraging environment.
