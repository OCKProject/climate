Estimating the time frame over which the climatic variables best explained mortality showed that the effects were most pronounced the day preceding the event (i.e. the survival or death of an individual), accounting for 77% and 15% of the weight for MinT and DTR respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The time window over which MinT affected mortality was much shorter than DTR (8.9 &lt; ΔAICc &lt; 12.5, see methods for details on test). For MinT, (almost) 80% of the effect was captured the day before the event, while reaching 80% for DTR required 3 months (
