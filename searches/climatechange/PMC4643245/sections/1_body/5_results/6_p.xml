 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), and the association between DTR and mortality can therefore be confounded with other climatic variables with similar seasonal variation as DTR. We captured the seasonal variation of climatic variables by adding photoperiod as a covariate to the best models of 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables S2, S3 and S4</xref>. Photoperiod was in no case significant (0.23 &lt;

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &lt; 2.29, 0.13 &lt;p &lt; 0.63), never improved the model fit (0.3 &lt; ΔAICc &lt; 6), and the effect on the model coefficients of DTR, MinT or their interaction was negligible. We therefore conclude that DTR contributes to mortality independently of the seasonal variation of other (climatic) variables.
