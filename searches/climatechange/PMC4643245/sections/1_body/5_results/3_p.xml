<p class="p">In the easy foraging environment, the effect of DTR was most pronounced on cold days (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>): birds experienced an up to ten-fold increase in mortality over the DTR range in our dataset. Evidence for this is robust since all selected models (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) included DTR and the interaction between DTR and MinT. Thus, in the easy foraging environment, we found that large DTR increased mortality on cold days, but not on warm days.
