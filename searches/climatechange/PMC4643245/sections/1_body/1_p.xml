<p class="p">DTR responses independent of mean temperature can occur following Jensen’s inequality

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>: when there are nonlinear associations between a system and its environment, mean system state will change in response to increased environmental variation even when the environment mean remains constant (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Endotherms might also be susceptible to DTR but knowledge of DTR effects in endotherms is restricted to humans, where the elderly experience up to 3% increase in hospital admissions and 1% increase in mortality per 1 °C increase in DTR

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. However, elderly humans behave very differently from endotherms in natural environments that are permanently exposed to natural variation in temperature. Thus the demographic and ecological consequences of changes in DTR in endotherms in natural environments remain unknown.
