<p class="p">We used a model selection approach to find the model best supported by the data. To this end we followed Burnham and Anderson model selection approach
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>, based on Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) with the function ‘dredge’ of the package ‘MuMIn’
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref>. In brief, this is a hypothesis-based approach that generates, given a global model, subset models that best fit the data. This makes it possible to assess model support for each hypothesis tested. Model support is shown here by ranking all subset models within 4 AICc of the best model fit. Weighted DTR and MinT were mean centered in all analyses.
