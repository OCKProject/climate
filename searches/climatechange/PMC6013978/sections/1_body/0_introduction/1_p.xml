<p class="p">The term ‘stakeholder’ may refer to an individual, group, party, community and organisation that has potential to influence or be influenced by adaptation strategies or programmes (Vervoort et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In sub-Saharan Africa, stakeholder groups with diverging interests find themselves responding to the impacts of climate change on socio-ecological systems (Dunford et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Vervoort et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The impacts of climate change are multi-scaled, stretching from the individual and national up to global level. Climate change has differential impacts amongst stakeholders across different geographical scales and thus presents an adaptation equity problem (Tol et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Despite differences in power, vision, values and focus, the stakeholders have a common goal regarding adaptation to climate change stressors. Traditionally, linear responses to climate change impacts on socio-ecological systems were promoted, but these have become weak especially in rural African communities mainly because of heterogeneous livelihoods (Vervoort et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The response to differential impacts of climate change on households is further weakened by some unintended outcomes of scientific innovations supported by politicians, government sectors and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (Chambers 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>; Mbereko et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>). Thus, there is need for demand-driven adaptation strategies to climate change that will co-evolve with social actors in the political economy context (Vervoort et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, the adaptive capacity of local stakeholders at the household level is enhanced or inhibited by stakeholders from the village to the national level. Hence, this article seeks to understand household interpretation of and adaptation strategies towards climate change stressors in the context of the local political economy.
