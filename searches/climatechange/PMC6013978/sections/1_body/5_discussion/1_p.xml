<p class="p">This study reports the Ntalale communityâ€™s experiences and responses to climate change in the existing institutional framework. There are a number of climatic phenomena that are being affected by climate change, but not all of them affect every part of the globe equally (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). In this study, the participants have experienced four weather conditions that are related to climate change; these are rainfall variability, poor rainy season (droughts), floods and heatwaves. A number of studies in rural Zimbabwe have focussed on rainfall variability, droughts, temperature increases and floods (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Chikozho 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). It is also important to note that research shows that rural communities are aware of the changing climatic conditions (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Mtambanengwe et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Mubaya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Knowledge of the changing climate affords an opportunity for rural communities to understand the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods. This study demonstrates that people from the Ntalale area are aware of climate change phenomena affecting them and their implications on their livelihoods. However, some are reluctant to develop adaptation strategies. For example, some people still grow the long-season variety crops even though they have observed that in the past 10 years the rainy season has been shorter with intra-season dry spells. The data presented here demonstrate that the impacts of changing climatic phenomena negatively affected the people. The IPCC report argues that climate change will benefit some regions and disadvantage others (Stocker et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The findings of this study contribute to the literature that demonstrates that the southern African region is being negatively affected by climate change (Chikozho 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Mubaya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
