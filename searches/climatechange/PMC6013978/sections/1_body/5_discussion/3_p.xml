<p class="p">The Ntalale community has identified and discussed the adaptation strategies used in their ward (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The Ntalale community was avoiding dry uplands in favour of the wetlands grooves where germination and maturity chances of crops were higher. In Zimbabwe, research has demonstrated that wetlands are key farming resources and have been used over a long time by communities (Mbereko et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>). However, the Environmental Management Agency, through the 
 <italic class="italic">Environmental Management Act</italic> 2002, prohibits the use of wetlands for agriculture in Zimbabwe (Mbereko et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>). The rural communities are increasingly cultivating on wetlands as a way to adapt to the frequent droughts. However, wetlands are also prone to flooding (Mbereko et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>), thus the Ntalale communities used plant phenology as an indicator of a good or bad rainy season and the decision to plough upland or wetland was based on the indigenous knowledge (Macherera et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The alterations in planting systems were practiced by some members of the community. FGD participants complained of germination and crop failure in extreme dry conditions if one planted drought-resistant crops or practiced dry planting.
