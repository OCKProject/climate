<p class="p">This article presents findings of a component of a bigger study on the prevalence of malaria and bilharzia in the context of climate change. The bigger study was conducted in wards 11, 15 and 18 in Gwanda rural district in Zimbabwe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). However, Ward 11 also called Ntalale ward, was purposively sampled because it experiences more frequent droughts and floods (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The province is located in the south western part of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is divided into five natural ecological regions on the basis of rainfall patterns and topography. Gwanda lies in Region 5 found in the lowland areas of the country, lying up to 900 m above sea level and receiving annual rainfall of less than 650 mL (Macherera et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The region is characterised by high temperatures (with an annual average of 21 
 <sup class="sup">Â°</sup>C) and mid-season dry spells (Macherera et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The main economic activities in the province include mining and livestock rearing and crop production is practiced but limited to drought tolerant crops. Ntalale is one of the 24 wards in Gwanda rural district which is semi-arid.
