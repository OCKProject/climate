 </sup>. RCP4.5 is considered an intermediate scenario that assumes emissions reduction during the century through the employment of clean technologies and stringent climate policies. This scenario predicts a global forcing radiation of ~4.5 W m

On the other hand, RCP8.5 is a kind of business-as-usual scenario characterized by no implementation of climate policies, lower rate of technology development, high energy intensity and resilience on fossil fuels that will lead to higher emissions than RCP4.5 over time.
