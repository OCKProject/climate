<p id="Par27" class="p">We used baseline (1961–2005) and projected rainfall data that are available from the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) from 2007 to 2099. These data were generated for South-America by the Eta RCM at 0.20° × 0.20° spatial resolution that has been used to downscale output from the two GCMs HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 forced by two different RCPs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
