<p id="Par30" class="p">We obtained 12 multiplicative factors, one for each month, using the overlap period (1980–2005) and corrected model precipitation for baseline (1961–2005) and future periods (2007–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2099). Results of the bias correction for the overlap period are shown in Supplementary Figs
