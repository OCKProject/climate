 </sup>. The addition of water vapor in the atmosphere influences climate circulation patterns, thus modifying the intensity, frequency and incidence of extreme rainfall events. In warm climates, such as in Brazil, temperature and extreme rainfall events will increase more significantly than in many other regions around the world
