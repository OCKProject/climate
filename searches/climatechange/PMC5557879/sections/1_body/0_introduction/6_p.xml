<p id="Par7" class="p">To support strategic climate change studies and the Brazilian Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, National Institute for Space Research (INPE) carried out four sets of downscaling simulations using the Eta RCM forced by medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios of HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 GCMs. The choice of these two models was based on their satisfactory simulation of precipitation and atmospheric circulation over South America, and on the easy data availability made possible by the British Atmospheric Data Centre and National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan
