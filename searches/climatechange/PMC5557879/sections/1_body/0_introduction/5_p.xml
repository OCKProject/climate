 </sup>. However, GCMs usually provide global data at a rather coarse resolution (grid size about 100–200 km) so that for climate change impact studies, it is usually necessary to downscale GCM simulations using Regional Climate Models (RCM) to provide spatially more detailed data and resolve regional or local forcings
