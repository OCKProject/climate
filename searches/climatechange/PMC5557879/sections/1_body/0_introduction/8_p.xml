<p id="Par9" class="p">The objective of this study is to assess the climate change influence on rainfall erosivity across Brazil. We used observed rainfall data (1980–2013) and downscaled climate model output (baseline, 1961–2005, and projected, 2007–2099) from the GCMs HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 forced by RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. This study provides an overview (past and projections) of the regions of Brazil where projected changes in rainfall erosivity are the greatest and discusses the potential impacts on croplands across the country.</p>
