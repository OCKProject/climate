<p id="Par4" class="p">Rainfall erosivity is the potential of rainfall to cause soil erosion by raindrop impact and surface wash out when infiltration capacity is exceeded. It is commonly represented by the R-factor in soil erosion prediction models such as Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)

 </sup> and it revised version (RUSLE)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. As rainfall is the driving force of water erosion, the rainfall erosivity is an important factor in the USLE and its revised versions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
