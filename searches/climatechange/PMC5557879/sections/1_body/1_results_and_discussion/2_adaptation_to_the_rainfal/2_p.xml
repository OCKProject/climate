 </sup>. Regions in which models indicate a decrease in mean rainfall erosivity tend to be more attractive for agricultural expansion, due to the consequent decrease in associated potential soil loss. Although there might be decreases in soil loss associated with decreases in rainfall erosivity, the conversion of natural land cover into croplands tends to increase soil loss rates by an order of magnitude or more, if not done with effective conservation practices
