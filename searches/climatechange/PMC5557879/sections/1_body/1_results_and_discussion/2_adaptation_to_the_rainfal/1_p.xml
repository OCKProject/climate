<p id="Par17" class="p">More important than the projected impacts of climate change in rainfall erosivity is the identification of how the country can adapt to these changes by adopting strategies for decreasing vulnerabilities and increasing resilience. Public policies that aim for soil and water conservation must be encouraged and implemented at the level of the land managers. Our study provides important information about what we can expect in the future regarding the soil erosion potential over Brazil. The impacts of climate change for additional factors need to be assessed to provide a more effective and precise guidance of land-use and sustainable planning, such as the drought index, water availability, agricultural land aptitude and local infrastructure. Thus, allied with these additional types of information, our results may be useful for developing a soil and water conservation plan for Brazilian regions.</p>
