<p id="Par21" class="p">The North, Central-West and Southeast regions are projected to experience decreases in rainfall erosivity in 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, especially during the latter half. This will occur probably due to the reduction of SACZ activity which is responsible for a great part of the rainfall amounts in these regions. The decrease in rainfall erosivity will generate less soil loss rates in the regions, and it is projected that agricultural production in North (Amazon) and Central-West (Cerrado) will increase. Thus, more natural vegetation cover may be converted to croplands, as discussed previously by Oliveira

 </sup> and our projections suggests that the decrease in rainfall erosivity may create the ideal conditions to continue the recent expansion in the culture of this crop. Previous studies indicated that Brazilian sugar cane production needs to increase in order to meet domestic demand on biofuels
