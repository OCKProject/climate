 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for MIROC5 and HadGEM2-ES, respectively. This region has the lowest mean rainfall erosivity of Brazilian regions. Furthermore, we note a great range in erosivity for this region, likely because it includes a semiarid area called Caatinga (low values) and a part of the Brazilian coast (high values). The HadGEM2-ES scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) project decreases from −1% to −25% in rainfall erosivity for the future periods, with accentuated values for the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The MIROC5 results yield changes from zero to −11% during the century for the two emissions scenarios. Although the average values indicate a decrease, there are areas where an increase in rainfall erosivity is projected. The RCP4.5 scenario from both models and the RCP8.5 scenario from MIROC5 indicate that the central area of Northeast is expected to have the greatest increases, while the RCP8.5 scenario from HadGEM2-ES project an increase only in the coastal area.
