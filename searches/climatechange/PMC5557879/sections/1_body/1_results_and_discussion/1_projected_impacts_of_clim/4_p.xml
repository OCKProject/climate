 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the baseline period. Overall, we noted a decrease in the average rainfall erosivity in the Central-West region for all models and scenarios compared to the baseline. For both scenarios, MIROC5 projected decreases in erosivity varying from −5% to −9% (increases were projected only in the south of Mato Grosso do Sul state). HadGEM2-ES projected decreases by as much as −18% with the RCP8.5 emission scenario.
