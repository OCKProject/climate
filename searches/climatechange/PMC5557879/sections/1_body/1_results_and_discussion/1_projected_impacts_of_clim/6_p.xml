 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. MIROC5 projected increases in the mean annual rainfall erosivity of more than 9%. In general, most scenarios projected a strong increase in rainfall erosivity over the South region. This increase has the potential to increase soil erosion rates, which may ultimately affect the productivity of primary croplands of the South region, which are responsible for a significant part of Brazilian agricultural production (see Supplementary Fig.
