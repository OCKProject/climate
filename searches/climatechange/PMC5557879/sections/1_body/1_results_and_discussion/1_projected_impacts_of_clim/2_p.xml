<p id="Par11" class="p">In the North region, we calculated mean values of rainfall erosivity of 12,885 and 13,167 MJ mm ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> h
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> during the baseline period for HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5, respectively. From HadGEM2-ES and both scenarios, we note a decrease of −7% to −20% in the mean rainfall erosivity in this region with a slight increase in the western part and a strong increase in the northern part of this region. We also found similar results using MIROC5 for both scenarios, with decreases ranging from −6% to −10%. The greatest decrease in rainfall erosivity is expected for the end of the 21
