<p id="Par16" class="p">The decrease in the rainfall erosivity over the North, Northeast, Central-West and Southeast regions and the increase for the South region projected by the scenarios may be consequences of the intensification of frequency and magnitude of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the anomalous warming in equatorial Pacific Ocean (Peru and Ecuador coast) which causes climatic variation on broad regions of the Earth. In Brazil, it causes negative anomalies in annual rainfall in the North, Northeast, Central-West and part of Southeast, and positive anomalies in the South

 </sup>. The SASM takes place in the January, February, and March (JFM) period and is responsible for the rainy season in Brazil. Moreover, JFM contributes a great part of the annual rainfall erosivity in all Brazilian regions

 </sup>. Once that ENSO decreases the convective activity of the SACZ, a decrease in rainfall and rainfall erosivity is expected for regions from North to Southeast. On the other hand, the increase in rainfall erosivity projected for the central portion of Northeast can be explained by the intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) – with a large magnitude in RCP 4.5 – which causes increases in rainfall amounts and extreme rainfall events in this part of Northeast, especially during the rainy season (summer)
