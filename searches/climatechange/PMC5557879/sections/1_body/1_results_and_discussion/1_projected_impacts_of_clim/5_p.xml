 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5, respectively. The HadGEM2-ES scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) project a decrease in the mean rainfall erosivity of up to −20%, reaching −41% in the latter part of the century. Some areas of the Southeast can reach very low rainfall erosivity values only observed in the Northeast in baseline period. Similar to HadGEM2-ES, but in a lesser magnitude, the MIROC5 scenarios also projected a decrease in mean rainfall erosivity that ranged from −5% to −11% for the Southeast region during the 21
