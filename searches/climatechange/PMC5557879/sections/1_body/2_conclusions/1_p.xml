<p id="Par22" class="p">In this study, we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity over Brazil using bias-corrected baseline (1961–2005) and projected (2007–2099) precipitation data. The latter were taken from downscaled data of two GCMs, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5, forced by two greenhouses emissions scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The average values of rainfall erosivity of each Brazilian region were calculated and compared with scenario projections.</p>
