The HadGEM2-ES scenarios project a decrease in mean rainfall erosivity in Central-West (−7% to −18%), North (−7% to −20%), Northeast (−1% to −25%), Southeast (−20% to −41%) regions, and both increases and decreases in the South region (−6% to 11%). The MIROC5 scenarios project decreases in mean rainfall erosivity in the Central-West (−5% to −9%), North (−6% to −10%), Northeast (zero to −11%) and Southeast (−5% to −11%) regions, and increases in the South (9% to 33%). It is important to note that the mean values of change in erosivity presented in this paper represent the mean changes in large areas (Brazilian regions), while inside these areas we found both increases and decreases, highlighting the occurrence of spatial variability of rainfall erosivity over Brazil.
