<p id="Par24" class="p">Brazil plays an important role in global agricultural production, which will likely be affected by climate change. For example, the possible increase in rainfall erosivity in the South region may affect a significant portion of Brazilâ€™s agricultural production due the increase in soil loss rates and decrease in soil fertility and water availability. On the other hand, the suggested decrease in rainfall erosivity over North and Northeast regions may reinforce the trend of agribusiness development in these areas. To enhance the resilience to climate changes, effective public policies focusing on sustainable agriculture and conservation practices must be implemented, ensuring water and food security. In this study, we present expected or potential trends. We do not intend to predict exactly what will happen quantitatively in the future for any specific piece of agricultural land. More important is that the country, comprising government, industry, farmers, smallholders and society, is prepared for changes in erosivity regardless of the scenarios that may occur.</p>
