<p class="p">As regards the energy substitution effect, under future scenarios in which domestic roundwood production, HWP usage, and energy use are all promoted, a maximum nationwide carbon emissions reduction volume of 4.3 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is obtained by 2050, with the greatest contribution coming from increased use of logging residue. In addition, upwards of 50 % of the reduction volume is derived from east and west Japan, influenced by the fact that these regions have a large volume of roundwood production, which is a source of logging residue.
