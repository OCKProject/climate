<p class="p">In the present study, the overall climate change mitigation effect attributable to HWPs in each region of Japan was clarified, and future projected changes until 2050 were explored. A major issue for the future entails the integrated investigation of the carbon balance of HWPs and forests and relevant changes, together with a consideration of their trade-off relationships [
