<p class="p">Considering the carbon storage effect of HWPs derived from domestic forests according to the production approach, under the future scenarios of conservation of domestic forest resources and of business as usual as regards and HWP usage, the carbon storage effect will not be obtained over the span of time until 2050. However, under the future scenarios whereby domestic roundwood production and HWP usage is promoted, the carbon storage effect is consistently expected up until 2050, with an anticipated nationwide maximum of 2.9 MtC year
