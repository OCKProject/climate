<p class="p">For the material substitution effect for building construction, civil engineering, and furniture production, the volume of the life-cycle reduction in carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption attributable to the substitution of HWPs for non-wooden materials was evaluated. However, it is necessary to determine a figure for the volume of HWP substitution for non-wooden materials. Thus, the BAU scenario was taken as a baseline, and the increase in HWP volumes in the Mod and the Agg scenarios as compared to the BAU scenario were taken to be the volume of substitution for non-wooden materials. For building construction, civil engineering, and furniture production, the annual carbon emissions reduction (tC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) attributable to material substitution was evaluated by multiplying, respectively, the increase in the floor area of new wooden building construction (m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and the increase in the consumption of each HWP (m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), by the carbon emissions reduction intensity (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>). The carbon emissions reduction intensities are shown in Table
