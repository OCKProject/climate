<p class="p">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, the carbon emissions reduction intensity attributable to the substitution of wooden building for non-wooden building (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) was taken from MiLCA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. It was calculated by subtracting the emission intensity for wooden building (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) from the emission intensity for non-wooden building (reinforced concrete, steel reinforced concrete, steel and concrete blocks) (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), from the weighted average, based on 2013 building construction floor space (m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The emission reduction intensity attributable to the substitution of wooden piles for non-wooden piles in civil engineering was taken from [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The emission intensity for wooden piles (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) was subtracted from the average value (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) of the emission intensity per unit of improved area for cement and sand piles, to generate an emission reduction intensity per unit of HWP-use volume (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>). The emission reduction intensity attributable to the substitution of wooden guardrails for metal guardrails in civil engineering was taken from [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. The emission intensity for wooden guardrails (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was subtracted from the emission intensity for metal guardrails (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), to give a reduction intensity per unit of HWP-use volume (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>). The reduction intensity attributable to the substitution of metal furniture with wooden furniture was taken from MiLCA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. The emission intensity for wooden furniture (kgC item
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was subtracted from the emission intensity for metal furniture (kgC item
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), to generate a reduction intensity per unit of HWP-use volume (kgC m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>).
