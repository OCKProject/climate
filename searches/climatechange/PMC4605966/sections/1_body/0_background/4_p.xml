<p class="p">Looking specifically at Japan, Tsunetsugu and Tonosaki [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>], and Hashimoto and Moriguchi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] have estimated the climate change mitigation effect, and carbon balance relating to HWPs for the entire country from a macro viewpoint. Meanwhile, the authors of this study have conducted research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] (hereinafter “previous report”) focusing on carbon flow as HWPs circulate between the regions of Japan and on how carbon storage is distributed among the regions. In the previous report, we divided the country into east, central, and west Japan, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, and constructed a carbon balance estimation model (hereinafter “previous model”) that takes into account the flow of HWPs between these regions. In addition, we estimated the carbon balance in each region until 2050 based on future scenarios. Clarification of the carbon balance in a region and its potential future changes allow policymakers to engage in a more practical discussion of measures for climate change mitigation using HWPs that take into account the characteristics of each region and related problems (such as carbon emissions arising from HWP transportation between regions and distribution of carbon storage volume in each region) rather than solely pursuing a macro view of the issue in Japan.
