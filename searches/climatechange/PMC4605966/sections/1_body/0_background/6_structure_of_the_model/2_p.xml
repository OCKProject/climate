<p class="p">Because the volume of Japanese HWP imports is very large (71 % of the volume of the overall HWP supply in 2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], the model targets not only domestically produced HWPs but also imported HWPs. However, when assessing carbon balance, the carbon storage in HWP derived from only domestic forests (excluding imports) and its future changes, are estimated using the production approach. The volume of Japanese HWP exports has remained below 3 % of the volume of overall HWP demand for more than 50 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], and the export volume for each application has been unclear. According to the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol of the IPCC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], the annual change in carbon storage in HWPs is assumed to be zero (instantaneous oxidation) when transparent and verifiable activity data are not available. Therefore, HWP exports were not taken into consideration.
