<p class="p">There were two significant problems in our previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. First, despite the importance of the carbon storage volume of domestically produced HWPs from a countryâ€™s forests (namely the production approach) to the UNFCCC, our previous model could not indicate the detail of HWPs produced from domestic forests, and therefore an adequate assessment of the carbon storage volume and future changes relating to HWPs derived from domestic production in each region was not possible. Second, for the climate change mitigation effect, only the carbon storage effect and energy substitution effect were targeted, and it was not feasible to address the overall mitigation effect that takes into account the material substitution effect.
