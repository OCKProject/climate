<p class="p">IPCC and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have been discussing various methods of calculating the carbon balance of HWPs, including the IPCC default approach, the stock change approach, the atmospheric flow approach, the stock change approach domestic use, and the production approach [

As a result of these discussions, since the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., since 2013), the change in the carbon storage volume of HWPs has been included in the calculation of each country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks. A modified production approach has been adopted to calculate GHG emissions and sinks, which solely includes the change in the carbon storage volume of domestically produced wood from a country’s forests (including wood exported to other countries), as stipulated in Article 3, Paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol [
