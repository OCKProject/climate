<p class="p">Because the decline of the forestry and wood industries in Japan is currently an issue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>], it is imperative to promote the use of HWPs derived from domestic forests to contribute toward revitalizing these industries. Therefore, the aggressive usage scenarios have the potential to produce the combined effect of both revitalizing the domestic forestry and wood industries and achieving carbon emissions reduction related to HWPs. On the other hand, the volume of the usage of HWP derived from domestic forests has a trade-off relationship with the volume of carbon storage in domestic forests [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. According to the results estimated from a carbon balance model for Japanese forests (including both vegetation and soil) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], carbon removals (annual changes in carbon storage) by domestic forests declined from around 20 MtC year

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2050 under these aggressive usage scenarios, and mostly compensate for the decrease in domestic forests. An important future consideration is an integrated investigation of the carbon balance for both HWPs and forests [
