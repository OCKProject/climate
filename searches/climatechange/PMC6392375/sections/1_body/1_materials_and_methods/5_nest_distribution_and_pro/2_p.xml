<p class="p">Beach patrols were conducted from 1 April to 15 October 2011–2015 at Bahía de Jiquilisco and 1 May to 15 October 2010–2015 at Estero Padre Ramos. Project personnel and a network of &gt;200 trained local egg collectors monitored nesting habitat continually from 18:00 to 06:00 daily by foot and boat in search of female hawksbills (~50% detection) and nests at both sites. Because of depressed socioeconomic conditions of coastal communities in both countries, local residents consider hawksbill eggs an economic resource, resulting in collection of nearly 100% of eggs (Liles et al.,

Consequently, conservation organizations purchase eggs encountered and/or collected by local residents for protection to prevent their sale for human consumption. Each nesting season ~10% of hawksbill clutches typically are protected in situ via agreements with local residents to leave eggs in place, and ~90% of clutches are relocated to nearby areas of the beach or to hatcheries to avoid human depredation (Liles et al.,
