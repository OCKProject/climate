<p class="p">The protection strategy employed for encountered nests depended on the likelihood of predation at the original site of egg deposition, the location of the nest, and the year at each site. At Bahía de Jiquilisco during 2011–2015, clutches deposited at the in situ protection area were not manipulated; however, we buried a surface‐enclosed wire mesh cylinder (diameter, 50 cm; height, 60 cm) around each clutch at a depth of ~55 cm after oviposition had completed to reduce the probability of egg predation; we removed this barrier three days prior to the estimated date of hatching or when a depression in the sand was observed. Clutches deposited at beaches ≤3 km from the in situ protection area were relocated to the in situ protection area for protection, except during 2013–2015, when clutches were relocated to a hatchery. We relocated remaining clutches to the nearest hatchery, depending on the location of deposition (Table

 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), except during 2010 and 2011, when some clutches were relocated to an area of beach near the hatchery because the hatchery had reached capacity or was not yet operational.
