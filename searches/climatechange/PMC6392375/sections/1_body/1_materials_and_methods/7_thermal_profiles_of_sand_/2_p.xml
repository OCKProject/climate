<p class="p">To measure intrabeach variation in temperature during the hawksbill nesting season, we divided the beach into four zones from ocean to forest, based on vegetative cover: (a) open sand (no vegetation), (b) nonwoody vegetation (herbaceous vegetation), (c) woody vegetation border (near the forest or plantations, but not completely surrounded by trees), and (d) woody vegetation (surrounded by trees; Liles, Peterson, Seminoff, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>). We buried HOBO U22 data loggers (Water Temp Pro v2, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) in each of the four beach zones at two sand depths (30 and 60 cm), which are near the upper and lower range of hawksbill nest depths, respectively (Kamel &amp; Mrosovsky, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006a</xref>). At Bahía de Jiquilisco during 2012–2015, data loggers (hereafter referred to as “loggers”) were buried in beach zones along three transects, each separated by 500 m. Not all beach zones were present along each transect, which resulted in one or two paired‐logger sites per zone per year. At Estero Padre Ramos during 2015, loggers were buried in four beach zones (

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006a</xref>), we placed loggers in areas cleared of vegetation at Bahía de Jiquilisco in 2012–2015 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3 paired‐logger sites per year) and at Estero Padre Ramos in 2015 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1 paired‐logger site). Loggers had an accuracy of ±0.2°C (per manufacturer specifications) and recorded the temperature every 30 min. We averaged recorded values to give a mean daily temperature for each logger, which facilitated comparisons with previous studies (e.g., Glen &amp; Mrosovsky,

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Loggers that were stolen (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4 at Estero Padre Ramos), lost due to beach erosion (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4 at Bahía de Jiquilisco), or did not function properly during data collection (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4 at Bahía de Jiquilisco) were excluded from analyses. The stolen loggers at Estero Padre Ramos resulted in loss of temperature data for the open sand zone and deforested area.
