<p class="p">To measure temperature in hawksbill nests during the incubation period, we placed HOBO U22 or HOBO U23 (Pro v2 Temperature/Relative Humidity, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) loggers in the center of the egg mass of clutches incubated in situ, relocated on the beach, and in hatcheries at Bahía de Jiquilisco during 2011–2015 and Estero Padre Ramos during 2012–2015. Deployment of loggers was spread across the nesting season to represent the temporal distribution of nests (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2 to 14 nests per month per site). Loggers recorded the temperature at 2.5‐min or at 5‐min intervals, depending on the logger model, and remained in the nest during the entire incubation period until they were removed at post‐hatching nest excavation. We calculated daily mean temperature for each logger, which was then used to calculate the mean nest temperature during the entire incubation period and the mean nest temperature for the middle third of incubation when offspring sex is determined (i.e., thermosensitive period; Rimblot, Fretey, Mrosovsky, Lescure, &amp; Pieau,
