<p class="p">To protect hawksbill clutches deposited on beaches where in situ protection and relocation on the beach were infeasible, shaded hatcheries were constructed at nesting beaches at both sites that typically operated from 1 May to 31 October annually and whose dimensions varied according to the capacity required for relocated clutches (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We buried loggers in the center of each hatchery at the two depths at Bahía de Jiquilisco in 2012–2015 (

 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Temperature was recorded every 30 min and then averaged to obtain a mean daily temperature for each logger. Loggers that malfunctioned during data collection (
