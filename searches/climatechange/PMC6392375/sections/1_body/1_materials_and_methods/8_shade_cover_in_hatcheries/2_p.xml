<p class="p">At Bahía de Jiquilisco (2011–2015) and Estero Padre Ramos (2010–2015), we shaded nests in hatcheries using a variety of methods that included palm leaves, shade cloth (Bahía de Jiquilisco: Saran Verde, Freund, San Salvador, El Salvador, 75% radiation block; Estero Padre Ramos: undetermined model, 75% radiation block), and natural forest canopy (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Shade cover from palm leaves and forest canopy over hatcheries was measured using a convex spherical densitometer (Ben Meadows, Janesville, WI, USA), except at Punta San Juan hatchery at Bahía de Jiquilisco in 2011 and Estero Padre Ramos in 2010–2011 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), where palm leaf cover above nests was estimated and complete forest cover over the hatchery effectively represented 100% shading, respectively. The same shade cover value was used for a hatchery across years when it remained in same location as the previous year and no changes were made to the forest canopy nor the shade cloth.
