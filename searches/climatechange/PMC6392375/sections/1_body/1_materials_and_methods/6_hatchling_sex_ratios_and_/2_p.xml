<p class="p">Although direct methods for estimating hatchling sex ratios, such as histological evaluation of gonads, are highly accurate for sexing individual hatchlings, they are logistically infeasible to perform on endangered species. Indirect methods—including nest temperature and incubation duration—are reliable proxies when direct methods are infeasible (Wibbels, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Because financial and logistical constraints prohibited us from recording nest temperatures at Estero Padre Ramos in 2010–2011, we used incubation duration values obtained for offspring‐producing nests to estimate primary sex ratios at both sites to provide results that are commensurable across sites and among years.
