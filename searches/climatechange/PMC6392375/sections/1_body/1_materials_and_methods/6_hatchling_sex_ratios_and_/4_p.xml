<p class="p">Hawksbill nests at Bahía de Jiquilisco and Estero Padre Ramos hatch about 55–70 days after egg deposition. For clutches protected during the nesting season, successful nests were excavated within 48 hr of first hatchling emergence to evaluate hatching success and failed nests were excavated on day 70 of incubation to identify potential causes of nest failure. We recorded the following metrics for reproductive output and hatchling physical condition for each clutch: size (i.e., total number of eggs), hatching success (i.e., proportion of eggs that produced live hatchlings that emerged or were found in the nest during exhumation), and straight carapace length of hatchlings measured with calipers (Bahía de Jiquilisco, Neiko Tools, Taiwan; Estero Padre Ramos, Wilmar Corp, Tukwila, WA, USA) and hatchling mass using a digital scale (Bahía de Jiquilisco, American Weigh Scales, Norcross, GA, USA) and a spring scale (Estero Padre Ramos, Wilmar Corp, Tukwila, WA, USA).</p>
