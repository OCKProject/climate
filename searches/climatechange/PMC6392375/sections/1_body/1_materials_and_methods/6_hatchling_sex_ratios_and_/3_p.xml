<p class="p">We used published data for hawksbills that related incubation duration to sex ratio based on constant temperature incubator experiments to convert the incubation duration of each clutch into hatchling sex ratio (Godfrey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). For incubation duration calculations, the incubation period was calculated as the number of days between the date and hour of clutch deposition and the date and hour of first hatchling emergence. For nests where the date of emergence was unavailable (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 50 nests, 2.5% of total) or where no hatchlings emerged but were found alive during exhumation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30 nests, 1.5% of total), we used the average incubation duration of the nest protected using the same strategy immediately before and after the nest without date of emergence or with live hatchlings that did not emerge. We used a one‐ to four‐day correction factor for the hatching‐to‐emergence interval in overall hatchling sex ratio calculations to establish a range of mean values that accounts for potential differences in the amount of time it takes a hatchling to emerge from the nest after hatching, which would affect incubation duration estimates (Godfrey et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). We calculated the overall sex ratio for each protection strategy within and across sites, and among years, and for specific comparisons among nest protection strategies and between sites, we used a three‐day correction factor based on nests that showed a marked temperature signal at hatching (mean = 2.9 ± 0.2 days,
