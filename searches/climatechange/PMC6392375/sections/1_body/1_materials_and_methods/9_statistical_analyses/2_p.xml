 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) method to convert incubation duration of hawksbill clutches protected at our sites into hatchling sex ratios. Two‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences among the three nest protection strategies in each of 10 parameters of incubation regime (i.e., nest temperature—minimum, maximum, mean of entire period, mean of thermosensitive period—during incubation, incubation duration, and nest depth) and hatchling condition (i.e., hatching success, offspring sex ratios, hatchling mass, and hatchling length) at Bahía de Jiquilisco and Estero Padre Ramos, and among years. We also used a two‐way ANOVA to test for differences in sand temperature within and among the six nest environments between logger depths and years at Bahía de Jiquilisco and within and among the four nest environments between logger depths at Estero Padre Ramos. For summary statistics, values are expressed as mean ±
