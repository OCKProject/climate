<p class="p">In this study, we investigated whether behavioral plasticity in this species is likely to be able to compensate for projected climate change and what the role of egg relocation may be as a mitigation strategy. The objectives of our study were to (a) estimate sex ratios and physical condition of hatchling hawksbills under natural and manipulated conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and (b) generate and analyze thermal profiles of nest environments. Our results provide the first empirical assessment of the efficacy of nest protection strategies for this severely depleted RMU. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for mitigation strategies that complement potential plastic adaptive responses to climate change demonstrated by nesting hawksbills in mangrove ecosystems.
