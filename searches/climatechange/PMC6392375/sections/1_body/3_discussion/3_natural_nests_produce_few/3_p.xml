<p class="p">We found significantly lower hatching success in clutches protected in situ (43.6%) than clutches relocated on the beach (46.2%) or in hatcheries (58.6%) at both sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). This difference probably arises primarily from differences in microenvironmental conditions during incubation (Eckert &amp; Eckert,

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), such as the amount of organic content (e.g., roots and leaves) in the sand, which is likely lower in hatcheries due to removal of organic material during hatchery preparation. This is consistent with hawksbill clutches in Antigua (Caribbean), where hatching success increased as a function of decreasing organic content in the sand (Ditmer &amp; Stapleton, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Hatchery preparation processes could further favorably alter conditions of nest environments by lowering sand compaction within the hatchery enclosure, which could facilitate respiratory gas exchange of developing embryos (Garrett, Wallace, Garner, &amp; Paladino,
