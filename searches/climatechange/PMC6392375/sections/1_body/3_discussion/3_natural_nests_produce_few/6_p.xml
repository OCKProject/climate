<p class="p">It is unclear, however, whether increased carapace size and locomotor performance in hatchlings at open‐coast beaches confer similar advantages to hatchlings at inshore beaches in mangrove estuaries. Ongoing research into dispersal patterns of hawksbill hatchlings in Bahía de Jiquilisco suggests that hatchling movements are regulated by tidal currents in the estuary, where turtles tend to passively drift camouflaged among floating debris (e.g., mangrove shoots and leaves) while transported by tidal currents (M. Liles, unpublished data). This behavior suggests that smaller hatchlings from warmer in situ nests may not necessarily be at a comparative disadvantage to larger hatchlings from clutches relocated on the beach and in hatcheries while inside mangrove estuaries, but could be at a disadvantage if transported outside the estuary and thence required to actively swim to encounter ocean currents.</p>
