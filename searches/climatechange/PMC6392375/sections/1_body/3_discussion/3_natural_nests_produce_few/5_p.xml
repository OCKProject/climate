<p class="p">Hatchling length and mass differed among nest protection strategies and among years (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), with hatchlings that were smaller and weighed less from clutches protected in situ than clutches relocated on the beach or in hatcheries (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Previous studies indicate that nest temperature is inversely correlated with hatchling body size, where warmer nests produce hatchlings with smaller carapaces and flippers, but that nest temperature did not influence hatchling mass (Booth, Feeney, &amp; Shibata, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Maulany, Booth, &amp; Baxter, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Wood, Booth, &amp; Limpus, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0123" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Hatchlings with larger carapaces and flippers are likely to crawl faster and employ more thrust while swimming than smaller hatchlings (Ischer, Ireland, &amp; Booth, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Janzen, Tucker, &amp; Paukstis, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), which may allow them to more quickly navigate away from near‚Äêshore predators to offshore waters and thus increase their chance of survival (Booth, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wood et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0123" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
