<p class="p">We estimate that hawksbill nesting beaches produced 66.0%–81.0% female hatchlings across nest protection strategies at our sites, with a slightly higher percentage of females produced at Bahía de Jiquilisco than Estero Padre Ramos (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Our results represent lower female‐biased sex ratios than reported at many sea turtle nesting beaches in other ocean basins (Hawkes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Poloczanska, Limpus, &amp; Hays, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wibbels, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), but female production was more pronounced in clutches protected in situ, with 88.9%–96.2% and 68.1%–88.3% females at Bahía de Jiquilisco and Estero Padre Ramos, respectively. Clutches relocated to hatcheries at Estero Padre Ramos experienced a significant shift in sex ratios from highly male‐biased in 2010–2011 to highly female‐biased in 2012–2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). This shift is likely due to a change in hatchery location from a site with 100% overstory vegetation cover to an area with less cover (77.7%; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), combined with climatic factors—such as cooler ambient temperature and increased precipitation associated with La Niña—reflected by longer incubation durations across protection strategies at Estero Padre Ramos. We attribute the higher percentage of female hatchlings produced at Bahía de Jiquilisco primarily to the degraded condition of coastal forest at many beaches relative to the higher‐quality habitat that is available to nesting turtles at Estero Padre Ramos (Liles, Peterson, Seminoff, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>), including areas where clutches are protected in situ. Indeed, vegetation cover can predict nest temperatures (Kamel, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and hatchling sex (Janzen, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), which highlights the importance of preserving and restoring natural vegetation cover at hawksbill nesting beaches.
