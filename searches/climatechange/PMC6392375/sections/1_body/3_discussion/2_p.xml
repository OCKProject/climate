<p class="p">Uncertainty exists regarding the ability of long‐lived thermally sensitive reptiles, such as sea turtles, to exhibit compensatory responses to accelerated climate‐driven environmental changes capable of offsetting negative consequences to population demographics (Hays, Mazaris, Schofield, &amp; Laloë,

For eastern Pacific hawksbills nesting in mangrove estuaries at Bahía de Jiquilisco, El Salvador, and Estero Padre Ramos, Nicaragua, our results demonstrate that clutches protected in situ incubated at higher temperatures, yielded lower hatching success, produced a higher percentage of female hatchlings, and produced less fit offspring than clutches relocated to hatcheries. Additionally, sand temperature data of nesting beaches indicate that most nest environments already surpass the pivotal temperature for hawksbills, with higher temperatures at the deeper depth in the coolest nest environments (i.e., woody vegetation and hatchery).
