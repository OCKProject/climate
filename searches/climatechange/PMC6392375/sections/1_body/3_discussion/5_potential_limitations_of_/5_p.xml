<p class="p">Shifts in nesting phenology have been observed for some sea turtle populations (Azanza‐Ricardo et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Because sand temperatures at Bahía de Jiquilisco and Estero Padre Ramos generally decreased over the nesting season in all nest environments at both depths (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a–d), the decrease in temperature between the beginning (April–May) and end (September–October) of the nesting season—which is reflected in shorter incubation durations and higher percentage of female hatchlings produced during the first half than the second half of the nesting season (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a,b)—suggests that hawksbills could respond to projected temperature increases by nesting later in the season to exploit cooler temperatures. Additionally, turtles that currently nest in September–October at both sites may have an adaptive advantage (Valladares et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), highlighting the importance of protecting the nests of these individuals, even if their numbers are relatively fewer during those later months.
