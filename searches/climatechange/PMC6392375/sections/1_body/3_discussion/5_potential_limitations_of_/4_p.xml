<p class="p">Strategies to mitigate beach loss from climate change include enforcement of existing construction setback regulations and prevention of coastal infrastructure that alter nesting areas (Fuentes, Fish, &amp; Maynard, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although conservation setbacks can be an important tool for maintaining nesting beach integrity (e.g., Fish et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), and despite nominal protective measures that prohibit human use of beaches 100 m landward from the high tide line in Nicaragua (República de Nicaragua, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), most beaches at our sites are backed by human settlements, small‐scale agriculture, or mangrove forests in the intertidal zone, which can restrict inland retreat of beaches. While the paleoenvironmental record indicates that mangroves have adjusted to sea‐level changes over millennia through vertical sediment accretion and subsurface root accumulation (Ellison, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Woodroffe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), the current rate of sea‐level rise likely will outpace gain in soil surface elevation, and in areas where physical barriers (e.g., aquaculture ponds, coastal infrastructure, and agricultural fields) prevent landward migration, such as at our sites, mangroves may submerge (Lovelock et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Given that 90% (

 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), highly specific biophysical (e.g., sand morphology and ocean currents) and human‐induced (e.g., depredation and beach development) conditions govern viability of these areas as suitable nesting habitat, suggesting that latitudinal redistribution to exploit other Central American beaches where similar climatic patterns are projected to occur seems unlikely (Saba et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Santidrián Tomillo et al.,
