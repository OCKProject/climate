<p class="p">The ability of egg‐burying species to alter nest depth to compensate for increasing temperatures has been advanced as a possible adaptive strategy, presumably under the basic assumption that nest environments become cooler with increasing depth (Davenport, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>; Fuentes &amp; Porter, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our results, however, indicate that adjustment of nest depth by hawksbills is unlikely to compensate for climate change in mangrove estuaries. First, we detected higher temperatures at the deeper depth in most nest environments at both sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e,f). Second, the water table is at a depth of 50–85 cm during the nesting season at many beaches, which can be expected to become shallower as sea levels rise and further constrict suitable nest environments (Pike, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This likely explains, at least in part, why hawksbills construct shallower nest cavities at Bahía de Jiquilisco (38.2 cm) and Estero Padre Ramos (40.5 cm) than at open‐coast nesting locations in the Caribbean (e.g., 47.0 cm, Kamel &amp; Mrosovsky, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006a</xref>), Indo‐Pacific (e.g., 45.3 cm, Loop et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), and Indian Ocean (e.g., 46.5 cm, Hitchins, Bourquin, Hitchins, &amp; Piper, 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Finally, male hatchling production at Bahía de Jiquilisco and Estero Padre Ramos is not correlated with nest depth for clutches protected in situ, suggesting that shifts in nesting phenology and nest‐site choice may be more effective adaptive responses to a warming climate.
