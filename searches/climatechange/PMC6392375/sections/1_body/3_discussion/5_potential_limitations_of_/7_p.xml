<p class="p">However, mangrove ecosystems are among the most threatened tropical environments in the world, with deforestation rates as high as 3.6% per year in the Americas (Valiela, Bowen, &amp; York,

Coastal forests at our sites are confronted with the persistent threat of conversion by competing land uses, and forests along nesting beaches at Bahía de Jiquilisco have already experienced substantial alteration that restricts nest‐site selection by hawksbills (Liles, Peterson, Seminoff, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>). Our findings suggest that inability to halt the continued fragmentation of intact woody vegetation will progressively replace cooler male hatchling producing refugia (28.5°C) for naturally incubating clutches with markedly warmer woody vegetation border (30.2°C) and deforested (31.9°C) areas, increasing the probability of highly female‐biased sex ratios (Poloczanska et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34774-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and ultimately, climate‐driven egg and hatchling mortality (Santidrián Tomillo et al.,
