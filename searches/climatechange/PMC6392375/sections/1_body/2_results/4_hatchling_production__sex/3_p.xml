<p class="p">The overall range of means for the percentage of female hatchlings produced from protected clutches was 66.0 ± 37.6 to 81.0 ± 37.6% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1,845), with a greater percentage of female hatchling production from clutches protected in situ (86.9 ± 20.1%, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 135) than those relocated on the beach (63.2 ± 35.2%, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 102) and in hatcheries (76.4 ± 34.4%, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1608). Of the hatchlings produced at both sites, there was a higher percentage of females at Bahía de Jiquilisco than Estero Padre Ramos (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with significant differences among protection strategies and years at both sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). No correlation existed between male hatchling production and nest depth for clutches protected in situ (
