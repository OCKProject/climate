<p class="p">Overall, mean nest temperature during the entire incubation period was 30.4 ± 1.1°C (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 274 clutches), with slightly higher temperatures in clutches protected in situ (30.7 ± 1.0°C, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 44) than clutches relocated to hatcheries (30.3 ± 1.1°C, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 218). Mean nest temperature during the middle third of the incubation period was likewise higher in clutches protected in situ (30.6 ± 1.3°C, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 44) than clutches relocated to hatcheries (29.9 ± 1.1°C, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 218; overall, 30.1 ± 1.2°C, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 276). There was little difference in nest temperature between sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), but significant differences among nest protection strategies at both sites (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34774-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
