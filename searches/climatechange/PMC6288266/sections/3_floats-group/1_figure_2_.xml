   <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huey and Kingsolver 1989</xref>). The temperature optimum is the temperature at which performance reaches its maximal level or peak performance. The performance breadth defines how steeply peaked (stenothermal) or broadly plateaued (eurythermal) the response curve is. Any part or the whole of such a curve can be considered to be a reaction norm of a genotype representing a range of phenotypes expressed across an environmental gradient, in this example, of temperature.
