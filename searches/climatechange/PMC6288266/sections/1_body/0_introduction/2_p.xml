<p class="p">Carbon dioxide emissions from soils are mediated predominately by microbial metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>), which, when not constrained by moisture availability, is a function of temperature (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schlesinger 1977</xref>). There is thus the potential for increased soil temperatures to accelerate emissions of carbon dioxide from soils. The further accumulation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the atmosphere could then lead to further increases in temperature, leading to a positive feedback (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>) (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thakur et al. 2018</xref>). This process is of most concern in regions with the highest pools of soil organic matter, such as tundra regions and temperate grasslands (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Melillo et al. 2017</xref>). However, recent evidence indicates current carbon stores in other soils may also be changing from sinks to sources (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carrera et al. 2011</xref>) due to greater increases in soil respiration than in rates of carbon input to the soils.
