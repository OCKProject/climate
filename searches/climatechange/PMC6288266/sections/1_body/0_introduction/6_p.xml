<p class="p">Traits of many soil animals are sensitive to relative humidity, making the soil fauna vulnerable to their activities being curtailed by changes in soil moisture (

Isopods are the most successful group of crustaceans to have made the transition to the terrestrial environment in terms of their abundance, distribution, and diversity, and have colonised a wide range of terrestrial habitats from the littoral zone to deserts (

Isopods therefore form good model soil animals for testing hypotheses concerning how inter-specific differences in their physiological, behavioural and life history traits will lead to interspecific differences in responses to predicted future changes in climate.
