<p class="p">In this review we examine the extent to which traits of different species of terrestrial isopods known to have different strategies for reducing water loss in the terrestrial environment, respond to temperature and relative humidity. Phenotypic responses to a gradient in the environment can be summarised as norms of reaction. A reaction norm is the set of phenotypes produced in a range of environments (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, denote how quickly an organism changes its performance for a given change in an environmental gradient. A steep gradient indicates a strong response and a high level of phenotypic plasticity over that region of the environmental gradient. Reaction norms can be very effective in comparing responses not just between different species as has been demonstrated very clearly by
