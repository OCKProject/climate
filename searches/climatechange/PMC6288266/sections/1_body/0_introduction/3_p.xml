<p class="p">The possible consequences of this positive feedback cycle could potentially be reduced if soil moisture were to decrease as a result of changes in rainfall patterns (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). Climate models predict that globally rainfall will increase but it is predicted to vary strongly both spatially and temporally. Spatially, greater increases are projected for high latitudes and mid-latitude wet regions but decreases in subtropical dry regions and many mid-latitude regions (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC 2013</xref>). Temporally, summer rainfall in temperate regions, such as west and south Europe, is predicted to occur in fewer, but more intense episodes. These will result in longer periods of summer drought which could potentially constrain temperature-induced increases in soil carbon fluxes, including by reducing the stimulation of microbial metabolism by moisture dependent soil animals.
