<p class="p">We investigated differences in reaction norms of physiological, behavioural, and life history traits in response to differences in temperature and relative humidity for a range of isopod species chosen to reflect differences in their eco-morphology (

We used the selected species to explore possible implications of inter-specific differences in responses to micro-climate for the role of soil animals in soil processes, including regulation of microbially mediated soil carbon dynamics (
