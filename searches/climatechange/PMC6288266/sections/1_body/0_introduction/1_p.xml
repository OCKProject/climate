<p class="p">In this review we draw attention to an important contribution that soil biologists, in particular those who study the biology of terrestrial isopods, can potentially make to the current debate as to how global climate change may influence components of the global carbon cycle. Currently the greatest uncertainty in modelling the global carbon cycle is not the fluxes across the ocean atmosphere interface or fluxes relating to net primary production but in modelling carbon fluxes within the soil. Globally ten times more carbon dioxide is emitted from soils than from all anthropogenic sources combined (

A major challenge of current ecological research is to determine how ecosystem processes will respond to future environmental conditions (Santotja et al. 2017). It is widely acknowledged that food webs play pivotal roles in carbon cycles, including emissions of carbon dioxide from soils under climate change but this is rarely considered in modelling carbon fluxes (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pelini et al. 2015</xref>), while understanding of organismic physiological responses under climate change remains very rudimentary (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmitz 2013</xref>). One question that is currently being debated is the extent to which soil animals can be modelled grouped together in broad trophic categories or whether they need to be considered at a finer level of functional trait or taxonomic resolution, depending upon their individual responses to changes in micro-climate (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dixie et al. 2015</xref>). Terrestrial isopods potentially form a useful model system with which to address this question because their behaviour, physiology, and life histories have been so extensively studied.
