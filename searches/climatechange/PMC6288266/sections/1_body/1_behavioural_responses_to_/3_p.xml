 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3a, d</xref>) resembles the theoretical one in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref> in being an upwardly convex curve, with a peak in the aggregation index of 2.93 at 19 °C, a performance breadth at 90% of the peak of 4.7 °C and a gradient of the reaction norm from 14 °C to 17 °C of + 0.8 increase in aggregation index for this 3 °C rise in temperature. At temperatures higher than 19 °C the curve of the aggregation index decreases due to more of the animals leaving the clumps and moving around the arena sometimes climbing up the walls in an attempt to escape to find more favourable lower temperatures (
