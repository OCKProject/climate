 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dias et al. 2012</xref>). The experimental mesocosms (220mm × 150mm × 80mm deep) were lined with plaster of Paris covered by 50mm sand with a feeding tray at one end and a shelter at the other, as described in further detail by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moss (2007)</xref>. Two simulated rainfall regimes were used: high simulated rainfall, representing current mean summer daily rainfall intensity of 1.65 mm day

 </named-content>) during 1996–2006 when rainfall events occurred on average once every 72h. The low simulated rainfall regime was half the intensity of the high rainfall regime, 0.83 mm day
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, representing a scenario with 810 ppm concentration of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by 2080 which is predicted to result in a 50% reduction in summer rainfall in south west England (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hulme et al. 2002</xref>). For both regimes the simulated rainfall was administered at the start of each 72h period using a seedling watering can with 0.6 mm diameter holes in the rose with the shelter and food trays temporarily covered. Replicate arenas but without animals were used to monitor percentage moisture content of the substrate by taking samples of sand each morning and evening. Differences in the moisture conditions in the mesocosms were caused by both differences in intensity of simulated rainfall and the progressive drying out of mesocosms which occurred with time between rainfall events. Starting moisture level following high rainfall level ≈ 20% and for low rainfall level ≈ 10%.
