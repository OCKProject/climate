<p class="p">Eight replicate mesocosms were used for each rainfall treatment, with six identical control boxes for monitoring substrate moisture content. Each mesocosm contained twenty individuals of each species. The behaviours of all animals over a 72-hour period were classified according to their location in the mesocosm and activity categories, including sheltering and presence in the feeding area. It was not possible to observe movements of mouthparts so time spent in the feeding area was assumed to be proportional to time spent feeding (
