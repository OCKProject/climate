<p class="p">Many terrestrial isopods aggregate in shelter sites, particularly during the day, often under stones or pieces of wood where moisture from the soil maintains a more favourable relative humidity than in more open sites. They then emerge to forage at night when temperatures are lower and relative humidity is higher. Sheltering behaviour is thus of central importance in reducing mortality due to desiccation while also reducing the risk of being eaten by diurnal predators, such as insectivorous birds.</p>
