All four of the moisture reaction norms for a 20% decrease in moisture are steeper than any of the thermal reaction norms for a 5 °C temperature difference for either species. This indicates a greater sensitivity to a 20% change in relative humidity than to a rise of 5 °C in temperature, suggesting that perhaps these species might respond more to predicted future changes in rainfall than to predicted increases in temperature. The difference in gradients of reaction norms between species (Table
