<p class="p">One of the drivers of differences between species of isopods in their behavioural and life history responses to differences in temperature and moisture is their different physiological adaptations to the terrestrial environment. In this section we compare responses of terrestrial isopod species, occurring in a wide range of biomes representing a gradient of moisture conditions.</p>
