<p class="p">Terrestrial isopods are soil animals about which we have a wealth of knowledge based on empirical studies on their anatomy, behaviour, physiology, life history, and ecology. What we do not have is integrative models of different aspects of their biology that can then be interfaced with those of other soil animals and ultimately with those of micro-organisms. This integrative approach would significantly contribute to our understanding of how global climate change will affect the soil component of the global carbon cycle.</p>
