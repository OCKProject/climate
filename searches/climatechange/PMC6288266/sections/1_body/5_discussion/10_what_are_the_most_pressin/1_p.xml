<p class="p">Our understanding of the global carbon cycle is predominantly encapsulated in models. Our understanding of terrestrial isopod biology, in contrast, is mostly based on results of empirical studies. There is a very important need to bridge the gap between these two contrasting approaches and methodologies in these completely different disciplines. Considering the whole series of symposium volumes on the Biology of Terrestrial Isopods from 1984 until 2018, models may qualify as an endangered species.</p>
