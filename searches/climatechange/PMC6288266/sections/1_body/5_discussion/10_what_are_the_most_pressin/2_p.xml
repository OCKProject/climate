<p class="p">We know that carbon dynamics in the soil is the least well understood part of the global carbon cycle. Whilst, it is extremely complicated, models by definition are simplifications of reality. Models can never represent the full complexity of the real world, that is not their function, but what they have are both holistic and heuristic properties. Holistic in that it should be easier to appreciate emergent properties of a system as a whole from a model of it, rather than from detailed studies of individual components. Heuristic in that models should generate testable predictions that cannot be made on the basis of studying individual components in isolation.</p>
