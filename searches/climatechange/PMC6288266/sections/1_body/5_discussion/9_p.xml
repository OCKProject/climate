 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krab et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Makkonen et al. (2011)</xref>, who found that interspecific faunal trait variation provided a valuable tool in predicting animal responses to climate change. However, it is noteworthy that 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crowther et al. (2015)</xref> conclude that the regulatory effects of interspecific interactions are rarely considered in climate feedback studies. 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pelini et al. (2015)</xref> extend this conclusion further by arguing that without isolating and including the significant impact of invertebrates, climate models will be incomplete, hindering well-informed policy decisions. Because the adaptive value of fundamental biological traits in isopods have been so comprehensively studied and because isopods form such a prominent component of so many soil macro-arthropod communities, we propose that terrestrial isopods represent excellent model systems for further investigation of species specific responses to predicted climate change and their consequences for soil carbon dynamics.
