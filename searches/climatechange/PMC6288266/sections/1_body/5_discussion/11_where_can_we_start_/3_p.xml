<p class="p">A problem will always be integrating models representing different levels of organisation which, from previous studies, range from molecules to communities. These may initially appear to be measured in different currencies but ultimately, while we are working within the paradigm of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, the answer to this problem may be in using fitness, or at least fitness correlates, to equate different traits at the individual level. Moving from the individual level to the ecosystem function level could then at least be based on a sound theoretical foundation.</p>
