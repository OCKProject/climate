<p class="p">The “functional traits” approach (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moretti et al. 2017</xref>) may be one way forward. Splitting whole trophic groups, treated as homogeneous entities in some large scale models, into functional groups has been an important step in the right direction. Taking account of interspecific differences in traits within functional groups and incorporating the diversity of responses into systems models could be a further important step. It would appear that the new generation of isopod biologists is now uniquely well placed to do this, thus giving them the potential to fill an extremely important gap in 21

We wish younger colleagues all success with such a challenging venture at such an exciting time and best wishes with carrying the science of terrestrial isopod biology to new horizons.
