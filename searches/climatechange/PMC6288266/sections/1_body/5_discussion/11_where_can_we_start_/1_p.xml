<p class="p">Models do not necessarily have to be numerical, at least initially. A topographic map is a model of a landscape. At a glance, that piece of paper only tens of cm wide, shows us where hills, mountains, rivers and bridges are in landscapes at much larger scales. By using a map we can predict how best to travel from A to B. What is very urgently needed in soil biology is some comparably simplified maps of the interactions involving the soil animals under our feet. A starting place could be for the context of many future studies to be introduced using conceptual box and arrow models of the system under study (Fig.
