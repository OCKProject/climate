<p class="p">Sheltering behaviour is another tactic evolved in isopods to help reduce water loss by taking refuge in more humid shelter sites. Again,

Thus within three species, all typical in mesic environments, there was a consistent trend in all of these behavioural traits, with species without pleopodal lungs being more sensitive to changes in microclimate than species better adapted to resist desiccation. This again indicates that there are significant inter-specific differences which suggest those species least adapted to the terrestrial environment might be more susceptible to potential changes in micro-climate resulting from changes in future patterns of rainfall.
