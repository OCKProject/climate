<p class="p">If the abundance of some species declines, it is not yet known whether other species, less sensitive to changes in microclimate, will respond by expanding their realised niches. It is known that interspecific competition for high quality foods between different species of isopods does occur in the field (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hassall and Dangerfield 1989</xref>) so it is possible that total guild densities may change less than species composition of guilds for macro-decomposers. It is known that differential impacts on basic biological parameters of individual species can modify fundamental characteristics of community structure and function (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiguet et al. 2011</xref>). For isopods it is possible that the functional role of the whole isopod guild in stimulating microbial activity may alter less as a result of future climate change than might be expected from effects on particularly sensitive individual species. If other species in the guild, less sensitive to changes in micro-climate, expanded their realised niches in response to the decline of a more sensitive species, this could buffer consequences of climate change for overall decomposition rates. It is yet to be tested whether net community level responses, resulting from differential impacts of climate change on individual species, will impact on the extent to which future changes in rainfall patterns might mitigate potential increased temperature/ induced carbon dioxide emission feedbacks. It is widely agreed however, more focus is required on biotic interactions to clarify the potential feedbacks between climate change and soil carbon dynamics (
