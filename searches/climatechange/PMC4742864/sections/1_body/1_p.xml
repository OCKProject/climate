<p class="p">Because the impacts of GHG emissions can be felt beyond a country’s border, and the impacts of climate change on countries are highly variable, there is potential for some emitters to contribute more or less to the causes of climate change than is proportionate to their vulnerability to its effects

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. As far back as 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) committed to the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, in which countries have a common responsibility in reducing GHG emissions, but historic emissions and differences in current development levels mean that countries have different levels of emissions reduction obligations

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> although operationalising the principle has proved difficult
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. This is primarily because developing and developed countries continue to disagree over the extent of each other’s responsibilities

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. One major impediment to resolving such debates is a poor quantitative understanding of the magnitude of the global inequity in emissions and impacts. ‘Free rider’ countries contribute disproportionately to global GHG emissions with only limited vulnerability to the effects of the resulting climate change, while ‘forced rider’ countries are most vulnerable to climate change but have contributed little to its genesis
