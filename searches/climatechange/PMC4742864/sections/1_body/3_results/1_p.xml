<p class="p">Greenhouse gas emissions are spread highly unevenly across the world’s countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), with the top ten GHG emitting countries generating &gt;60% of total emissions, and three countries, China (21.1%), the United States of America (14.1%) and India (5.2%) being by far the largest contributors. A Gini coefficient of 80.9 indicated extreme inequality in the distribution of emissions among countries, given that the index can only vary between 0 (perfectly even responsibility) and 100 (one country responsible for all emissions)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. A Robin Hood index of 64 indicated that 64% of GHG emissions would need to be redistributed to achieve an even distribution among countries
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Vulnerability to the impacts of climate change was also unevenly spread among countries, with 17 countries acutely vulnerable to climate change impacts in 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The majority of these were island countries located in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans (n = 7, 35.3%) and African countries (n = 8, 47%). By 2030 the number of acutely vulnerable countries is predicted to rise dramatically (n = 62;
