<p class="p">Greenhouse gas emissions were positively correlated with GDP (2010: ρ = 0.84, n = 175, p = 0; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>), while climate vulnerability declined with increasing GDP (2010: ρ = −0.69, n = 175, p = 0; 2030: ρ = −0.65, n = 175, p = 0; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2d</xref>). Our analysis considers the absolute contribution of each country to climate change, but we also examined climate change equity in per capita terms to provide a more complete picture of emissions responsibilities. The patterns were broadly similar, with, for example, Australia, Russia and the United States of America remaining free riders (see
