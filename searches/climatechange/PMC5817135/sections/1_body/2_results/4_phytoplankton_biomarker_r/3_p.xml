<p class="p">The dinosterol contents, representing dinoflagellate biomass, varied from 38.7 to 207.3 ng/g with two significant periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b): (1) 1940–1970, dinosterol contents were relative stable, averaging 52.9 ng/g; (2) 1970–2011, dinosterol contents increased gradually during 1970–1997 (RSI: 0.6 and 0.5; average: 75.6 and 93.5 ng/g) and more rapidly during 1997–2011 (RSI: 1.6 and 0.7; average: 126.6 and 162.7 ng/g). These results are consistent with the increased temperature and terrestrial input.
