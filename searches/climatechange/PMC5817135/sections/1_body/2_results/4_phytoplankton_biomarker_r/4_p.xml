<p class="p">TOC‐normalized biomarker content (e.g., nanogram of biomarker per gram of TOC in sediment) assists in evaluating the effect of variation in biomarker preservation in sediment as it can indicate the relative enrichment or depletion of any specific biomarker in comparison with the bulk TOC. The TOC‐normalized brassicasterol varied from 53.1 to 853.8 ng/g TOC with two significant periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a): (1) 1940–1997, brassicasterol contents were lower and stable, averaging 86.6 ng/g TOC; (2) 1997–2011, brassicasterol contents increased rapidly, STARS detected two significant increases (RSI: 1.0 and 2.8), and the averages during these shifts were 204.8 ng/g TOC and 554.7 ng/g TOC, respectively.
