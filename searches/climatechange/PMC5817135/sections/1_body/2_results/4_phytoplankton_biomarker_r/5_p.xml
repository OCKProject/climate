<p class="p">The TOC‐normalized dinosterol content varied from 127.4 to 729.7 ng/g TOC with two significant periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b): (1) 1940–1982, dinosterol contents were relative stable, averaging 237.8 ng/g TOC; (2) 1982–2011, dinosterol contents increased gradually during 1982–1999 (RSI: 0.8; average: 399.6 ng/g TOC) and more rapidly during 1999–2011 (RSI: 1.2 and 0.3; average: 537.1 ng/g TOC and 614.9 ng/g TOC). Thus, the temporal variations of TOC‐normalized biomarker contents were similar to those of the corresponding biomarker contents, suggesting minimal influence from variability in preservation.
