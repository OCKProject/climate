<p class="p">The brassicasterol contents of the sediment, representing diatom biomass, varied from 14.8 to 244.6 ng/g with two significant periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a): (1) 1940–1997, brassicasterol contents were lower and stable, averaging 22.2 ng/g; (2) 1997–2011, brassicasterol contents increased rapidly, STARS detected three significant increases (RSI: 1.0, 1.7, and 1.4), and the average contents during these shifts were 44.7, 103.4, and 188.8 ng/g, respectively.
