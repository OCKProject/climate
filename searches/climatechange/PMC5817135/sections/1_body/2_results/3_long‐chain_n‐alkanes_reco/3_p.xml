 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b shows Broome rainfall ranged from 132 to 1,496 mm during 1941–2011. STARS separated them into two periods with a small increasing shift in 1997 (RSI: 0.1). The average rainfall during 1997–2011 was 802.2 mm, significantly higher than the average rainfall during 1941–1996 (553.7 mm). In comparison, STARS did not detect a significant shift in annual river discharge of the Fitzroy River during 1963–2011, despite a slightly increasing trend after the 1990s (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). The average annual river discharge during 1997–2011 was 3.92 × 10

 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/year, higher than during 1963–1996 (2.53 × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/year). Thus, the patterns of long‐chain 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>‐alkanes, rainfall, and river discharge are broadly consistent in this region, indicating an increase after the late 1990s.
