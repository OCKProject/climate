<p class="p">The magnitudes of the shift changes of four biomarker proxies and observational data over time were assessed using the sequential

 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). The cutoff length (
 <italic class="italic">l</italic>) was set to 10 year and the probability level to alpha = .05, representing a significant regime shift. STARS used a 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test analysis to determine whether sequential records in a time series represent statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.05) departures from mean values observed during the preceding period of a predetermined duration (in our case, we used 10 years). After the shift point (date) was established, the magnitude change was reflected in the value of the regime shift index (RSI), which represents a cumulative sum of the normalized anomalies. The correlation between phytoplankton biomasses and environmental factors was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) using SPSS 16 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Inc.), and the eigenvalues were used to determine the fraction of total data variance explained by each principal component.
