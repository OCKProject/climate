<p class="p">Cygnet Bay has an area of approximately 150 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and an average water depth of 10 m and is located in King Sound, which is the receiving water body of the Fitzroy River catchment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). Fitzroy River is the largest river discharging into King Sound and influencing Cygnet Bay, with 7035 GL of annual discharge and almost all the discharge occurs in the austral summer (data from Western Australian Department of Water, station: Fitzroy River‐Willare). Due to the impact of the semiarid tropical climatic regime, the evaporation rate is about 3,000 mm/year, greatly exceeding the rainfall, and the annual SST ranges from 26.1 to 30.3°C. The hydrodynamic processes in King Sound are mainly controlled by tide‐driven currents, and average tidal velocities are higher than 0.2 m/s (Wolanski &amp; Spagnol,

Previous studies indicated that the environmental impact of this aquaculture activity was low due to the low stocking density and fast rate of water exchange (Jelbart, Schreider, &amp; Macfarlane,
