<p class="p">The core used for biomarker analysis was sectioned at 1‐cm intervals and freeze dried prior to biomarker analysis. Sample processing and instrumental analyses of biomarker proxies were performed at Ocean University of China, using the same methods described in Li, Zhao, Tian, and Li (
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Briefly, about 5 g of sediment was extracted four times with dichloromethane/MeOH (3:1, v/v), after adding internal standards (

Subsequently, the polar fraction was divided into two parts, one derivatized using N, O‐bis (trimethylsilyl)‐trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 70°C for 1 hr and the other filtered by PTFE membrane (0.45 μm) before instrumental measurements.
