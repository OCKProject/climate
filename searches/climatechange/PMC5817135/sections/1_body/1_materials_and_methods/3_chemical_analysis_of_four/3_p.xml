<p class="p">The long‐chain 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>‐alkanes, brassicasterol, and dinosterol were quantified by GC (Agilent 6890N) with an FID detector and a HP‐1 column (50 m × 0.32 μm × 0.17 μm). The oven temperature was programmed from 80°C for 1 min and then increased to 200°C at 25°C/min, followed by 4°C/min to 250°C, then 1.6°C/min to 300°C (holding for 12 min), 5°C/min to 320°C (holding for 5 min). GDGT analysis was performed by HPLC‐MS (Agilent 1200/Waters Micromass‐Quattro Ultima
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Pt) with APCI probe and Prevail Cyano Column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm). Separation was achieved with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 30°C using a gradient program: 88% A (hexane) and 12% B (hexane/isopropanol, v/v = 9:1) at first, a linear gradient to 14% B in 3 min and to 24% B in 6 min; 76% A and 24% B for 5 min; a linear gradient to 100% B in 2 min; 100% B for 8 min; returning to 88% A and 12% B for 13 min. The analytical accuracy was better than 10% (Relative Standard Deviation) for these lipid contents in our laboratory.
