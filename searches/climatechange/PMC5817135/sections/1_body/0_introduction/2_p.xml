<p class="p">Phytoplankton is a key component in marine ecosystems, and its variations in abundance and species composition are sensitively coupled with short‐ and long‐term environmental changes, and consequently influence the structure and function of ecosystems, for example, biogeochemical cycles and the food web (Field, Behrenfeld, Randerson, &amp; Falkowski, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Over the last several decades, phytoplankton regime shifts, for example, the changes in biomass and species composition and shifts between diatom and nondiatom communities, have been widely observed in many coastal ecosystems (Smetacek &amp; Cloern, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Most evidence demonstrated that nutrient enrichment is a principal driving factor for phytoplankton regime shifts in coastal waters (Anderson, Glibert, &amp; Burkholder, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), and ocean warming could enhance this process, affecting the distribution and productivity of phytoplankton in the ocean (Irwin, Finkel, Müller‐Karger, &amp; Troccoli, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). For example, the warmer sea surface temperature (SST) and lower turbidity in the North Sea have increased phytoplankton biomass, even though nutrient concentrations have been decreasing since the 1980s (Mcquatters‐Gollop et al.,
