<p class="p">Long‐chain

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>‐alkanes during 2002–2011 matches the increased rainfall and river discharge after 1997, although there is a small time lag (Figure

 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) found primary production increased ca. twofold in 1990–2013 compared to 1960–1962 in the Kimberley. Thus, there is credible evidence for phytoplankton biomass increase related to climate change in the Kimberley shelf region.
