<p class="p">The sediment core analysis revealed not only the increased phytoplankton biomass since 1997 but also the different shifting pattern between diatoms and dinoflagellates. Dinoflagellates showed an earlier but slower increasing trend compared to diatoms (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33836-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Thompson and Bonham (
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) analyzed the phytoplankton communities during a 2010 research voyage in the Kimberley and found the pigment proportion of diatoms in shallow water (&lt;50 m) was much higher than for dinoflagellates. This supports our result in the upper section of the core. In general, diatoms are favored in niches with higher macronutrients, higher turbulence, lower salinity, and lower temperature than the dinoflagellates, and thus, diatoms often dominate in the coastal and estuarine waters (Berdalet, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Margalef, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>). Silicate is a critical, limiting macronutrient for diatom growth but not for dinoflagellates, and the source of silicate in coastal waters is mainly through riverine input. Thus, increased riverine input and rainfall often enhance the supply of silicate and decrease the salinity which can provide more suitable conditions for diatom growth. In this study, diatom and dinoflagellate biomarkers did not display any correlation with long‐chain
