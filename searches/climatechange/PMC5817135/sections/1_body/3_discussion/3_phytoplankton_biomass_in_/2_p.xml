<p class="p">Temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations are regarded as the fundamental environmental factors determining phytoplankton niches. Recently, statistical analysis of time series data in the Baltic Sea and Caribbean Sea showed that the importance of temperature, salinity, and irradiance for the niches of diatoms and dinoflagellates is even higher than macronutrient concentrations (Gasiūnaitė et al.,

 </math> temperature during 1997–2011 increased approximately 1°C, rainfall increased 248.2 mm, and brassicasterol and dinosterol sediment contents increased 8.5 and 1.7 times, respectively. The PCA indicated that warming temperature has a more significant impact on the increases in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass than terrestrial input. The driving mechanism of warming temperature on phytoplankton biomass is complicated as most results from open sea showed that ocean warming can enhance the vertical stratification, which could reduce the nutrient supply to the mixed‐layer and consequently reduce phytoplankton biomass in the surface water (Behrenfeld et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, some studies indicated that warming temperature can accelerate nutrient recycling by bacteria, resulting in phytoplankton increase (Taucher &amp; Oschlies, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In Cygnet Bay, the seawater is well mixed due to the shallow depth (9.8 m) and strong tidal action all year round. Thus, the increase in phytoplankton biomass was more possibly attributed to positive physiological action and fast nutrient turnover. Some studies in northwestern Australia emphasized a mechanism of ocean‐coast interaction that could influence the coastal phytoplankton biomass, for example, in the North West Cape, the increase of phytoplankton biomass in coastal waters could be caused by increased nutrients transport from the deep sea through enhanced upwelling (Furnas, 
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In Darwin Harbour, Burford, Alongi, Mckinnon, and Trott (
 <xref rid="ece33836-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) found that the oceanic inputs of nutrients to the estuary were a primary contributor. However, due to a lack of observational data, the mechanism of the ocean‐coast interaction in the Kimberley needs further exploration.
