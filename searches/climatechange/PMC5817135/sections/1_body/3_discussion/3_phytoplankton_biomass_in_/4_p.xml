<p class="p">In summary, the paleoecological evidence from Cygnet Bay demonstrated that SST and terrestrial input have significantly increased since 1997 in the Kimberley region, and the biomasses of diatoms and dinoflagellates corresponded to these changes with an increasing trend. In comparison, warming SST played a more important role for the phytoplankton increase than increased rainfall and river discharge.</p>
