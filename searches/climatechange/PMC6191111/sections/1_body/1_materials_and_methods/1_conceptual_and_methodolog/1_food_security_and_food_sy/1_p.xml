 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], this paper focuses on how disruptions in any of the four key food security components (i.e. availability, food access, utilization and stability) affect household and community food systems vulnerability to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Under this framework, food 
 <italic class="italic">availability</italic> is driven by food production, exchange, or distribution; a
 <italic class="italic">ccess</italic> represents the ability to consume preferred food sources; and 
 <italic class="italic">utilization</italic> refers to the quality and the social value that people give to their food. At the same time, these food security components need to be 
 <italic class="italic">stable</italic> over time to assure food security [
 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. As such, food insecurity includes, for example, when food might be available but may not satisfy cultural preferences; food could be available and culturally acceptable, but not necessarily cover individual nutritional needs; or; food could cover nutritional needs and be culturally acceptable, yet availability throughout the year is not guaranteed.
