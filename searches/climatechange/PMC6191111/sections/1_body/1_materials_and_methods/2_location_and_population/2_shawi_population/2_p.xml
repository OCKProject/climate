<p class="p">Communities were selected after extensive consultation with Indigenous representatives at national and local levels, all of whom partnered with the researchers to develop an international research program, the Indigenous Health and Adaptation to Climate Change (IHACC) project. The two communities in the qualitative study were partner with based on their location between the most easily accessible (1hr road to the closest urban place) and the most distant community (2.0 hr road plus 6 hr on foot to the closest urban place) to reflect a diversity of access experiences in the region. Participants within communities were selected according to the location of their household to reflect a range of geographical access to the center of the community, where main educational and health services (if any) were located.</p>
