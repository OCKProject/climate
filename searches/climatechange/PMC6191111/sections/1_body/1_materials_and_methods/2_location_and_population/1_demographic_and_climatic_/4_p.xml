<p class="p">There are no downscaled future climate projections specifically for the region encompassing the Shawi settlements. Data from the nearest region, San Martin, however, indicate that annual average temperatures are projected to increase up to +1.8°C, with few changes to precipitations by 2030 (Ministerio del Ambiente, 2016). It is projected that rainfall will stay within its normal annual variability (+/-5°C), although seasonal precipitation changes are expected from -3% between December through March to +3% in April through June [
