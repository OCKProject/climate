<p class="p">A photovoice exercise was conducted with three groups: females (23–37 y), males (28–37 y) and youth of both sexes (13–16 y). Photovoice is a participatory method that allows participants to answer a research question with pictures that represent issues or concerns relevant for individuals and the community [

 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Two workshops were performed with each photovoice group. In the first workshop, the researcher explained the purpose of the exercise, the role of photovoice, the specific research questions, and how to use a digital camera. The research questions were “What helps you eat well?” and “What prevents you from getting food?” Participants were instructed to avoid taking photographs that included personal identifiers (e.g. faces) to ensure the privacy of community members. Each participant kept a camera for a period of 2 to 3 days, with photography aiming to capture visual pictures responding to the research question. During the second workshop, each participant was asked to select 5–6 photographs that they considered the most representative or important to answer the research question. These selections were printed and formed the basis of discussions in the second workshop.
