<p class="p">All fieldwork was facilitated by one lead Shawi collaborator who was fluent in both Shawi and Spanish. The majority of participants preferred to converse in the Shawi language during research activities. Translations to Spanish were conducted in the presence of each participant to corroborate answers. Interviews were audio recorded, after participants provided consent. Reflective and descriptive journals were kept by the main investigator (CZ) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants, including teachers and elders. Key informants were invited to participate, looking to reflect the diverse opinions of households located at different distances from the main community centre. Teachers provided complementary information about food sources received from governmental feeding programs at the school, and elders were included as the founders of those communities. Example questions included: What time of year is the best for eating well? What are factors that make this a good time for food? Do you remember a time when there was a severe food scarcity for you and your family? We did not explicitly ask questions about climate change, as we sought to understand more broadly how weather and seasonality affect food systems in the context of non-climatic conditions. Transect walks were conducted with two participants, who conducted tours of their lands. This approach sought to observe and discuss food production on the land and to explore constraints related to crop production and food processing. Two collective meetings with Shawi authorities and community members were organized to discuss preliminary findings and to validate emergent themes.
