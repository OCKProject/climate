<p class="p">Changing climatic conditions have already been reported in Amazonia, affecting the food security of local populations, however, consequences for Indigenous food systems are still largely unknown. Warming temperatures have been documented, with an average increase of 0.34C per decade recorded since 1980 [

For Peruvian Indigenous Amazonian populations, however, initial research suggests that non-climatic drivers such as economic disadvantages and cultural marginalization are acting to magnify climatic impacts on food security [

Yet this are of research is only nascent, and our understanding of how Indigenous Amazonian food systems interact with climatic and non-climatic changes to affect food security, nutrition, and ultimately human health is limited.
