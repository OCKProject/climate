<p class="p">Despite numerous recognized sources of local foods, participants reported that the Shawi diet was changing and it was reflected in the dynamic interactions among the three food sub-systems. First, there was consensus among participants that large and highly-valued forest animals, which represent the most preferred type of local food, were increasingly unavailable. In this context, the Shawi reported increasingly turning to minor, less preferred species such as rodents, small species of fish, insects and crustaceans (e.g. river small shrimps). Male photovoice participants identified “
 <italic class="italic">food that is simple to get</italic>” as a key theme, presenting a series of photographs depicting the type and amount of food that they were increasingly accessing to substitute diets when other larger and preferred species were unavailable. Photographs within this theme depicted rodents, fish, cassava and plantain, which were described as foods that were available but less desired. In contrast, photographs of larger animals such as deer, pecari, armadillo, monkey and alligator were seen as declining yet preferred. Other food sources reported as substituting for a decline in preferred forest animals included farmed foods or domestic animals, purchase, and external food aid.
