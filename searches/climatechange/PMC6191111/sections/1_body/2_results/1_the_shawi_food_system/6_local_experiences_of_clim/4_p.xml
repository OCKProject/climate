<p class="p">The Shawi reported knowledge regarding water river variability and what do to in response to flash flooding events that regularly affected their communities. Key informants reported that the local river experienced sudden level changes, with flash flooding typically occurring at some point in the beginning and at the end of the wet season, between September-October and March-April respectively. They described water increases that rapidly lead to water overflow, with flooding typically lasting a few minutes to a maximum of one hour, and reaching only few centimeters high, thus affecting low lands and some parts of the center of the community. Elder participants mentioned that they did not deforest, crop, or build their homes on these low lands or close to the edges of the river to prevent risk of flooding.</p>
