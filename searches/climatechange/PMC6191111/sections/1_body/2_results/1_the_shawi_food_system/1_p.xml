<p class="p">Three main food sub-systems are currently ongoing and interact with each other in the Shawi communities participating in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205714.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). These included: 1) wild food accessed from the forest; 2) food cultivated through farming; and 3) food acquired from external sources. Ongoing food acquisition from wild forest resources and food production in household gardens comprised more localized food systems, but also use of more distant land spaces in the forest that are adapted to produce crops annually and throughout the year. Cash conditional transfer programs and food aid distributed within the community or at school represented more recent and external components within the food system. Access to cash income to purchase food remained rare within the communities. Local Shawi food sub-systems were predominantly based on locally developed knowledge and technology, while the external food sub-system was generally sponsored by governmental initiatives, either by working within communities (e.g. school feeding programs) or in the closest city (e.g. to receive cash benefits).
