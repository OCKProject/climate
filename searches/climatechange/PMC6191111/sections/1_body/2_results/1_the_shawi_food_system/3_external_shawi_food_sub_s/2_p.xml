 <italic class="italic">regatones</italic>). We observed that 
 <italic class="italic">regatones</italic> generally sold salty fish. One of our study communities had a small local store, and we observed eggs (not locally produced), canned tuna, cookies, rice, sugar, candies, beer and cigarettes were for sale. One key informant explained that neither cassava nor plantain was sold in the local store because “
