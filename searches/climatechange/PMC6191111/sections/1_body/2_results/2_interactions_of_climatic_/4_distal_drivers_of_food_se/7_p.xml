 <italic class="italic">Juntos</italic> provides economic incentives ($ 60.00 US bi monthly) to poor and extremely poor households under the condition that household participants must complete various requirements including 85% attendance at school for children 6-14yrs[

 <italic class="italic">Qali Warma</italic> feeding program delivers food only to children who attend to school. This implies that external aid could exacerbate a maladaptive trajectory by promoting education in a place where economic job opportunities are limited for educated Shawi and where access to cash to cover expenses for higher education is also scare. External food and aid operates under a Peruvian economic model that does not support local capacity, potentially increasing vulnerability because it erodes social cohesion by ignoring Shawi culture such as language, food preferences, and local Indigenous social institutions (e.g. sharing food and gender roles). Food sharing networks for example, are widespread among Shawi communities, and ensure food for vulnerable sub-populations (e.g. Elders) in difficult times. Food sharing networks were mainly based on sharing of local food sources [
 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. However, food aid used non-Shawi or non-preferred foods, and targets individuals within households with negligible consideration of cultural norms around sharing and food production. Shawi farming and forest sub-food system activities were based on gender participation, for example, where males were associated with hunting and women with gardening. Given that bushmeat was decreasing, males were also losing their main social activity 
 <italic class="italic">vis a vis</italic> food provision, implying that males were facing the Shawi cultural equivalent of unemployment. However, national food and cash governmental programs target mainly women and thus have limited consideration of the eroding social hunting norms among Shawi men while simultaneously increasing labour and responsibility for women.
