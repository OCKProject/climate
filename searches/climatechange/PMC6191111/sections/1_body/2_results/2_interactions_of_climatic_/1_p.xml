<p class="p">Shawi households and communities were exposed to multiple drivers affecting their food systems and shaping their current and future vulnerability to climate change. Climatic and non-climatic drivers interacted at two levels to shape Shawi food security vulnerability: one 
 <italic class="italic">proximal</italic> level that immediately threatens the local capacity of Shawi households and communities, and a second 
 <italic class="italic">distal</italic> level that will compromised further local responses to climate change by reinforcing proximal drivers, and thus potentially increasing the vulnerability of Shawi to climate change risks.
