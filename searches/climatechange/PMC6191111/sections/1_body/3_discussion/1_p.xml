<p class="p">This paper aimed to characterize the food system of the Shawi of the Peruvian Amazon, climatic and non-climatic drivers of their food security vulnerability to climate change, and identify potential maladaptative pathways. Our investigation of the Shawi food system highlights how the natural environment, culture and socialization are fundamental components of the Shawi food system. Wildlife, local crops, collective activities, gender roles, and emotional connections comprise Shawi household and community food security; and represents important elements to understand complex interconnections between climatic and non-climatic stressors. Indeed, our vulnerability analysis indicated that multiple drivers were interacting to determine current Shawi food insecurity. Some drivers result from socioeconomic events in the past century, while many others were ongoing. The investigation of proximal and distal drivers of vulnerability has allowed us to identify potential maladaptive pathways that, unaddressed, could increase vulnerability to climatic and other stressors.</p>
