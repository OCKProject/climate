 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], requires further investigation in the context of Indigenous Amazonian peoples. Access to formal education could serve to build social capacity (e.g. better health and poverty reduction) to respond to and recover from to any future climatic risk. Education can also increase the awareness about risk perceptions and can improve the ability to take actions when facing a disaster [
 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Working with a population of low income settlements in El Salvador and Brazil, researchers found that the level of formal education affected the likelihood of living in a risky area and that those with more education identified greater options for recovery after a hazardous climatic event [

 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. This suggests that improving access to education in and of itself will not guarantee that communities will be more prepared to respond to climatic risks. For example, one study identified literacy as a key ability to access information and aid from governmental initiatives [
 <xref rid="pone.0205714.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. For the Shawi, this would translate into the causal expectation that education would improve their Spanish and thus facilitate better access to governmental aid. However, this assumes that the benefits of education will outweigh any potential losses in local and Indigenous knowledge about preparedness and response to risk. Educational opportunities are likely critical for future generations of Shawi but should be developed in a way that does not erode existing coping mechanisms for food security and does not compromise food sources, for example culturally and nutritionally important food types [
