 <p class="p">Pictures voluntarily chosen by participants in the Photovoice have been included as Supporting Information file 2 for transparency. However, there are ethical restrictions on sharing the rest of the qualitative data because interview transcripts and audio files cannot be completely de-identified. The data are available upon request to researchers qualified to manage confidential information. To request data access, researchers should contact the Ethics Board of Cayetano University at
