<p class="p">Currently 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> populations occur in six rainforest community regional ecosystem (RE) types, one of which is ‘endangered’ and four of which are ‘of concern’ as defined by the 
 <italic class="italic">Vegetation Management Act 1999</italic> (VMA; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The six RE types are classified structurally as either notophyll vine forests or tall open forests with vine forest understory
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. The majority of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> populations are found in simple notophyll vine forests
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>, usually with abundant Bangalow palm, 
 <italic class="italic">Archontophoenix cunninghamiana</italic> (H.Wendl.)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>, on Mesozoic to Proterozoic igneous rocks. The southeast Queensland bioclimatic model (SDM2) found that, under baseline climatic conditions, approximately 59% (1300 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the high probability habitat areas are associated with areas that have been cleared. Only 8% (200 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the high probability habitat is found within the six RE types which currently accommodate 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic>. The remaining 33% (800 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) are associated with RE types in which the species has never been reported, although these do include notophyll vine forests and other endangered ecosystems (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The contribution of high probability habitat associated with the six RE types was further reduced when geological and geomorphological variables were incorporated in the model (SDM3), covering only 12.0% (100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the high probability habitat areas within the southeast Queensland region under baseline climatic conditions.
