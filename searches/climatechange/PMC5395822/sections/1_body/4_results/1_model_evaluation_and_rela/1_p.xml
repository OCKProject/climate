<p class="p">Five predictor variables were selected to develop the eastern Australia model (SDM1), and four predictor variables were selected for the southeast Queensland bioclimatic/substrate models (SDM2 &amp; SDM3; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The results of the AUC and TSS analyses indicated that, on average, the models were significantly better than random and have good discrimination ability (SDM1, AUC = 0.996, TSS = 0.861; SDM2, AUC = 0.984, TSS = 0.807; SDM3, AUC = 0.986, TSS = 0.765). The precipitation of the coldest quarter made the highest relative contribution in SDM1 (43.3%), followed by the precipitation of the warmest quarter (25.2%; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In SDM2, the precipitation of the warmest quarter contributed the most (82.8%), followed by the precipitation of the driest month (16.2%). These two bioclimatic variables were again powerful predictors in SDM3 (57.4%), however as expected, the geological and geomorphological variables also made a strong contribution (42.6%). Rock type such as granitoid, poorly consolidated sediments, and sedimentary rock
