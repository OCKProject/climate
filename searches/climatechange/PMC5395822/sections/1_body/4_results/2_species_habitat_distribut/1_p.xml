<p class="p">The eastern Australia bioclimatic model (SDM1) identified several major habitat areas for 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> along coastal eastern Australia under baseline climatic conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The model suggests considerable southward and upslope contraction of the species habitat range particularly in north Queensland under projected climate change, and this was greater with the A1FI high emission scenario. Some novel regions of coastal New South Wales may become suitable habitat by 2070 under either emission scenario. The southeast Queensland bioclimatic model (SDM2) projected high probability habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> to be currently found within the greater Sunshine Coast region, covering approximately 2300 km

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Small habitat patches are also projected in the southern end of the study area. With either emission scenario, a dramatic southward and upslope contraction is projected toward locations where the majority of known populations are currently found. The southeast Queensland substrate model (SDM3) identified much finer, patchy habitat areas within the bioclimatic envelope identified by SDM2, covering approximately 1000 km

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Although SDM3 followed the same contraction pattern as SDM2, reduction in the extent of suitable habitat in southeast Queensland was projected to be much slower, possibly due to the inclusion of geological and geomorphological variables as proxies for soil and landform potentially moderating local temperature and moisture conditions. As expected, contraction of the suitable habitat areas toward higher, cooler elevations are projected, due to rising temperatures and altered patterns of rainfall consistent with climate change projections in coastal eastern Australia
