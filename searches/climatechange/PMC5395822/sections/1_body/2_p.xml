<p class="p">This study investigated potential change in the distribution of climatically suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> (Proteaceae) under various climate change scenarios, to identify refugia or potential translocation sites for future population management. We specifically investigated: (1) Where are populations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> in eastern Australia currently located, what kind of vegetation communities do they occur in, and how climatically suitable will this habitat be in the future? (2) Is the species distribution range, based on current locations defining the climatic suitability of habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic>, likely to recede or expand in response to climate change? (3) Which populations within the species distribution range are more likely to persist under projected climate change?
