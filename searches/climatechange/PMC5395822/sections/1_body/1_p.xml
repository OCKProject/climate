<p class="p">A growing number of studies have modelled the effects of climate change on a large number of plant species around the world

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to project future habitat distributions of a species using climate change scenarios

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, and can be successfully applied with small numbers of occurrence records
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia</italic> consists of four species, which occur in tropical to subtropical Australian rainforests between north Queensland and northern New South Wales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia robusta</italic> is a long-lived, subtropical rainforest shrub reported to have less than 750 adult plants remaining across 17 small populations in southeast Queensland
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>, and is ‘Endangered’ as defined by The 
 <italic class="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</italic> (EPBC Act), and IUCN Red List of threatened plants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. Empirical evidence suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> had historically low levels of gene flow and limited dispersal between populations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia robusta</italic> may have been more abundant in the landscape prior to habitat fragmentation following European settlement
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. The potential impact of climate change on the species’ habitat needs investigation to enable planning to support its conservation and persistence in to the future.
