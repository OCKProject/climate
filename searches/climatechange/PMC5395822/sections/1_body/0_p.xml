<p class="p">Climate change is considered a threat to biodiversity as the geographic distribution of suitable habitat for many plant species is expected to change, with range expansions and contractions in some cases increasing the risk of population isolation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Threatened species in rainforest communities are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climatic changes because of traits including narrow thermal tolerances, relatively small population sizes, and/or restricted distributions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Historical climate change in the late Quaternary Period led to significant contraction of Australian rainforest
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> to refugia which persisted under historical climate fluctuations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. However, rapid increases in temperature, and fluctuation in precipitation under projected climate change scenarios have the potential to further contract or expand the habitat range of already patchy rainforest communities in Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Subtropical rainforests occupy the interface between tropical and temperate influences; thus projected changes in climatic conditions may impact negatively on these communities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Subtropical rainforest communities in southeast Queensland have a high species diversity and contain many endangered and vulnerable species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. However, vegetation in the region is highly fragmented and approximately 56% of the original vegetation has been removed due to extensive land clearing, and many species are now at risk of extinction
