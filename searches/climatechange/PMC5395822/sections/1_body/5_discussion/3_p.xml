 <italic class="italic">Triunia robusta</italic> is a narrow endemic, being confined to fragmented subtropical rainforest remnants in southeast Queensland
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Fifteen out of 17 currently known populations occur in RE types that are either ‘endangered’ or ‘of concern’ as defined by the 
 <italic class="italic">Vegetation Management Act 1999</italic> (VMA). Within the species distribution range, the highest concentration of high probability habitat areas under baseline climatic conditions is found between Gympie and Beerburrum within the greater Sunshine Coast, where the majority of the currently known populations occur. These habitat areas are concentrated in the southern part of the species distribution range, which highlights the potential vulnerability of northern range populations to climate change. The extent of high probability habitat predicted to be associated with REs known to accommodate 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> was low overall, and is set amongst a landscape matrix comprising up to 59% of habitat that has been cleared or degraded. This suggests that landscape scale interruptions to ecological processes are likely to impact on the persistence of this species under climate change.
