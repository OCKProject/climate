<p class="p">Plant species that have lower reproductive rates and relatively long generation time such as 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> are thought to have longer lag times in response to climate change, and so be potentially isolated in unsuitable habitat as a future consequence
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>. The results of this study suggest that populations that are located in the Blackall Range on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, consistent with past rainforest refugia are likely to persist under future climate change. These include 10 currently known populations; three of which are located in Triunia National Park, six located in Mapleton State Forest, and one located in Wappa Dam Water Reserve
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. The Rocky Creek division of Mapleton State Forest Reserve and Wappa Dam falls are of particular importance, as these areas contain the three largest, most viable populations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> (&gt;300 individual plants)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. However, these less formal reserves currently receive a low level of long-term protection compared to areas protected by legislation and included in Australiaâ€™s National Reserve System
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref>. Upgrading the level of protection for the portion of the State Forest Reserve and Water Reserve containing 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> populations in the Blackall Range area will be a high priority to better protect the species over the long-term, particularly with respect to climate change.
