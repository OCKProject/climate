<p class="p">A recent study by Weber 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref> identified five centres of rainforest plant endemism in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales, including the Sunshine Coast hinterland, which may have functioned as refugia for subtropical rainforest species in the past

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref> also suggest that the co-occurring, related subtropical rainforest endemic tree genus 
 <italic class="italic">Macadamia</italic> (Proteaceae) may have persisted in refugial rainforest in southeast Queensland under the historical climatic fluctuations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>. This study of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> found that habitat areas within the species’ known distribution range are projected to show substantial upslope contraction toward areas consistent with past refugia, with the Blackall Range in the Sunshine Coast hinterland likely to be the species’ core habitat for the next 55 years. This is consistent with the area where the majority of the currently known, large and relatively stable populations occur
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Endemic species which currently occupy areas considered to be past refugia may be less likely to be affected greatly by future climate change at least in the short term
