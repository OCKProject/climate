<p class="p">This study utilised SDM as a tool to assess general trends of climate change impacts on the current and future habitat distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> at both continental and regional scales, and to suggest potential conservation priority areas for the long term persistence of the species. Further refinement of the SDMs with integration of higher resolution topographically-downscaled climate data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref> and better representations of substrate variables
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>, as well as species ecological dynamics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref> is necessary for better discrimination of future suitable habitat areas of 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> for predicting species long-term persistence under climate change, and confirm management recommendations.
