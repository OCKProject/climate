<p class="p">Many rainforest Proteaceae in Australia have restricted distributions and are confined to rainforest remnants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" class="xref">50</xref>. This study identified several spatially disjunct broad habitat areas of potential climatic suitability for the endangered shrub 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> (Proteaceae) under baseline climatic conditions, including the Wet Tropics of north Queensland, northwest of Mackay in central Queensland, the greater Sunshine Coast region in southeast Queensland, the Border Ranges on the state border of Queensland and New South Wales, and the Northern Tablelands in northern New South Wales located along costal eastern Australia. These areas are consistent with the current distribution of the major tropical and subtropical rainforest remnants of eastern Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. Interestingly, the potential habitat areas identified where 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> has not been recorded are currently occupied by its congeners 
 <italic class="italic">T. youngiana, T. erythrocarpa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. montana</italic>, suggesting that species in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia</italic> may share a similar climatic niche, although they may differ in substrate fidelity. Hence, the eastern Australian model developed in this study may be a better predictor for the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia</italic> than the individual species within the genus, suggesting the need to test a hypothesis of speciation in the genus following geographical isolation.
