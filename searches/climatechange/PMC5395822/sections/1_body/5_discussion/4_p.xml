<p class="p">Several studies argue that contemporary climate change over the last 100 years is already causing changes in the habitat distribution of many species

Habitat distributions of many plant species in the tropical and subtropical region of coastal eastern Australia are projected to show southward range expansion and upslope contraction due to rising temperatures and altered patterns of rainfall

 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic>, with the southern border of the species habitat range projected to extend to southern New South Wales. Suitable habitat areas in north Queensland are projected to be the first and worst affected, with habitat ranges showing substantial southward and upslope contraction, which may impact on the survivorship, vulnerability to disease, and reproductive success of existing populations of its congeneric species, given their limited dispersal ability to track suitable habitat. The results also indicate a possible emergence of novel climatically suitable habitat areas in central New South Wales, which may become viable translocation sites in the future, if substrate conditions are also found to be suitable.
