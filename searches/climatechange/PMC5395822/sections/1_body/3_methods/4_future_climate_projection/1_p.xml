<p class="p">Six future climate projections were derived using SimCLIM v2.5
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> for the three futures (2030, 2050 and 2070) and two emissions scenarios (IPCC AR4 A1FI and A2) using an ensemble of five GCMs (MIROC-M, CSIRO-MK3.5, MIUB-ECHO-G, IPSL, and MRI)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. These GCMs have proven to be some of the most reliable and commonly used climate models over the Australian region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. The A1FI emission scenario is characterised by the highest severity projection of fossil fuel energy sources, rapid economic growth, and the global population growth peaking in the mid-century then declining thereafter
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. This emission scenario is approximately equivalent to the RCP 8.5, a class of representative concentration pathways (RCP) developed for the IPCC 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> assessment report (AR5)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Conversely, the A2 emission scenario represents high primary energy consumption, with moderate economic growth and continuous population growth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. These scenarios were chosen to explore differences between globally oriented and more regionally oriented climate change projections, although the A2 scenario also tracks well above RCP 6.0 and below RCP 8.5
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. For SDM3, assumptions were made that geology and landform would remain unaltered for the modelling period. The same non-climatic datasets were used for all projections.
