<p class="p">Model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of the cross validated model output. An AUC score of 1.0 indicates a statistically valid, perfectly fitting model, while an AUC value of &lt;0.5 indicates a model performing poorly and no better than random
