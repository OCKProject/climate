<p class="p">Topographic, geological and geomorphological variables are known to be critical factors defining plant distributions because of their influence on soil and substrate conditions supporting plant growth, and therefore have a large impact on persistence
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Elevation, slope and aspect (in degrees) were explored as candidate variables in this study, and were generated from the 25â€‰m southeast Queensland Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> in ArcGIS v10.2
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. In addition, a detailed solid geology of Queensland dataset
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>, and a land zone of Queensland dataset
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> were obtained. The land zone dataset derives from the Regional Ecosystems (RE) vegetation dataset of Queensland v8.0
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>, which enabled the use of RE envelopes without floristic and community structure. These datasets are of 1:50,000 to 1:100,000 scale, and therefore are detailed enough to segregate into land zones for the purpose of this study.
