<p class="p">We explored 14 climatic and five topographical, geological and geomorphological variables as candidate predictors for the 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> model that are relevant to plant species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The climatic variables included annual (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation), seasonal (quarterly mean temperature and precipitation), and extreme or limiting environmental factors such as temperature of the coldest and warmest month. These variables relate to the biological and eco-physiological tolerance range of plant species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The 14 climate variables were derived from SimCLIM v2.5

SimCLIM is a computer-based climate simulation database system which generates temperature and precipitation anomalies from up to 23 global circulation model (GCM) with spatial resolutions ranging from 100 to 400 km horizontal grids downscaled to a 1 km × 1 km grid resolution for eastern Australia
