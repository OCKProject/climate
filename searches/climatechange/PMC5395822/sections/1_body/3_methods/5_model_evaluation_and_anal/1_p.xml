<p class="p">The baseline model outputs (1990 climates) were used to determine which variables were the best predictors of the species’ range distribution. For each model, distribution maps indicating habitat probability were generated for the three futures (2030, 2050 and 2070) and two emissions scenario (A2 and A1FI). Habitat distribution maps of SDM2 and SDM3 were reclassified to discriminate high and low probability habitat; the minimum probability threshold value was applied based on the mean 10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile training presence value across cross-validated models, which uses the 10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of the probability threshold range of the species’ presence records. This non-fixed specific threshold value has been widely used to determine minimum habitat probability threshold values for generating binary maps in many SDM studies
