<p class="p">To identify the most informative contributing subsets of variables for each 
 <italic class="italic">T. robusta</italic> model, all variables were tested for multicollinearity by conducting Spearman’s rank correlation analysis in SPSS v21.0
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, with a threshold of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> &gt; 0.83 to indicate a significant relationship. For significantly correlated pairs of variables, those that made the least contribution to model performance and prediction were omitted based on the Maxent jack knife test results. The results of cross-correlation analysis were reflected accordingly in the final models. The final baseline models (fitted to 1990 climate variables) were then run with five-fold cross validation. Ten thousand background points were automatically and randomly selected by the model; from across eastern Australia for SDM1, and from southeast Queensland for SDM2 and SDM3. Maxent was run with 500 iterations and the logistic output format, which represents the habitat probability values of the target species within the range of 0 to 1 for each grid cell in the model
