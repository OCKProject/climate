<p class="p">Two nested study areas were investigated: (1) eastern Australia (the political jurisdictions of Queensland and New South Wales), incorporating the currently known distribution of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Triunia</italic> in Australia based on herbarium voucher records
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, and (2) southeast Queensland, encompassing the known distribution range of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> (boundaries shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). All 17 known populations were visited, and the location of the approximate centroid of each population was accurately recorded using a handheld GPS device (Â±10 metres). The majority of the populations cover an area of less than 0.15 ha
