<p class="p">In this study, we describe a unique dataset of sweet cherry flowering and maturity records for 25 sites in Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) with highly contrasted climates. Past studies showed that phenology data spanning 20 or 30 years were valuable for climate change related analyses

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>,

 </sup>. Thus the dataset presented here, with an overall 37 year-period (1978â€“2015, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) will be valuable for phenology and climate change studies. This dataset covers a wide range of European latitudes and longitudes and is unique in its collection of cultivars (between 1 and 191 cultivars per site), each cultivar being represented by clones of the same original tree in each country, which supports robust analyses of plasticity and response to climatic conditions.
