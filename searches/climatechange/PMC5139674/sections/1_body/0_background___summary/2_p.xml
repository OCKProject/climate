<p class="p">Large phenological datasets are key for the development of phenological models (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22â€“25</xref>), which are valuable tools to support breeding strategies. Although recent studies have shown the value of a wide range of data
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>, most analyses for fruit tree crops are based on phenological data for a very limited number of experimental sites, and rarely include more than two cultivars within a species (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>).
