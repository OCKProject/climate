<p class="p">Sweet cherry trees are particularly interesting for phenology studies, their long orchard life providing the potential for long-term datasets. Reference cultivars have been planted and observed for decades for phenology and productivity traits in trials dedicated to new hybrids characterization. For example, at the Fruit Experimental Station (Toulenne, INRA Bordeaux, France), phenological data have been recorded for ‘Burlat’ cultivar for 35 years. Consequently, large phenological datasets are available for reference cultivars in many European orchards involved in breeding programmes. Despite this, long historical datasets of fruit tree phenology are rarely analysed together or made available to the scientific community. A few analyses on sweet cherry phenology in Europe were published using the phenological observations of fruit trees by the German Weather Service (DWD)
