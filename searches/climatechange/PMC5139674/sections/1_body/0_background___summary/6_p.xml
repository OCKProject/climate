<p class="p">Overall, despite the fact that they are heterogeneous, data from the different sites can be combined in integrated analysis to study their responses to environment. Such dataset is extremely valuable for characterizing the phenology response to climate change and the plasticity of the different cultivar behaviour under various environmental conditions. In addition, these records can support the development of predictive models exploitable at the continental scale that can be used by growers and breeders, and to anticipate breeding strategies in order to maintain and improve sweet cherry production in Europe.</p>
