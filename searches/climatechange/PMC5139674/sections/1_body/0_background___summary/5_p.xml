<p class="p">Since data were collected from various experimental stations, the dataset is not homogeneous regarding the number of cultivars (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) or the record length (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Past research have shown the value of using heterogeneous records combined from different sites and cultivars for the evaluation of climate change response and phenology modelling approaches (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35â€“38</xref>). In particular, phenology models have been successfully tested and optimized using data sourced from different sites
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we want to highlight the value of this dataset, combining data from various geographical sites and contrasted cultivars, for potential multi-environment analyses yet to be implemented. 13 out of 25 sites meet the criteria of more than 15 recorded years that was shown to be useful for climate change analysis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Single site analyses can thus be applied to track phenological climate shifts in a given environment. Subsequently, phenology models can be further evaluated by pooling data across geographically and climatically varied sites, leading to a better knowledge of climate-phenology relations. Extreme European climate, e.g., South of Spain, can be used to investigate climate analogues for projected climatic scenarios

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, for eight sites, two or more cultivars were observed for at least 15 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Between cultivar differences can be assessed at a single site and across sites with common cultivars. These analyses can reveal whether some cultivars are more susceptible to evolution in climatic conditions. The dataset offers the possibility to study different flowering phase data, namely beginning, full and end of flowering, together with maturity dates for some cultivars (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and to perform sequential phenology phase assessments.
