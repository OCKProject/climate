<p class="p">Sweet cherry phenological data were collated from French and European networks. Established in 1952, CTIFL is a non-profit organization involved in the French fruit and vegetable industry. It developed a private database dedicated to information on cultivars planted in experimental orchards. Flowering and maturity dates for up to 191 reference cultivars grown in French experimental stations were extracted from the database. At the European scale, in the context of the COST Action 1104 (2012â€“2016;

Flowering and maturity dates together with the protocol details for the observations were collected. Although a standardisation of the recorded stages is on-going within the group, past observation standards for the different flowering stages are not homogeneous and are described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. They correspond to a percentage of open flowers or fallen petals. Since the development of the BBCH scale (

 </sup>. Here, where possible, we associated the recorded stages, as defined in each experimental location for observations, with the corresponding BBCH stage (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In every location, one or two observers were in charge of recording the phenology dates. At the end of the season, records were added to the dataset. We calculated the length of the flowering season, which is the number of days between beginning and end of flowering, where these dates were available.
