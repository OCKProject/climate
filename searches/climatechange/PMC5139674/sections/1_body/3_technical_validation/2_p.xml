<p class="p">For records of more than 15 years, we checked the consistency of collected data between sites. This cross-checking showed data for a given cultivar were highly correlated, even for sites as far as 400 km from each other (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), confirming that the collected data are consistent. In addition, when possible, we chose to compare our data to similar phenological observational records from the European phenology database PEP725 (

Data for ‘early cultivar’ and ‘late cultivar’ were retrieved from the database and correlated with close-by sites when at least 15 common years of data were available. We identified PEP stations located within a range of 200 km for Bonn, Conthey, Gembloux and Jork. Strong correlations and minimal differences were found between our data and the flowering dates recorded and validated in PEP725 (
