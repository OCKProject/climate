<p class="p">Flowering and maturity dates from all sites can be found in the dataset file stored in the Dryad Digital Repository (Data Citation 1). The spread sheet consists of a table with the description of all phenological data (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The experimental sites are described by name, latitude, longitude and altitude. Each row corresponds to the dates (beginning of flowering, full flowering, end of flowering, beginning of maturity) documented each year for one tree when available, or the average of several trees for each cultivar. For registration reasons, one cultivar can be registered and observed under different clone numbers, ranging from 1 to 7 clone accession numbers, so the clone number was indicated when available. The cultivar name was always indicated and when available the rootstock information was provided. Dates recorded were also provided as day of year (starting with 1 for January 1st) and the duration of flowering was calculated (days).
