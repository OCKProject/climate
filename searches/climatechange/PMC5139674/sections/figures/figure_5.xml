  <p class="p">For the Bonn site, PEP725 data were obtained from the station 1360, located in Zülpich (Germany; longitude: 6.67; latitude: 50.68; distance from Bonn: 23 km). Gembloux data were compared to flowering dates from the station 1498, located in Übach-Palenberg (Germany, longitude: 6.12; latitude: 50.92; distance: 110 km). For Jork, PEP725 data were obtained from the station 346, located in Hamburg-Altengamme (Germany; longitude: 10.28; latitude: 53.43; distance: 37 km). Conthey data were compared to full flowering (BBCH stage 65) dates from station 3260 (Müllheim, Germany; longitude: 7.63; latitude: 47.82, distance: 178 km). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated for each site between our data and corresponding PEP725 data.</p>
