<p class="p">This study constructed a national dataset of GHG emissions associated with the production of major food items in India, and incorporates variability in emissions from a range of production systems. We used comprehensive agricultural activity data at the farm-level, and a state-of-the-art greenhouse gas accounting tool. We highlight the risk of a likely increase in GHG emissions if diets transition towards increased consumption of animal-based products, and also observe a wide range of emissions from cereal production. In addition to general measures to improve efficient use of nutrients and organic matter stocks, there is also likely to be benefit in developing support mechanisms to target those products with the highest emissions 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> unit of production. We hypothesise that in such cases, mitigation of GHG emissions will be a co-benefit of improved and more efficient agronomic practice, but these options would have to consider the nutritional and health implication for the Indian diet.
