<p class="p">GHG emission calculations for agricultural production of the commonly consumed food items in India are based on a substantial dataset with representative plots across the country. This analysis gives an overview of GHG emissions produced through on-farm management at different locations, representing diverse soil types and climatic conditions, and encompasses major drivers of variation within the country. Using the same model to calculate GHG emissions for all of the major food groups allows emissions from different crops and products to be compared.</p>
