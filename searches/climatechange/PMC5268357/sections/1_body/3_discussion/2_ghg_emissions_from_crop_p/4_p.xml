<p class="p">The reported estimates of GHG emissions from farm management differ across the above studies partly because each uses different boundary conditions. In our study, the calculated GHG emissions on a 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic>-ha-scale follow the same methods for all crops and differ mainly because of changes in management and fertiliser use for crops. For cereals in general, less fertiliser is used in India than in Europe. These differences are also partly reflected in yield. The yields for cereals, pulses and potatoes have increased over recent years in India, but are still only half of those recorded in Western Europe and North America (

 <italic class="italic">per</italic>-kg-production-basis, as GHG emissions will be greater for low yielding crops than for higher yielding ones using a 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic>-kg metric. For instance, according to
