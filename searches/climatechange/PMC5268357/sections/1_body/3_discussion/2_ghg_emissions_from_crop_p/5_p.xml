<p class="p">The highest GHG emissions among crops are associated with paddy rice production. Emissions of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> from rice production are recognised as a significant source of GHG emissions globally, and many studies show that changes in water management can substantially reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions and increase yield through optimising drainage and manure management (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions. Although some studies show that N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions may increase under intermittent irrigation the decrease in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions more than compensates this effect (

In rice management, key elements are fertiliser management by reducing synthetic fertiliser inputs, increasing organic manure, and improved water management, as discussed above.
