GHG emissions associated with livestock products depend largely on feed inputs, and in other studies have been shown to range between 0.8–2.4 kg CO

Our milk and poultry results for India are within the range of these studies. The calculated emissions for mutton are higher than in the above discussed studies, resulting from embedded emissions in feed, which is 50–75% of the total GHG emissions
