<p class="p">Ruminants produce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> through enteric fermentation, and options to mitigate this source are somewhat limited (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beauchemin et al., 2011</xref>). Other sources of emissions from livestock production are manure management and changed feed rations. To reduce GHG emissions from manure management options include (i) changes to manure storage, e.g. decreased storage time, manure storage cover with straw, or mechanical intermittent aeration during manure storage (

 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>). To reduce GHG emissions from feed, all mitigation measures previously discussed for crops could be considered, as well as using the residues from crop production as feed.
