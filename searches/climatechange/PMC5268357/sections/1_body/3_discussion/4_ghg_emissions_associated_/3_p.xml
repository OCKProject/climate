<p class="p">The mitigation potential in livestock production therefore needs to be further explored. In addition to the mitigation options in on-farm management, dietary change could help to decrease GHG emissions considerably, but advice to change dietary intakes to reduce GHG emissions would need to consider the nutritional implications, so as not to compromise health (
