 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). There are more data for the most widely consumed crops (i.e. wheat and rice; 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) than other products. The variability in GHG emissions for wheat is less than that for rice or potato. For paddy rice, &gt;10,000 plots were available for analysis with a wide range of management practices, which is reflected in the GHG emission results. The main reason for the wide range in GHG emissions seen in rice is water management, which is the main determinant of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions. In particular, continuous flooding generates the highest CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, while longer and more frequent periods of water drainage reduces emissions. For example, changing the water regime from continuously flooded to multiple drainage periods, reduces CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions by 9-fold (data not shown). High emissions on a
