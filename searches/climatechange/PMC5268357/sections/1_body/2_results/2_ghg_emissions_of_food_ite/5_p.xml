<p class="p">GHG emissions 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> kcal show a different ranking, although products from ruminant animals have the highest emissions using all metrics. GHG emissions 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> kcal show a small increase across cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits and animal-source foods. Rice in particular had higher emissions than other crops, and mutton meat had markedly high emissions, several times more than other animal-source products.
