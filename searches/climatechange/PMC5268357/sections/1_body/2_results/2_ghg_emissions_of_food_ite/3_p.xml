<p class="p">With the exception of flooded rice, the major source of variation in GHG emissions for crops is due to variation in fertiliser application. The results show a wide range of GHG emissions for rice, potato and sugarcane on a 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic>-ha-basis, and a narrow range for other crops (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>B). The groups “other cereals” (i.e. bajra, barley, maize, ragi and jowar), and “other pulses” (i.e. black, red and green gram), had broadly similar GHG emissions. Emissions from vegetable oil crops showed more variation across the different crops (i.e. coconut, rapeseed, soybean, safflower, sesamum, sunflower).
