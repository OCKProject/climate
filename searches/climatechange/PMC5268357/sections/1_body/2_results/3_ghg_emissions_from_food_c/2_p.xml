 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>A shows relative reported consumption by weight of commodities in the IMS, while 3B shows their relative contribution to emissions. Rice and livestock products contribute the most to total dietary GHG emissions, with the third contributor being ruminant meat. Although ruminant meat had the greatest GHG emissions 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> unit product, it contributed less to overall GHG emissions (12.5%) as consumption is low, accounting for only 0.4% of total intake. Cereals other than rice and fruit products account for 12.9% and 22.5% of reported consumption by weight, yet as their emissions 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> unit of product are low, they make a relatively small contribution to total dietary GHG emissions, representing only 3.2% and 1.1% of total emissions, respectively. The group “other” (including various crops from the subgroups nuts and oils, spices, and vegetables) also contributed little to total dietary GHG emissions.
