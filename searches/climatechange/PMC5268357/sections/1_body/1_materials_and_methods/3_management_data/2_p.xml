<p class="p">Agricultural input and management information, including yield of major crops grown in India, were obtained from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Government of India (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eands.dacnet.nic.in" id="intr0010" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://eands.dacnet.nic.in</ext-link> [accessed 01.10.2015]). The Government of India conducts cost of cultivation surveys at the Indian district level using multi-stage sampling. Districts within states, and villages within districts, formed the first and second stage unit of sampling with the ultimate unit of data collection being the household (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CSO, 2002</xref>). The district and villages were selected in order to cover the major crops grown in the country. 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> shows the locations of households selected for the survey, which forms the foundation of the activity data used in this study. In total, there were 34,577 data points across India used in the study. Of these, 53% of data points were for paddy rice and wheat, representing the proportionate area under rice and wheat cultivation in India. Data on temperature and rainfall were obtained from the WorldClim global climate database (

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shangguan et al. (2014)</xref>. The water management system before and during rice cultivation was determined from databases at national and state levels (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gupta et al., 2009</xref>), and expert opinion (experts from CIMMYT). The analysis includes a representative distribution of irrigation management strategies for rice, from flooded to alternative wetting and drying systems. In India, agricultural residues left in the field after harvest are sometimes burnt

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gadde et al. (2009)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jain et al. (2014)</xref> at state level. The area under different crop cultivation in each state and union territory were obtained from state agriculture departments, the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Government of India, and FAOSTAT (
