<p class="p">GHG emissions from crops were calculated using the Cool Farm Tool (CFT) (

The CFT is a GHG emission calculator which allows users to estimate annual GHG emissions associated with the production of crops or livestock products from production to the farm gate (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hillier et al., 2011</xref>). It comprises a generic set of empirical models that are used to estimate full farm-gate product emissions constituting a mix of Tier 1, Tier 2, and simple Tier 3 approaches (see 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 1997</xref> for definitions of tiers for GHG estimation in national GHG inventories). GHG emissions were estimated from inputs including general information about soil and climate, and the set of management options on the farm: fertilisation, pesticide and herbicide use, residue management, machinery and energy use.
