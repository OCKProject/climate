<p class="p">We calculated GHG emissions from agricultural production of several crops and livestock products in India (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Items for analysis were chosen from the total list of consumed foods recorded in the Indian Migration Study (IMS), a regional survey that measured dietary intake in 2005–2007 (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bowen et al., 2011</xref>). Based on project logistics, we set an objective of analysing a set of 20 food items. We used two criteria to choose items for analysis: having at least one item from each broad food group (i.e., cereals, pulses, tubers, vegetables, etc.); and within each group, selecting items reported to be consumed in the greatest quantity within the study (in kg

 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), plus three crop groups (other cereals, other pulses and crops used for vegetable oils). These items represent about 72% of reported consumption of food (kg) in the IMS, and about 75% of consumption when assessed in a 2012 nationally-representative household expenditure survey (

Fish and seafood were excluded from the study. This is because the consumption of these groups was low within the IMS sample which meant that the additional methodological effort and data acquisition required to conduct the analysis was not justified. Our study therefore focusses on agricultural produce.
