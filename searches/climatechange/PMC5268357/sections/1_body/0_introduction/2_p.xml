<p class="p">Agriculture is an important sector of the economy in India, contributing about 20% of national gross domestic product, and providing a livelihood for nearly two-thirds of the population (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ICAR, 2015</xref>). Equally important is the contribution of agriculture to national food security. India achieved self-sufficiency in food production after the Green Revolution (GR), but retaining this success has been challenging due to the increasing scarcity of resources, including labour, water, energy, and rising costs of production (
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saharawat et al., 2010</xref>). Increased use of production inputs, such as mineral fertiliser, has made Indian agriculture more greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive. Agricultural production is a major emitter of GHGs, currently accounting for 18% of total GHG emissions in India (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">INCCA, 2010</xref>). Recent estimates report that global food production must increase by 70% to meet the projected food demand of the estimated 9 billion global population by 2050 (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CTA-CCAFS, 2011</xref>). With a population of âˆ¼1.3 billion, it is evident that the food system in India will be central to the global challenge of providing sufficient nutritious food while minimising GHG emissions. However, given the increasing population and shifting dietary patterns, GHG emissions from agricultural production in India are expected to change.
