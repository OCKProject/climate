<p class="p">Various methods exist to estimate GHGs from agriculture, ranging from simple Tier 1 methods (

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogle et al., 2013</xref>). Several tools and calculators have been developed for estimating GHG fluxes from farm activities and to support decision making in terms of identifying informed interventions. Here, we used a modified version of The Cool Farm Tool (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hillier et al., 2011</xref>), which integrates several empirical models into one tool for GHG estimation from farm activities. The tool recognises context-specific factors that influence GHG emissions such as pedo-climatic characteristics, production inputs, and other management practices at farm level. GHG emissions from livestock products are calculated using the comprehensive data from the 19th Livestock Census of the Government of India (
