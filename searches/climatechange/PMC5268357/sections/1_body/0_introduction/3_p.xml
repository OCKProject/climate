<p class="p">Quantifying GHG emissions associated with the production of food items in India is an important stage in quantifying GHG emissions associated with diets. It allows us to (i) identify variation in GHG emissions between typical dietary patterns within India; (ii) forecast the effect of changes in diets on GHG emissions; and (iii) identify options to minimise GHG emissions from food production, either through production-side changes or through dietary changes. For example, a number of countries have experienced a ‘nutrition transition’ associated with greater disposable incomes, urbanisation and globalisation. The transition is typified by increasing consumption of animal products, edible oils and sweetened beverages and decreasing consumption of cereals and pulses (

There is evidence that a similar trend is emerging among some population groups in India, although cultural preferences for lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets suggest that India’s experience will differ from other countries including China (
