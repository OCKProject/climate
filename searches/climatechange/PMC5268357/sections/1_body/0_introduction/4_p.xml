<p class="p">In India, the majority of agricultural GHG emissions occur at the primary production stage (
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pathak et al., 2010</xref>), and are generated through the production and use of agricultural inputs, farm machinery, soil disturbance, residue management and irrigation. These practices are used to increase yields and improve harvests. Due to its direct contribution to global GHG emissions, agriculture can also serve as an important climate change mitigation strategy (

 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2008</xref>), both by reducing GHG emissions to the atmosphere, and by sequestering atmospheric carbon into plant biomass and soil, though the role of some soil carbon sequestration practices for climate mitigation has been questioned (

Quantification of GHG emissions from the production of different food commodities helps farmers, researchers and policymakers to understand and manage these emissions, and identify mitigation responses that are consistent with the food security and economic development priorities of countries (
