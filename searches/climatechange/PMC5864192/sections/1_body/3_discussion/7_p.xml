<p id="Par29" class="p">Indeed, the functional significance of 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> diversity in the coral symbiosis is a critically important question to resolve if we are to understand the tolerance, adaptive capacity, and resilience of corals to a warming world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. We predict that a truly mutualistic symbiont would confer more resources to their host at a wider range of temperatures, whereas a commensal or parasite would retain more resources, particularly when conditions optimize their fitness [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Here we have observed the latter, where both an opportunistic and stress-tolerant symbiont and a purported low-light adapted mutualist have both become selfish as increasing temperatures favored the retention of resources while simultaneously increasing the respiratory demands of the holobiont. Future work should focus on how these patterns vary across the diversity of hostâ€“symbiont interactions, and hosts which vary in their trophic plasticity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In conclusion, we have experimentally shown that warming reduces the benefits of symbiosis when nutrients are non-limiting, which bolsters calls for nutrient pollution to be included with greenhouse gas emissions in climate change mitigation policies that aim to preserve coral reefs [
