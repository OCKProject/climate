<p id="Par26" class="p">Indeed, the most significant pattern we observed was the increased disparity between host and symbiont carbon and nitrogen assimilation at sub-bleaching temperatures. The difference in resource acquisition between the partners (ΔAP

 <sub class="sub">symbiont-host</sub> and ΔAP
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">symbiont-host</sub>) showed that the nitrogen gap increased by &gt;67% for all holobionts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c, d</xref>), and the carbon gap increased by 39% in shallow/A3 corals at 31 °C (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">symbiont-host</sub> at both temperatures could be interpreted as evidence of a stable mutualistic interaction, but we caution that such comparisons between symbiont types are confounded by the physiological adaptations to the deep and shallow forereef. Regardless, these differences were evident after just one day of incubation, and we predict that they would compound over time as
