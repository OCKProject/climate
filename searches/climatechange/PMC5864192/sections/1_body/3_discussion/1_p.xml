 <italic class="italic">O. faveolata</italic> sourced from the shallow and deep limits of their distribution to an ecologically relevant pre-bleaching warming experiment (+5 °C over 10 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] followed by a snapshot assessment of biogeochemical cycling including determinations of holobiont productivity (NPP), 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> carbon and nitrogen assimilation, and their subsequent translocation to the host. Previous studies focused on carbon metabolism in scleractinian corals under varied environmental conditions have reported a negative impact of temperature on

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. In contrast to those works, we observed that 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> metabolism was increased at sub-bleaching temperatures (31 °C) despite the fact that the 
 <italic class="italic">O. faveolata</italic> holobiont had a 60% reduction in NPP relative to controls (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). At the same time, photosynthesis (as measured by 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C fixation) was constant among deep/C7 corals and increased 14% among shallow/A3 corals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Thus, warming did not impair 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> photosynthesis but increased holobiont respiration which collectively caused a significant drop in holobiont NPP. Therefore, we conclude that warming induces greater energetic demands on the holobiont before 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> performance is compromised [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Moreover, this increase in respiration was associated with a significant (15%) drop in host carbon content, but not in 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic>, suggesting that hosts were bearing the costs of elevated respiration, perhaps by catabolizing lipid reserves. Although the host was still receiving fixed carbon from their symbionts, the overall loss of carbon in host tissues is evidence of passing a tipping point, where the benefits of symbiosis no longer exceeded the costs; a sign of a parasitic interaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. This confirms that during thermal anomalies coral hosts are rapidly taxed by unsustainable respiration that is not offset by photosynthetic benefits. A logical outcome is that a weakened host would be less capable to mitigate oxidative damage induced by a large and healthy symbiont burden [
