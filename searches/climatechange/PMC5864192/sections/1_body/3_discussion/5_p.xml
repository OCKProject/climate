<p id="Par27" class="p">We simulated such an increase based on the initial cell densities and final mitotic index of our incubated clones, which revealed an interesting pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). With just a 1% higher MI stimulated by heat and abundant resources, cell densities can theoretically increase in shallow corals by 25% in just 20 days, exceeding 5 million cells cm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. In deep corals with lower initial symbiont abundance, the time to reach a similar cell density may exceed 45 days. Such densities have been observed in 
 <italic class="italic">O. faveolata</italic> prior to bleaching events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] and may result from the synergistic effects of elevated nutrients and temperature. Indeed, 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> quickly assimilated nitrate and proportionally fewer organic derivatives were translocated to the host at elevated temperatures. Therefore, during weeks of heat accumulation preceding thermal bleaching events 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> can sequester significantly more nitrogen and energy than their hosts, which they can subsequently utilize for cell division [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. A logical next step is to link our observations with long-term changes in symbiont population densities (
 <italic class="italic">sensu</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]). Together, the observation of increased holobiont respiration and reduced carbon content (i.e., increased cost to the host) and unchanged translocation (i.e., no net change in cost to the symbiont) and increased resource storage and mitotic index (increased symbiont benefit) is indicative of the mutualism gradually shifting to parasitism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Moreover, these observations validate the assumption that symbiont resource hoarding precedes the proliferation of an unsustainable symbiont burden on the host as predicted by the Wooldridge model.
