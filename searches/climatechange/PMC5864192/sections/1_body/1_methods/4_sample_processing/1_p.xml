 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> were removed under a stream of deionized water using an airbrush powered by a SCUBA tank. Deionized water was chosen as a medium as it contains no confounding sources of carbon or nitrogen. The volume of blastate generated by airbrushing was noted, and the liquid was homogenized further using a tissue homogenizer. Three, 1 mL aliquots of this homogenate were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes for subsequent measurements, which included the following; (1) quantification of 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> cell density, (2) chlorophyll a concentration [chla], and (3) separation of host and symbiont fractions for 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> ITS2 genotyping and stable isotope analysis. The surface area (cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of each fragment was estimated from image analysis using ImageJ software (NIH). A 1 mL aliquot of homogenate from each sample was centrifuged to separate and clean the symbiont cells from the host tissues. A drop of Lugol’s iodine was added to facilitate visualization of cells. Cell counts were taken using a Bright-Line hemocytometer under a light microscope at 10 × magnification, and cell densities (cells cm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) were determined from the average of duplicate cell counts. [chla] was determined following extraction in 90% acetone and measuring the absorbance of the extract at 647 and 664 nm following the equations of Jeffrey and Humphrey [
