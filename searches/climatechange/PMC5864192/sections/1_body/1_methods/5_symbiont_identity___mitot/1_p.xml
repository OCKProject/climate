<p id="Par13" class="p">We identified the dominant 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> genotype present in our samples using direct sequencing of the ITS2 region of the nrDNA. Total genomic DNA was extracted from frozen 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> pellets using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit. The PCR followed the ITS2 “touchdown” protocol developed by LaJeunesse [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. Forward and reverse sequences were aligned and trimmed using Geneious 6.0 (Biomatters Ltd). Consensus sequences were used for BLAST searches to identify the closest match in NCBI GenBank. Sequences were cross-referenced with the GeoSymbio database [
