<p id="Par14" class="p">A second aliquot of the frozen cell suspension was loaded into a hemocytometer to count the total number of dividing 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> cells (doublets) relative to the total number of cells using a fluorescent microscope (80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Mitotic index (MI) was calculated as the quotient of the two measures, respectively. A total of 9426 individual cell observations were recorded across all samples from the post-incubation sampling. These data were used to simulate growth projections beyond the duration of the experiment (
