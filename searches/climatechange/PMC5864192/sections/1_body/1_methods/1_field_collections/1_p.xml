<p id="Par9" class="p">In November 2011, small pieces from apparently healthy colonies of 
 <italic class="italic">Orbicella faveolata</italic> were sampled from 2 locations near Carrie Bow Cay, Belize using a hammer and chisel. First, colonies from the shallow backreef area of Curlew Reef (16°47’24.14”N, 88°4’46.94”W) were sampled from 1–3 m depth (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10). These colonies exhibited a greenish-brown pigmentation. Subsequently, samples from the deeper forereef on the windward side of the Smithsonian field station (16°48’20.87”N, 88°4’40.46”W) were sampled down to the lower limit of the species distribution at ~15 m (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10). These colonies were distinctly gray-brown in appearance. Colonies exhibiting any sign of compromised health were excluded from sampling. All fragments were immediately transported to the Smithsonian field station in buckets of seawater, and fragmented into 3 equally sized pieces of ~4 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. One fragment was immediately frozen as an initial baseline sample. The remaining two clonal fragments were separated into two temperature treatments.
