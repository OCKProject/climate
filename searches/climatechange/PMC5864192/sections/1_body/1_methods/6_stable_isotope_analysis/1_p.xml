<p id="Par15" class="p">Frozen host and symbiont fractions were lyophilized, weighed into 4 × 6 mm Ag capsules and treated with ~10 μL of 6 N constant-boiling HCl (Pierce) to remove inorganic carbonates. The acid was evaporated in a hood for several hours and then dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C. Each capsule was rolled and combusted in a Carlo-Erba NC2500 Elemental Analyzer coupled to a Thermo Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a Conflo III open-split interface to measure

 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N,

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and the %N and %C of each sample. Samples were analyzed in separate runs, in order of anticipated enrichment (initials &gt; host &gt; symbiont). Analytical precision was determined using an in-house acetanilide standard (ACET; 70%C, 10%N). Precision of initials (nat. abundance) was less than ±0.1 and 0.2‰ for

 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N and

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, respectively. Precision of standards measured with enriched samples was ±4.5 and 1.4‰, respectively. Enriched values are reported as atom% of the heavy isotope (AP
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N &amp; AP
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C), which is calculated by the count of the heavy isotope relative to the total number of atoms of N or C in the sample.
