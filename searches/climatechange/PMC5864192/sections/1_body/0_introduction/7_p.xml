<p id="Par8" class="p">In addition to this correlative field observation, a recently developed theoretical biogenergetic simulation model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] was found to support the mechanistic bleaching predictions of the Wooldridge model. However, targeted experimental studies that directly test/validate the Wooldridge model are currently lacking. Only indirect observations are available for discrimination. For example, at the “front end” of the model, studies have shown that 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> growth is stimulated by exogenous nitrogen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. At the “back end” of the model, studies have confirmed that nitrogen has a direct effect on coral health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], and that a large symbiont burden can make corals more vulnerable to bleaching and disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Together, these bodies of evidence suggest that symbiont benefits are not synonymous with host benefits and that parity is lost under times of stress; an indication of the unsustainable cost of symbiosis. Yet, none of these studies have examined the capacity for symbionts to cheat or parasitize their hosts which requires a focus on metabolism and nutrient assimilation and translocation during periods of stress. Here we ask the question, do 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> become parasites at elevated temperatures?
