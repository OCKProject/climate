<p id="Par4" class="p">Nutritional exchanges are critical to understanding the performance of a symbiosis under stress. For corals, there are two simplified perspectives on the relative importance of mechanisms within the holobiont that underpin and precede the bleaching response. A “host-centered” perspective reveals that host species’ capacity for heterotrophy and lipid storage confers thermal tolerance, bleaching resistance, and post-bleaching resilience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In sum, hosts that can store more energy and/or obtain nutrition from heterotrophic sources during thermal stress are more likely to survive bleaching events. A second perspective is “symbiont-centered“ and is based on thermal stress impairing photosynthetic performance of 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> by damaging the photosynthetic architecture including the thylakoid membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. When combined with 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic>’s propensity for photorespiration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>], damaged membranes produce reactive oxygen species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] that induce host apoptosis, immune responses and ultimately, symbiont expulsion. However, some 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> tolerate temperatures exceeding 34 °C 
 <italic class="italic">in hospite</italic> or even after expulsion (far higher than most corals’ bleaching threshold) and exhibit enhanced growth rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. These exceptional observations challenge the theory that 
 <italic class="italic">Symbiodinium</italic> are universally impaired at high temperatures and suggest that other factors in addition to photodamage are involved in the bleaching outcome.
