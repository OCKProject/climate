<p class="p">The study adapted and extended the questionnaire items used in 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Spence et al. (2012)</xref> to measure psychological distance. The original measure contained 10 items in total: five measured hypothetical distance, one measured temporal distance, and spatial and social distance were each measured by two items. The questions used different response scales and labels. In the present study, we created 18 items measured on a common response scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (
 <italic class="italic">strongly agree</italic>), with greater endorsement reflecting greater psychological distance. The four dimensions of psychological distance specified by 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trope and Liberman (2010)</xref> - namely temporal distance, spatial distance, social distance and hypothetical distance - were each measured by four items. Additionally, because one’s perceived temporal and hypothetical distance may vary by location and subject, items were created to reflect temporal 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> spatial distance, and temporal 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> social distance (and the same for hypothetical distance). An example of a question is “Climate change will not change my life, or my family’s lives anytime soon” (temporal and social distance).
