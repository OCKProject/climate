 <result pre="isomorphic relationship which may not hold in the domain of" exact="climate" post="change. Accordingly, the primary objective of Study 1 is"/>
 <result pre="measuring both constructs independently, in addition to their relationship with" exact="climate" post="change engagement. Such work is necessary to disentangle the"/>
 <result pre="role of psychological distance and construal level, as cognitions of" exact="climate" post="change, and as predictors of climate change engagement. To"/>
