In parallel, NO is combined with GSH to form nitrosoglutathione GSNO. GSNO regulates many enzymatic activities by the posttranslational modification of cysteine residues through S-Nitrosylation. NOX and CAT activities are inhibited by S-nitrosylation, whereas APX is either activated or inhibited by S-nitrosylation. NO also inhibits APX by binding to heme group. GSNO is degraded by GSNOR, which could be inhibited by H

Reduced ASC is generated by MDHAR and DHAR, using GSH as electron donor. Both enzymes are inhibited by S-nitrosylation. Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) may be originated by NO and
