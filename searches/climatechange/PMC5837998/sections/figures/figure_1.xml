   <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, and NO) have both natural and anthropogenic origin, contributing to greenhouse effect. Short-term effects of GHG increase is mainly CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> rise, that activates photosynthesis (PS) and inhibits stomatal opening (SO). Long-term effects of GHG increase are extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts, heat. All of them induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. Nitric oxide (NO) could alleviate oxidative stress by scavenging ROS and/or regulating the antioxidant system (AS). GHG and volatile organic compounds (VOC) react in presence of sunlight (E#) to give tropospheric O

   <sub class="sub">3</sub> is prejudicial for life, stratospheric O
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> is beneficial, because filters harmful UV-B radiation. The size of arrows are representative of the GHG concentration.
