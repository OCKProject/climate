<p class="p">In this context, plants have also developed a tight interaction between ROS and NO as a mechanism to reduce the deleterious consequences of these ROS-induced oxidative injuries. NO orchestrates a wide range of mechanisms leading to the preservation of redox homeostasis in plants. Consequently, NO at low concentration is considered a broad-spectrum anti-stress molecule (
