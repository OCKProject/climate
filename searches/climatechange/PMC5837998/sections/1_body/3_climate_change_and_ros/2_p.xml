The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, Î²-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondrias and chloroplasts (

Hence, higher plants have evolved in the presence of ROS and have acquired pathways to protect themselves from its toxicity. Plant antioxidant system (AS) includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments (reviewed by
