<p class="p">Climate change is a multidimensional and simultaneous variation in duration, frequency and intensity of parameters like temperature and precipitation, altering the seasons and life on the Earth. In this scenario, plant species with increased adaptive plasticity will be better equipped to tolerate changes in the frequency of extreme weather events. GHG are one of the forces driving climate change. However, CO
