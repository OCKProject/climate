<p class="p">Here we will not discuss plants capacity of adaptation to novel environmental conditions when considering large scales and long-term periods. Ecosystems are being affected by climate change at all levels (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine), and it was already reported that species are under evolutionary adaptation to human-caused climate change (for a review see 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Scheffers et al., 2016</xref>). Migration and plasticity are two biological mechanisms to cope with these changes. Data indicate that each population of a species has limited tolerance to sharp climate variations, and they could migrate to find more favorable environments. Habitat fragmentation limits plant movement, being other big threat for adaptation (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leimu et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the fact that individual plants are immobile, plant populations move when seeds are dispersed, resulting in differences in the general distribution of the species (
