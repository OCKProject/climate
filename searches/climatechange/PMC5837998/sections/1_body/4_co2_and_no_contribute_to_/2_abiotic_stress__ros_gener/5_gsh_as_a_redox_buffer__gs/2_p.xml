 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and can react with NO to form the nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) derivative. GSNO is an intracellular NO reservoir. It is also a vehicle of NO throughout the cell and organs, spreading NO biological function. GSNO is the largest low-molecular-mass S-nitrosothiol (SNO) in plant cells (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corpas et al., 2013</xref>). GSNO metabolism and its reaction with other molecules involve S-nitrosylation and S-transnitrosation which consist of the binding of a NO molecule to a cysteine residue in proteins. Thioredoxin produces protein denitrosylation (
