<p class="p">Glutathione (GSH) is a small peptide with the sequence Î³-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine that has a cell redox homeostatic impact in most plant tissues. It is a soluble small thiol considered a non-enzymatic antioxidant. It exists in the reduced (GSH) or oxidized state (GSSG), in which two GSH molecules are joined by a disulfide bond (

GSH alleviates oxidative damages in plants generated by abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, higher, low temperature, and heavy metals. GSH is precursor of phytochelatins, polymers that chelate toxic metals and transport them to the vacuole (

Moreover, GSH has a role in the detoxification of ROS both directly, interacting with them, or indirectly, participating of enzymatic pathways. GSH is involved in glutathionylation, a posttranslational modification that causes a mixed disulfide bond between a Cys residue and GSH.
