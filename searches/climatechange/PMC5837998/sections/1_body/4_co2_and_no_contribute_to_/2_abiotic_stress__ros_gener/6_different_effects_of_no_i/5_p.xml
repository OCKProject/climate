<p class="p">Several antioxidant enzymes have been identified as target of S-nitrosylation, resulting in a change of their biological activity (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Romero-Puertas et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fares et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, NO reinforces recalcitrant seed desiccation tolerance in 
 <italic class="italic">Antiaris toxicaria</italic> by activating the ascorbate-glutathione cycle through S-nitrosylation to control H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> accumulation. Desiccation treatment reduced the level of S-nitrosylated APX, GR, and DHAR proteins. Instead, NO gas exposure activated them by S-nitrosylation (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bai et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, APX was S-nitrosylated at Cys32 during saline stress and biotic stress, enhancing its enzymatic activity (

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, auxin-induced denitrosylation of cytosolic APX provoked inhibition of its activity, followed by an increase of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and the consequent lateral root formation in Arabidopsis (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Correa-Aragunde et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, an inhibitory impact of S-nitrosylation on APX activity was also reported during programmed cell death in Arabidopsis (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">de Pinto et al., 2013</xref>). CAT was identified to be S-nitrosylated in a proteomic study of isolated peroxisomes (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ortega-Galisteo et al., 2012</xref>). A decrease of S-nitrosylated CAT under Cd treatment was reported. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated a reversible inhibitory effect of APX and CAT activities by NO binding to the Fe of the heme cofactor (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown, 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clark et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, NOXs have been involved in plant defense, development, hormone biosynthesis and signaling (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marino et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas S-nitrosylation did not affect SOD activities, nitration inhibited Mn-SOD1, Fe-SOD3, and CuZn-SOD3 activity to different degrees (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holzmeister et al., 2015</xref>). SOD isoforms could also regulate endogenous NO availability by competing for the common substrate,

 </inline-formula>, and it was demonstrated that bovine SOD may release NO from GSNO (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al., 1999</xref>). When GSNO is decomposed by GSNOR, it produces GSSG. GSNOR is also regulated by NO. 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frungillo et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that NO-derived from nitrate assimilation in Arabidopsis inhibited GSNOR1 by S-nitrosylation, preventing GSNO degradation. They proposed that (S)NO controls its own generation and scavenging by modulating nitrate assimilation and GSNOR1 activity. It was also shown that chilling treatment in poplar increased S-nitrosylation of NR, along with a significant decrease of its activity (
