 </bold> is a simplified diagram that illustrates the main oxidative and nitrosative effects that modulate the activities of key cell components, thus maintaining cell redox balance. Note the feedback and positive-negative regulatory processes occurring in the main pathways. They involve posttranslational modifications that activate and inhibit the components involved in cell antioxidant system.
