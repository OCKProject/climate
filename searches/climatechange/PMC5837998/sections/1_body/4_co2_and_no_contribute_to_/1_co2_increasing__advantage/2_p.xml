<p class="p">The most important photosynthetic enzyme is the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO). Rubisco is located in mesophyll cells of C3 plants, in direct contact with the intercellular air space linked to the atmosphere by epidermal stomatal pores. Photosynthesis increases at high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, because Rubisco is not CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> saturated and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> inhibits the oxygenation reactions and photorespiration (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Long et al., 2006</xref>). However, long-term high concentration of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may down regulate Rubisco activity because ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is not regenerated. Hexokinase (HXK), a sensor of extreme photosynthate, may participate in the down regulation of Rubisco concentration (
