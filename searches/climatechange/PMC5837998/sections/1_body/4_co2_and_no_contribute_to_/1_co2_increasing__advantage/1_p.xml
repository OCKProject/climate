<p class="p">Increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was suggested to have a “fertilization” effect, because crops would increase their photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in response to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This belief was supported by studies performed in greenhouses, laboratory controlled-environment chambers, and transparent field chambers, where emitted CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may be held back and readily controlled (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase is probably dependent on genetic and environmental factors, and the duration of the study (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al. (2015)</xref> concluded that augmented CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> normally increases photosynthesis in C3 species such as rice, soybean and wheat. On the other hand, they pointed out that a negative feedback of photosynthesis could take place in augmented CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, as a result of overload of chemical and reactive generated substrates, leading to an imbalance in the sink:source carbon ratio. Moreover, the energetic cost of carbohydrate exportation increases in elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> level.
