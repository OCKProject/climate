 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AbdElgawad et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that drought suppresses plant growth, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and promotes in all species the synthesis of osmolytes and antioxidants. Instead, oxidative damage is more markedly observed in legumes than in grasses. In general, warming amplifies drought consequences. In contrast, augmented CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> diminishes stress impact. Reduction in photosynthesis and chlorophyll, as a result of drought and elevated temperature, were avoided by high CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Normally, a reduced impact of oxidative stress is due to decreased photorespiration and diminished NOX activity. In legumes, a rise in levels of antioxidant molecules (flavonoids and tocopherols) contribute as well to the stress mitigation caused by augmented CO
