<p class="p">In C4 crops, such as maize and sorghum, the elevated concentration of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> inside the bundle sheath cells could prevent a large increase of Rubisco activity at higher atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and, thereby, photosynthetic activity is not augmented. However, at high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels, the water status of C4 plants under drought conditions is improved, increasing photosynthesis and biomass accumulation (
