 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumari et al. (2015)</xref> assessed the impact of various levels of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, ambient (382 ppm) and augmented (570 ppm), and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, ambient (50 ppb) and augmented (70 ppb) on the potato physiological and biochemical responses (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic>). They observed that augmented CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> cut down O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> uptake, enhanced carbon assimilation, and curbed oxidative stress. Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> also mitigated the noxious effect of high O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> on photosynthesis.
