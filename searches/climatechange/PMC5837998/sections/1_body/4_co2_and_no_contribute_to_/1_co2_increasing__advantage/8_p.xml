<p class="p">Although some molecular mechanisms underpinning CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> actions are unknown, the results presented highlight the importance of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as a regulator that mitigates the potential climate change-induced deleterious consequences in plants. Recent reports suggest that some CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-associated responses may be mediated by NO.
