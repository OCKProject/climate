<p class="p">The oxidative pathway produces NO through the oxidation of organic compounds such as polyamines, hydroxylamine and arginine. In animals, NOS catalyzes arginine oxidation to citrulline and NO. Many efforts were made to find the arginine-dependent NO formation in plants, as well as of plant NOS (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foresi et al., 2010</xref>) led to high-throughput bioinformatic analysis in plant genomes. This study shows that NOS homologs were not present in over 1,000 genomes of higher plants analyzed, but only in few photosynthetic microorganisms, such as algae and diatoms (
