<p class="p">Two major pathways for NO production have been described in plants: the reductive and the oxidative pathways. The reductive pathway involves the reduction of nitrite to NO by NR under conditions such as acidic pH, anoxia, or an increase in nitrite levels (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meyer et al., 2005</xref>). NR-dependent NO formation has been involved in processes such as stomatal closure, root development, germination and immune responses. In plants, nitrite may also be reduced enzymatically by other molybdenum enzymes such as, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase, in animals (
