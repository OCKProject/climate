<p class="p">Nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG. During the last century, their global emissions have rised, due mainly to human intervention (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). The soil emits both N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and NO. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is a strong GHG, whereas NO contributes indirectly to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> synthesis. As GHG, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is potentially 300 times stronger than CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Once in the stratosphere, the former catalyzes the elimination of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O concentrations are climbing up due mainly to microbial activity in nitrogen (N)-rich soils related with agricultural and fertilization practices (
