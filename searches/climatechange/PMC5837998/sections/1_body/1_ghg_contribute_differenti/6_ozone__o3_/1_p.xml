<p class="p">Ozone (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) is mainly found in the stratosphere, but a little amount is generated in the troposphere. Stratospheric ozone (namely the ozone layer) is formed naturally by chemical reactions involving solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Solar UV radiation breaks one O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> molecule, producing two oxygen atoms (2 O). Then, each of these highly reactive atoms combines with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to produce an (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) molecule. Almost 99% of the Sunâ€™s medium-frequency UV light (from about 200 to 315 nm wavelength) is absorbed by the (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) layer. Otherwise, they could damage exposed life forms near the Earth surface
