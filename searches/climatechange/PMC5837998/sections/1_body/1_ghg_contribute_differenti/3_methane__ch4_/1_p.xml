 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 Î¼mol.mol
