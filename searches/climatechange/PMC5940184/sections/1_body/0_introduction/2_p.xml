<p class="p">Projected changes in climate will directly impact the dairy cow, mainly as a result of heat stress, but also through the indirect effects climate change will have on pasture yield and quality, and the length of the growing and grazing season [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Farm animals have specific thermoneutral zones, which are the ranges of ambient temperatures in which body heat production is in equilibrium with body heat loss, when there is no need for additional warming (e.g. shivering) or cooling (e.g. sweating and panting) mechanisms or behaviours (e.g. seeking shelter). Abiotic factors that affect these are relative humidity (RH), wind speed and the intensity of solar radiation. Ambient temperatures (T) higher than the upper critical T of the thermoneutral zone will result in heat stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], leading to a net decrease in milk production in cows [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and thus milk loss from dairy farms [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The need to predict both heat stress and corresponding milk losses led to the development of the temperature humidity index (THI), which combines effects of T and RH associated with the level of thermal stress. An animal is considered to be heat stressed with THI above specific thresholds (THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub>). Several THI calculation methods and THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> have been proposed in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] but there is no single standard procedure for calculating THI from T and RH data. Once a THI method is defined, empirical equations can be used to quantify the impact of heat stress on milk yield reductions.
