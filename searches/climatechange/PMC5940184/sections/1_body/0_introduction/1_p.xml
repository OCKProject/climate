<p class="p">Global consumption of milk is increasing in most parts of the world, driven by population and income growth, urbanization and changes in diets [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The UK has approximately 1.6 million dairy cows, producing about 14.6 billion litres of milk per year, making it the 10th largest milk producing country in the world. The value of UK milk production is around Â£4.6 billion per year, approximately 18% of gross agricultural economic output [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The average yield per dairy cow is over 7500 litres per annum [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>].Like other agricultural sectors, milk production is influenced by the weather and climate. These factors determine what feed crops can be grown, and the availability of grass for grazing. A large proportion of UK dairy farming is based on cows grazing pastures for approximately six months of the year [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. During the grazing period, dairy cows are more exposed to environmental factors and are thus likely to be more vulnerable to climate change than cows that are housed, especially if we consider that cooling devices can be used as a relief for cattle.
