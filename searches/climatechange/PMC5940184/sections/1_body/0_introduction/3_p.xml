<p class="p">As heat stress is likely to be a direct effect of climate change on dairy cows, the overall aim of the present study was to apply a modular approach to investigate the potential outcomes. In the first analysis, we considered only the impact of heat stress on milk losses from dairy cows, assuming no mitigation measures are taken. We recognise that other factors, such as cow fertility, disease and mortality rate [

The specific objectives of this study were: 1) to predict future changes of heat stress-related milk loss of dairy cows in the UK in a spatially-explicit manner, 2) to estimate the uncertainty associated with calculated milk losses, 3) to project the possible economic consequences of milk loss due to heat stress, and 4) to assess differences between milk loss calculation methods.
