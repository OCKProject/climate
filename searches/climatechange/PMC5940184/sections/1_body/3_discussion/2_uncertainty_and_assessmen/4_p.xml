<p class="p">In conclusion, we have developed a modelling framework to estimate potential effects of climate change on milk production of pasture-based dairy cattle using the UK as an example. We estimated relatively low AML that can be mitigated by implementing current practices for heat stress relief of cows on pasture. However, we detected specific regions of current dairy farming importance, where AML were projected to reach 17% of current annual milk yield in extreme years due to an increased frequency, duration and severity of heat waves. For these regions, the application of sophisticated technologies should be implemented to reduce projected losses. The choice of different THI threshold values made a large difference to projected milk loss. This observation alone emphasises the need for more intensive research seeking to determine the most biologically relevant THI
