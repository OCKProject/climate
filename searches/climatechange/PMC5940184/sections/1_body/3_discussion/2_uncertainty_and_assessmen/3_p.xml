<p class="p">The sub-daily method [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] is sensitive because it can detect days with relatively small heat stress loads, when the overall THI is below the threshold. This approach can quantify the load of heat stress rather than the average heat stress in estimating the extent and cumulative severity of heat stress within days. Thus, it is important in regions with temperate climates to quantify animal responses at acute stressful events, such as summer heat waves, because these responses will depend on the magnitude and duration of the heat wave [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Therefore, the combination of daily and sub-daily methods was used to represent a more biologically appropriate way of estimating milk loss from dairy cows due to heat stress. Indeed, the mixed “heat wave” methods (M5 and M6) are closer to current estimation of milk loses during heat waves [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and probably provided a more realistic outcome for the future. The adequacy of the heat wave-based mixed method is also supported by the fact that its results match with that of the ensemble mean of all investigated methods.
