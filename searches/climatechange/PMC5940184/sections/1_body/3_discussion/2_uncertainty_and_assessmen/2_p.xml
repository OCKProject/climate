<p class="p">In general, THI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is used for the sub-daily methods whereas THI
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> is used for the daily step methods. This methodological difference explains why there was a greater difference in the projected number of days of heat stress between the daily and sub-daily methods of calculation for the 2010s compared to the 2090s. The increased T towards the end of this century increased the number of days when THI
