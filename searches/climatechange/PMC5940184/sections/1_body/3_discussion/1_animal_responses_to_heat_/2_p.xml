<p class="p">British dairy farming is heavily reliant on pasture use [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. A number of relatively low cost adaptation measures could help minimize adverse consequences of heat stress in dairy cows. The provision of natural or artificial shade is the most efficient and inexpensive way to reduce heat accumulation from solar radiation, leading to reduced signs of heat load, rectal temperatures and hyperchloraemia [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Shade provision can lead to increased milk yield of pasture-based cows [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Recently, a field study was conducted to investigate the effects of the amount of shade on 8 Holstein-Friesian pasture-based herds in New Zealand for 2 consecutive summers. It was reported that providing more shade increased the proportion of animals within the herd that used this resource and reduced respiratory signs of heat load [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Similarly, when shade was provided to Holstein cows on pasture using young trees to support shade cloths, it tempered the effects of increased THI by reducing rectal temperature, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of liver metabolism [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Although these figures maybe lower for outdoor cattle due to the availability of fresh forage with a high water content the distance between available water and the grazing area should allow at least twice daily visits by the cattle [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Nutritional management might also provide a cost-effective mechanism to support heat-stressed cattle. This might include supplementation of rumen-protected proteins and fats, electrolytes, and specific feed additives [
