<p class="p">A relatively low rate of occurrence of heat stress in UK dairy cows in the current climate (2010s) was estimated by all the methods used in the present study. Similarly, Dunn et al (2014) and Hill and Wall (2015) reported an average of one day of heat stress conditions per year [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However this can increase to five days when years with heat waves are considered [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, these studies failed to detect any significant milk yield reductions due to heat stress in 2003 and 2006, when strong heat waves were recorded [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Our analysis suggests that the average AML in regions with high heat stresses (e.g. South East England) is 40 kg/cow. However, this reduction was calculated from total days of heat stress conditions without taking into account the fact that these days were not consecutive. Cattle initially respond to mild heat stress by sweating, panting, drinking more, and seeking shade when possible. At higher temperatures cows reduce their feed intake, which leads to a fall in milk production. When heat stress is temporary, lasting only one or two days, it is possible that cows will not reduce their feed intake or their milk production [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that under current UK climatic conditions there are no evident milk yield penalties even when model simulations predict small decreases. By the end of the century, the average UK daily temperature was projected to be 4°C higher than the current temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). This will result in a projected increase in the number of heat stress periods across all the regions of the UK. The corresponding AML was estimated to be 105 kg/cow if no steps are taken to adapt to changing climate conditions and UK dairy cattle remain the same in terms of genetic merit and heat tolerance. Even though this cannot be categorised as severe heat stress conditions, a noteworthy AML was estimated. This estimation assumes no difference in cows kept indoors and outdoors because it is not possible to differentiate between farm types in each grid cell. However, it is well established that temperatures in dairy barns are 3 to 6°C higher than those measured outdoors [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and the projected temperature and relative humidity values our calculations used were for outdoors. Thus, unless some form of indoor temperature management is adopted, actual AML may be even higher than calculated here for some farm types.
