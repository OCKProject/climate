<p class="p">Although average UK temperature increases are estimated to have relatively minor impact in many regions, our analysis predicted that heat waves could lead to severe heat stress in dairy cows with projected AMLs greater than 1,200 kg/cow by the end of the century in high-risk areas. These areas are Wales, South West, South East England, and East of England, although potential total milk losses in Wales and the South West are likely to be higher than in the South East and East of England because of the higher concentrations of dairy cattle in the west of the UK [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This finding is in accordance with other studies that reported increased parasite risk in specific UK regions due to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The increased occurrence of heat waves worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and in the UK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) is expected to cause additional heat stress in dairy cows, as reflected to our analysis where extreme years show a correlation between a high frequency of heat waves and the maximum AML. The current frequency of 1–2 heat waves per decade may increase to 3–5 by the end of the century, which is much lower than currently observed, for example, in Italy (5 heat waves per year [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]). However, the length of a heat wave is projected to reach 8 to 15 days similar to that currently reported for Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In such conditions, heat stress is correlated not only with increased milk loss, but also with increased cattle mortality [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and culling due to reduced fertility [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In these cases, simple adaptation measures, such as the provision of shade, may not be sufficient to mitigate negative heat stress effects on milk production. However, current technologies used in other, hotter, parts of the world (e.g. fans and water misting) could be applied to British dairy farming, which is already changing towards intensive indoor systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], to care for dairy cows during these heat waves [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Moreover, breeding for increased heat tolerance is a potential strategy to help mitigate negative effects of increased frequency of heat waves [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This can be beneficial for maintaining pasture-based systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Even though the main strategy to date has been crossing Holstein cows with local breeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], genomic predictions for heat tolerance of Holstein cows have been identified suggesting that genomic selection may accelerate breeding for heat tolerance [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In addition, changing the location of farming operations is a current practice used to address economic challenges worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Even though there is little indication that movement of dairy farming operations is a feasible strategy to decrease the risks of environmental challenges in the UK [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], the increased use of regions with little or no prediction of conditions leading to heat stress (e.g. Scotland) may provide an additional adaptation measure for UK dairy farming depending on the availability of pasture. At the end of this century, heat stress-related annual income losses of average size dairy farms in the most affected regions may vary between £2000-£6000 and £6000-£14000 in average and extreme years respectively. Armed with these figures, farmers can easily create preliminary financial plans to assess the pay-offs of possible mitigation options such as planting trees or installing shades. It is likely that the hotter UK areas will see a reduction in cattle numbers, perhaps with increases in other areas, e.g. further north or at higher altitudes, if cropping and grazing options change to become more favourable for cows.
