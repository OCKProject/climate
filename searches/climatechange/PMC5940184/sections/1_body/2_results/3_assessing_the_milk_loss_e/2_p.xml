<p class="p">The exponential increase in milk loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) was due to the fact that the number of days affected by heat stress (THI
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>&gt;THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub>) was projected to increase exponentially in the future irrespective of which method was selected to calculate THI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). However, there is a linear increase in the number of days with heat stress that was only predicted using the sub-daily step methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). On days with THI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>&gt;THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> and THI
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>&lt;THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub>, sub-daily methods suggest that milk loss could be as high as 2.9 kg/cow/d whereas the daily step methods would predict no milk loss. Since the number of these partially heat-stress affected days is projected to increase linearly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), the difference between the sub-daily step and daily step methods is also projected to increase in the future. Currently (in the 2010s), the daily step methods would indicate that the number of heat stressed days is approximately 20% of those calculated using the sub-daily methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Due to the projected increase in temperature, the difference between the daily and sub-daily methods will decline, but daily methods will still only capture around 50% of the days predicted by the sub-daily methods as heat stressed. However, the frequency and length of heat waves is predicted to increase in the UK throughout the century (
