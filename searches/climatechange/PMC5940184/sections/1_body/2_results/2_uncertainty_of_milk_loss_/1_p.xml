<p class="p">Except for the 2030s, the CV associated with the milk loss calculation method effect was consistently higher than that associated with methods of calculating climate projection and inter-annual variability for the investigated future time slots (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197076.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Despite the considerable inter-annual variability of the AML, as well as the large differences between the climate projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), the arbitrary selection of a milk loss calculation method may introduce similar, or even greater, uncertainty in milk loss projections. Toward the end of this century, the effect of all three calculation factors gradually decreased, which reflects the fact that the average of AMLs increases exponentially. The UK average of the AMLs in the 2090s is projected to be 4.6 times greater than the baseline, as a result of more frequent and more pronounced periods of heat stress. However, the SD of the AML values was calculated to increase linearly, so that the UK average of the SDs in the 2090s was 3.0 times greater than that of the baseline.
