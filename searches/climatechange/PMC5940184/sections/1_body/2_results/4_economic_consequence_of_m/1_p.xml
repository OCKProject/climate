<p class="p">Compared to current the UK average annual dairy farm business income (£80,000) the heat stress-related income loss was projected to be less than 7% even in the most affected southern UK regions towards the end of the century (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197076.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In extreme years, however, the income loss may reach as high as 18% in South East England, though the dairy cow density in this region is relatively low. South West England is the most vulnerable to climate change as this is the region which is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore high potential heat stress-related milk loss. Estimated heat stress-related annual income loss of the region may reach £13.4M in average years, and £33.8M in extreme years (at current values), by the end of the century if no action is taken to mitigate it.
