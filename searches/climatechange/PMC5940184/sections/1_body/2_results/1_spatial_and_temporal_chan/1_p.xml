 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. shows the trends of temperature changes in the UK for the summer period (April-September) defined by the SCPs. As a result of these, the AML per cow values varied between regions across the UK. The average current AML was calculated to be around 1 kg/cow in the north of the UK while in the south it may reach 40 kg/cow. This difference is expected to increase under future climate scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). By the end of the century, dairy cattle in large portions of Scotland and Northern Ireland will experience the same level of heat stress as cattle in southern-England today. In South East England the average AML was projected to exceed 170 kg/cow based on the average of the 18 investigated methods. The projected AML values were highly dependent on the selected threshold THI. Changing THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> from 72 to 68 resulted in an increase of projected AML from 80 to 320 kg/cow for the most affected regions in the South (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197076.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The average AML predicted for the 2090s was relatively low (2.4% of the annual milk yield) even for the South East England region. On the other hand, an unlikely extreme event (once in every 10 years) would mean the maximum AML may be close to 600 kg/cow (8.0% of the annual milk yield) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197076.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). At the most extreme, in the ‘hottest’ 25 km grid cells (around the Greater London area) in the hottest years, AML may exceed 1300 kg/cow which is 17% of the potential current mean milk production. The uncertainty (CV) of the AML was lower in the South than in the North due to the fact that the AML values were considerably lower in the North. The uncertainty is expected to decline slowly during the century but the North-South difference will remain constant according to the projections. The decrease in the coefficient of variation was the result of the average of AMLs increasing more rapidly than their standard deviation.
