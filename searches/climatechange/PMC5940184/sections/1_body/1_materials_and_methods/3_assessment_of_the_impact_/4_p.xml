<p class="p">The characteristics of trends in AML and number of heat stress days from years 2010–2100 were investigated by regression analysis in STATISTICA 12.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. An example grid cell in South-East England (centroid: 51.0°N, 0.7°W) was selected to represent an area that climate change is projected to cause considerable changes compared to the baseline, and detailed temporal changes of AML and number of heat stress days were calculated for this cell. Linear and exponential trends of these data were considered, with the best regression model fits being determined using the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the normalised root-mean-square error (NRMSE = 100×RMSE/MEAN, where RMSE and MEAN were the root-mean-square error and the average of the calculated values, respectively) of the fitted curves. The curve type providing the better statistical indicators was used to characterise the trend in question. The significance of the difference between the milk loss projections was tested using Mann–Whitney U test in STATISTICA.
