<p class="p">A detailed assessment of the sub-daily (M1-2) and daily (M3-4) methods was performed to reveal the most important cause of the differences between the results of the two method types. This analysis was carried out using all three THI thresholds (68, 70 and 72) but only the results obtained with THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> = 70 were presented for a selected grid cell. The number of days affected by heat stress (THI
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> &gt; THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub>) as well as the number of days characterised by THI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> &gt; THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> and THI
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> &lt; THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> was determined for each grid cell and for every year of the 2010â€“2100 period. The latter indicates the days when the daily step methods predict no heat-stress and no milk loss while sub-daily step methods predict a considerable milk loss. In general, conditions when THId &gt; THIthr represent greater severe heat stress potential than at other times.
