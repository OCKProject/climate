<p class="p">The annual milk loss per cow (AML, kg/cow/y) value was used to assess the projected impact of climate change on milk production and was calculated using each model as the summation of predicted daily losses for each year. The 11 climate projections and the 18 calculation methods resulted in 1980 AML values for every grid cell for every decade from the 2010s to the 2090s. The uncertainty of the calculated AML values was characterised with the coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation (SD) divided by the mean) for each grid cell. The uncertainty of the AML figures originates from three major sources: 1) Year effect: caused by the interannual variability of temperature and humidity patterns within a decade; 2) Climate Projection effect: caused by the differences in the climate model projections; 3) Method effect: caused by the differences in the milk loss calculation methods. The contribution of these three factors to the overall uncertainty of AML was quantified as follows: 1) Year effect: for every year the average of AMLs obtained for each climate projection and method combination was calculated (average of 198 values). Then, the coefficient of variation was calculated across the years (CV of 10 values). 2) Climate Projection effect: for every climate projection the average of AMLs obtained for each year and method combination was calculated (average of 180 values). Then, the coefficient of variation was calculated across the climate projections (CV of 11 values). 3) Method effect: for every method the average of AMLs obtained for each year and climate projection combination was calculated (average of 110 values). Then, the coefficient of variation was calculated across the methods (CV of 18 values).</p>
