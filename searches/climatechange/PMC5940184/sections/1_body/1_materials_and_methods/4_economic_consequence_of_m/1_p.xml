<p class="p">The financial aspect of heat stress related milk loss was estimated for each of the NUTS-1 regions of the UK. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) system is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of EU member countries for statistical purposes [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The regional annual milk loss (RAML) values (kg/cow) were calculated by aggregating the AML values of the grid cells belonging to the particular NUTS1 region. According to a DairyCo report [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], approximately 81% of a herd is potentially affected by heat stress as its lactating period overlaps with the summer months. The average herd sizes (AHS) of the NUTS1 regions were retrieved from the AHDB database [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Numbers of cows per dairy farm have steadily increased during the past 20 years with a rate of 3.5 cow/y across the whole of the UK, and thus the income loss (IL, £/y) of a typical dairy farm (having an AHS, at pasture) was calculated for each NUTS-1 region according to two scenarios. Scenario_1 postulated no more centralisation of herds, thus stagnating AHS (constant AHS) and Scenario_2 postulated a continuous growth of AHS with a rate that was observed in the past two decades (increasing AHS). As the farm-gate milk price fluctuates around £0.3 per litre and does not show any specific long-term trend [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], the income loss of a typical UK dairy farm can be estimated with the following equation:
