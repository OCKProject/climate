<p class="p">In the framework of the UKCP09 project [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], an 11-member data ensemble was created using 11 variants of a regional climate model (RCM, called HadRM3), based on the medium emission scenario (A1B) with data produced on a daily time scale at a 25 km spatial resolution [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The spatially coherent projections (SCPs) were generated by applying scaling factors to the RCM data, in a way that the changes in the SCP ensemble were linearly related to changes in global temperature. A time scaling method [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] was used to incorporate the uncertainty in global temperature from emission scenario, carbon cycle, sulphur cycle and ocean physics, into the RCM data, making the spread of the scaled RCM data consistent with the overall spread in the probabilistic (General Circulation Model based) projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The SCP ensemble was designed to be used for trend analysis as the RCM provides continuous projections for the 1950–2100 period. The SCPs used in this study explore an even wider range of climate change than the General Circulation Model driven RCM projections of the UKCP09 but still include 11 equally plausible projections of future climate conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The grid of climate projections covers the inland territory of the UK with 440 25×25 km cells. For each grid cell, 11 different series of daily maximum and minimum temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub>) as well as average relative humidity (RH
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>) data for the 2000–2100 period were used according to the 11-member SCPs.
