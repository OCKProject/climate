<p class="p">In European studies, the THI threshold (THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub>) used to calculate the risk of heat stress varies with the production system, with values ranging from 60 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] to 70 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. For high yielding dairy cows, Zimbelman et al (2009) proposed a THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> of 68 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In the USA, typically the threshold is set at 72 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Most of these studies used T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and RH
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], but in others the average daily THI of an hourly calculated THI [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] or the THI load [
 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] were used. Therefore, models M1-6 were combined with THI
 <sub class="sub">thr</sub> values of 68, 70 and 72 resulting in 18 different investigated models.
