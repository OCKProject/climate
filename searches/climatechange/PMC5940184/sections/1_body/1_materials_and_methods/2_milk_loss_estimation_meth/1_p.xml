<p class="p">The daily milk loss values (kg/cow) were calculated for each grid cell by using six methods (2 sub-daily step, 2 daily step, and 2 mixed) described in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197076.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and in the supplemental material. Daily step methods use only daily values of meteorological parameters (e.g. mean relative humidity) while sub-daily step methods take the diurnal changes of meteorological parameters into account. Sub-daily climatic data were produced from the daily values by postulating an idealised sinusoidal diurnal course of the climatic variables [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197076.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) a mixed formula was used to account for the capacity of dairy cows to avoid heat stress in shorter periods of heat stresses risk representing a more biologically appropriate way of heat stress related milk loss estimation [

 <xref rid="pone.0197076.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. These two models include a sub-daily step milk loss equation for days of heat waves and a daily step milk loss method on other days.
