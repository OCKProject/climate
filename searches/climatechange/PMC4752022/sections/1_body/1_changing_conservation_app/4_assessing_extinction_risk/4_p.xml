 </sup> produced a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of cyclones and droughts on terrestrial mammals, one of the few large-scale studies to consider exposure to extreme events. They followed this exposure analysis with an assessment of terrestrial mammal sensitivity to extreme weather and climate events, identifying biological traits that make large terrestrial mammals more susceptible to climate-induced population declines.
