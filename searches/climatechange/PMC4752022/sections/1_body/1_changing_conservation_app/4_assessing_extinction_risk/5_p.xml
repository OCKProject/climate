<p class="p">Alongside species risk assessments, the assessment of the vulnerability of species to climate change—as well as the climate-related vulnerability of places and natural resources in general—has emerged as an important step in the adaptation process

 </sup>. As with extinction risk assessments, many different approaches to assessing vulnerability have been proposed (for example, 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>), each evaluating some subset or combination of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity

 </sup>. These vulnerability assessments serve not only to determine which species are likely to be most vulnerable but also to identify the factors that make a species vulnerable and thus potential conservation actions—adaptation measures—that can be taken to reduce vulnerability.
