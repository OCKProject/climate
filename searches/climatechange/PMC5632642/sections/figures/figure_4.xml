  <p class="p">Ring‐width indices over time of the four tree species at the study sites Bosco/Gurin (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BOS</styled-content>), Hohgant (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">HOH</styled-content>), and Zermatt (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">ZER</styled-content>) (a–f). The first row shows predictions based on the fixed effects coefficients at five different levels of elevation (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the elevation range covered by the sampled trees at each study site, cf. Table 
   <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The second row shows predictions based on the random effects for each tree included in the model. The third row contains the original detrended ring‐width series that the models are based on. Both the predictions using the random effects and the ring‐width series are colored according to the elevation class of the individual trees
