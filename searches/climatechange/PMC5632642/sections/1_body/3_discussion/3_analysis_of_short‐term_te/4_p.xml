<p class="p">The climatic determinants of larch deviated systematically from those of the other species. Both at Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt, the LMMs for larch included periods of significantly positive effects for previous year's August to October temperatures, with high absolute effects. Although the LMMs for spruce, Swiss stone pine and mountain pine also contained fall months, the period affecting growth occurred later, was shorter, and its absolute effects were smaller. This key difference between larch and the other species may be due to the deciduous nature of larch, relying much on stored carbohydrates to start the new growing season and producing a complete new set of needles (Kagawa, Sugimoto, &amp; Maximov,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). On the contrary, the other species retain their needles for several years. Random effects in relation to the fixed effects of previous late summer/fall temperature were high for all species and sites. Unlike previous correlation analyses, these findings suggest that the need for stored reserves may differ substantially among trees.
