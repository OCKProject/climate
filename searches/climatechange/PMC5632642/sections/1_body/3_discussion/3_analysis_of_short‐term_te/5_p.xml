<p class="p">The amount of snow cover and the timing of snow melt are key factors determining growth processes at upper treeline (Hagedorn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The period of negative effects of spring temperatures on growth of larch at both sites, but also of spruce (although less distinct and with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values higher by several magnitudes) is likely due to a combination of temperature and the amount of snow during late winter/spring. Respiratory carbon losses were found to be directly linked to air temperature, as long as the root zone is too cold to permit the uptake of water (Wieser, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Wieser &amp; Bahn, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Carbon balance analyses at treeline have shown losses during the late winter/spring for evergreen conifers but also for larches, which feature pronounced net carbon losses as late as June (Havranek, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>; Wieser, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This is especially the case because larches have no needles at the beginning of the growing season and therefore cannot counteract the carbon loss, unlike evergreen conifers (Wieser, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The differences between larches at Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt presumably are a consequence of the sites' different precipitation regimes, with Bosco/Gurin having twice the annual precipitation sum and experiencing more extensive late winter snow than Zermatt (Blanchet, Marty, &amp; Lehning, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). On the contrary, snow cover is believed to also have beneficial effects for tree growth under certain conditions. Although low temperatures in late spring shorten the growing season, the subsequent long‐lasting snow cover can provide greater water availability at the start of the growing season (Barbeito et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hättenschwiler &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). This hypothesis allows to explain the longer period of negative effects of spring temperature on tree growth at Hohgant compared to Bosco/Gurin. Trees at Hohgant grow on calcareous bedrock, which is heavily dominated by karst formations and lacks surface runoff. Therefore, they may depend more on water stored as snow than trees at Bosco/Gurin, which are situated on siliceous bedrock. In addition, deeper snow cover causes the trees to be better protected from freezing air temperatures. In a study on dwarf shrubs above treeline, low temperatures causing longer snow cover outweighed the positive effect of higher temperatures in spring that would result in a longer growing season (Wipf, Stoeckli, &amp; Bebi, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Low temperatures favoring snow cover further minimize the exposure of trees to wind abrasion, snow and ice damage, and winter desiccation (Holtmeier, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and promote nutrient availability (Mack, Schuur, Bret‐Harte, Shaver, &amp; Chapin, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Sveinbjornsson, Hofgaard, &amp; Lloyd, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Another important factor controlled by spring temperatures is various forms of snow fungi (
 <italic class="italic">Gremmeniella abietina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> G. laricina</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Phacidium infestans</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Herpotrichia juniperi</italic>). They have been shown to strongly influence growth and mortality particularly of young trees (Barbeito et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), but possibly also to lead to a reduction of the photosynthetically active needle surface of larger trees, which may also lead to reduced growth rates.
