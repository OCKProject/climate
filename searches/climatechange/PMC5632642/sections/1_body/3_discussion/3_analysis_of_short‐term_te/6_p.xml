<p class="p">Carbon allocation to growth versus reserves is a key strategic decision, especially for treeline trees (Felten, Hättenschwiler, Saurer, &amp; Siegwolf, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Landhausser, Pinno, Lieffers, &amp; Chow, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). All tree species experienced conspicuously negative effects in late summer, paired with a high standard deviation of the corresponding random effects (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The cambial activity of trees at treeline finishes around the end of July, however cell‐wall thickening and therefore the completion of the tree‐ring formation can last until mid‐October, even at treeline (e.g., Rossi, Deslauriers, Anfodillo, &amp; Carraro, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Although the share of the total ring width attributed to xylem differentiation is relatively smaller compared to cambial activity, it was found that up to 15% of the total ring width was produced during the cell‐wall thickening phase (Gruber, Zimmermann, Wieser, &amp; Oberhuber, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Larch at Bosco/Gurin stood out with a 3‐month period of negative effects and the highest absolute values across all sites. This phenomenon can be understood by examining the among‐tree variability (random effects). As mentioned above, the positive effects of previous fall temperatures reveal that some trees, most prominently larches, allocate a substantial amount of assimilates to reserves. The trees that deviated positively from the population mean in previous fall showed a negative deviation in the same months of the current year. This potential tradeoff applies to trees that allocate more assimilates to the carbohydrate reserves for the next year rather than to growth for the current year, provided that temperatures are favorable late in the growing season. The absolute values of the fixed effects emphasize again the high importance of reserve storage for the deciduous conifer larch compared to spruce, Swiss stone pine and mountain pine. Still, it has to be noted that the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values of the negative effects of current year's late summer are by several magnitudes higher than those of current and previous year's summer and still larger than those of current year's late winter/spring (Fig.
