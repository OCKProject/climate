<p class="p">In summary, we analyzed climatic treeline sites that do not currently show any strong evidence for an upward movement. The analysis of short‐term temperature–growth relationships using LMMs revealed a considerable amount of previously unquantified among‐tree variability, indicating differing strategies both between and within tree species related to the time when temperature actually affects ring‐width formation. Beyond this, the temperature effects on short‐term tree growth at natural treeline in three distinct regions of the Swiss Alps obtained from LMMs revealed a pattern that is consistent with findings from previous studies, regardless of the climate regime and tree species. In recent decades, positive growth trends across all study sites and species became evident, but they were significant for larch only, which is the most temperature‐sensitive species. The significant positive growth trend was most pronounced at the highest elevations of the study sites, which reflect the effects of ameliorated growth conditions. The observed declining growth trend with decreasing elevation that is most likely due to neighborhood interactions may indicate negative feedback effects of climate change on tree growth at these high‐elevation sites.</p>
