<p class="p">Larch exhibits high climate sensitivity (Carrer &amp; Urbinati, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), exceeding the one of Swiss stone pine, spruce, and mountain pine. This is well reflected in the temperature–growth LMMs (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and may cause the species to profit more strongly from rising temperatures during the growing period (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) than the other species, and thus result in significant positive growth trends. On the contrary, Swiss stone pine, spruce, and mountain pine exhibited rather small effect sizes and therefore lower temperature sensitivity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), leading to non‐significant growth reactions to the long‐term trend of increasing temperatures. However, these species still feature positive growth trends. Unlike the short‐term temperature–growth relationships, the long‐term development of growth over time showed relatively little among‐tree variability (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). This may indicate that, regardless of the period affecting the growth of single trees, the general warming trend in all but 1 month (September) led to a low variability in growth trends over time and elevation. This hypothesis is confirmed by some larch trees, which strongly depend on reserve building that feature a weaker positive trend as mean September temperatures show a less pronounced increase (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) compared to other monthly mean temperatures.
