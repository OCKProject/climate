<p class="p">In contrast to the similar growth trends across all four species at the upper limit of their range, they show a somewhat different trend at lower elevations, that is, further away from treeline. The predictions for larch showed decreasing growth trends, which may be due to the increasing stand density and thus higher competition (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Improved growing conditions lead to higher stand density (Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Mazepa, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), which hampers growth of the early‐successional shade‐intolerant larch (Motta &amp; Nola, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). In this context, the strengthening of the growth trend with decreasing elevation for spruce at Bosco/Gurin and Swiss stone pine at Zermatt can be related to the decrease in larch. Both Swiss stone pine and spruce are evergreen and relatively shade‐tolerant (Anfodillo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>), and they thus may substitute for larch at the lower end of the treeline ecotone. At the upper end of the treeline ecotone, the ability of larch to achieve high productivity throughout the growing season due to osmoregulation (Badalotti, Anfodillo, &amp; Grace, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Carrer &amp; Urbinati, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) is advantageous with regard to its competitors. Although some studies suggest that larch may suffer from drought even at high elevations (Vittoz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), it is unlikely to cause the diminishing positive growth trend with decreasing elevation observed in our study. Despite large differences in precipitation between the two sites (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a,b,d), we found very similar patterns for larch growth at Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), suggesting that drought can be ruled out as a major cause for this interaction. The decline of larch is likely to be the first evidence of long‐suspected feedback effects due to climate change (cf. Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). It must be noted, however, that also the cessation of human activity may result in forest densification (Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) that negatively influences the performance of a shade‐intolerant species such as larch. A definite disentanglement of the causes for the stand densification is not possible with the data at hand. However, based on our rigorous approach to search for study sites, it is unlikely that changes in land use have caused an increase in stand density.
