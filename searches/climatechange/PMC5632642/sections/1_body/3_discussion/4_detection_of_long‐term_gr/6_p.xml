<p class="p">Detecting long‐term tree growth trends by means of dendroecological analyses poses a number of challenges, including biases that may be introduced by the sampling design (Bowman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Nehrbass‐Ahles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and the removal of biological growth trends (Bowman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). When sampling older trees in uneven‐aged stands like those at Bosco/Gurin, Hohgant and Zermatt, the trees' tradeoff between growth rate and longevity (c.f. Bigler &amp; Veblen, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) tends to create a false‐positive growth trend due to the older trees in the sample being probably slow‐growing (“slow‐grower survivorship bias”) and young trees in the sample being mostly fast‐growing, as young slow‐growing trees are likely to be too small to be considered for sampling (“big tree‐selection bias”; Bowman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We tackled these issues by first employing a stratified sampling design to obtain a “pseudo‐population” (Nehrbass‐Ahles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), including selecting trees with DBHs as small as 5 cm, and second starting the trend analysis in the year 1850 only. Although Nehrbass‐Ahles et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found a random sampling design to best address tree growth trends, in our case this would have led to a proportional representation and thus increased number of small and potentially young trees, which would carry limited and very similar information about the recent past. The “pseudo‐population” design was found to be also suited for growth trend analysis (Bowman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Nehrbass‐Ahles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Choosing the year 1850 as starting point arose from (i) the timespan being equal to that of the temperature–growth analyses, where this date was chosen due to the availability of climate data; (ii) ensuring a reasonable sample depth; and (iii) choosing a timeframe well below the known longevity across all tree species included in this study. Thus, these measures should limit the effects of both sampling biases.
