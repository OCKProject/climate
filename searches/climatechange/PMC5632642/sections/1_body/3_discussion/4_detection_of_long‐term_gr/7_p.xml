<p class="p">For detrending the individual tree‐ring series, RCS was used, which is highly sensitive and reliable in detecting long‐term growth trends (Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Although RCS tends to dampen the slope of trends, the probability of false positives and negatives is small (Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In addition, the robustness of LMMs based on growth trend was investigated by ruling out predictive capabilities of supplementary site and tree parameters (cf. Section 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>), that is, the long‐term growth trends contained in the ring‐width series were still best explained by time and elevation only.
