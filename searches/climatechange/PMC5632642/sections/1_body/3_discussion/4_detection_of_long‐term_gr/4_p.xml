<p class="p">Besides the temporal trends in ring widths, predictions based on the fixed effects also suggest overall smaller ring widths of trees growing at higher elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). This decrease validates the use of elevation as a proxy in Equation 
 <xref rid="ece33290-disp-0003" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(3)</xref> for varying temperature conditions experienced by the trees. Although this effect is significant for larch only, it reflects the temperature limitation of growth, which is valid for all trees (e.g., Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) as temperature and length of the growing season decrease when approaching upper treeline. The small amount of among‐tree variability indicates a homogeneous pattern of decreasing ring widths with elevation across the populations at different sites.
