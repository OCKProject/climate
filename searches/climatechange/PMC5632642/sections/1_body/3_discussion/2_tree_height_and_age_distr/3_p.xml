<p class="p">At Hohgant, however, the stands at the highest elevations are rather even‐aged, but still have relatively more trees with recent ingrowth time than in the lower elevation quantiles. This relative abundance of young trees and the lack of older trees at the highest elevation quantiles may be caused either by a rising treeline or due to harsh environmental conditions that promote fast turnover rates caused by frequent dieback (Lloyd &amp; Fastie, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). While the latter would provide evidence for a climatic (i.e., anthropogenically undisturbed) treeline (Harsch &amp; Bader, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), the former cause could indicate a combined effect: treeline rise due to ameliorating growth conditions and the recent cessation of human activities. The age distribution of the dendroecological sample rather points to the latter, yielding a mean tree age exceeding the start of the pronounced temperature increase (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Also, in case of the cessation of, for example, pasturing, one would expect many young trees to establish, but also the presence of a few remaining large old trees, thus leading to a bimodal distribution. This was not evident for any of the highest stands at the three study sites.
