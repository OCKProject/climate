<p class="p">Stand size and age structure analyses can reveal developmental patterns and may therefore provide evidence whether the sampled stands are largely free of anthropogenic disturbance, and can inform about their successional phase (Veblen, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). In our study, stand densities were uniformly low, especially in the highest parts of the stands, and similar to undisturbed treeline sites in the Polar Ural Mountains and interior Alaska (Lloyd &amp; Fastie, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Mazepa, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Both the distribution of tree heights and ingrowth times in the uppermost 25% of the elevation gradient at Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt feature uneven age distributions and reverse J‐shaped height distributions (McCarthy &amp; Weetman, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Shorohova, Kuuluvainen, Kangur, &amp; Jogiste, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Thus, we conclude that these stands are forest outposts that have established prior to the beginning of the current warming trend, and do not appear to be moving uphill yet (cf. Harsch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). At Zermatt, this is additionally backed by the mean ages of the trees included in the sample, indicating the trees to have grown at the highest elevations also before the beginning of the pronounced temperature increase (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, the dendroecological sample of Bosco/Gurin yields trees at the highest elevations that are younger on average, which may indicate more recent ingrowth and a beginning advance of this treeline.
