<p class="p">Average stand density across the entire elevational gradient was 277 trees/ha at Bosco/Gurin, 128 trees/ha at Hohgant, and 153 trees/ha at Zermatt; for the highest 25%, densities were 129, 89, and 48 trees/ha, respectively. At all study sites, the absolute number of trees in the highest 25% of the gradients was lower than within the lowest 25% or the central portion (25%–75%) of the elevation gradients (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, tree height distributions varied across study sites and elevation gradients. With increasing elevation, the distributions prominently shifted toward lower tree heights (Figure
