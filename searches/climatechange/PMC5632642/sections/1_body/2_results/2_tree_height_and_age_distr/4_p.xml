<p class="p">The age distribution of the remotely sensed trees in the highest 25% of the elevation gradients approximated a negative J‐shaped curve of ingrowth time at Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt, while at Hohgant it was closer to a right‐skewed unimodal shape (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). The lower parts of the stands at Hohgant also showed unimodal, bell‐shaped ingrowth time distributions. The distributions of the lower quantiles at Bosco/Gurin featured multiple modes and were right‐skewed, while at Zermatt they were close to negative J‐shaped curves.
