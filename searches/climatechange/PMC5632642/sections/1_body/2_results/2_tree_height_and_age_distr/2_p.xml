<p class="p">The age distribution of the dendroecological samples across the elevation gradients indicates Bosco/Gurin to have the youngest trees overall, whereas Hohgant and Zermatt have trees of similar age (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Bosco/Gurin yields a tree age of 36 ± 15 years (mean ± standard deviation) at the highest 25% and an increase to 72 ± 55 years when going down to the lower end of the sample. At Hohgant and Zermatt, the trees across the gradient are older, with tree ages at the upper 25% of 104 ± 55 years and 94 ± 28 years, respectively. At Hohgant, the mean ages are similar across the entire gradient, and at Zermatt there is a decrease in mean age in the middle 50% and again an increase in the lower 25% of the gradient.
