<p class="p">To assess whether growth trends were associated with trends in climate variables, monthly mean temperature anomalies relative to the 1971–2000 reference period were calculated for 1850–2008, showing increasing temperatures at all sites and in all months (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Patterns and strength of the temperature trends varied considerably among individual months, but only little between sites. All months except September exhibited a clear increase in temperature, starting around 1950 at the latest. The strongest temperature increase for all sites was found for June, featuring relatively constant temperatures around the 1971–2000 June mean until shortly after 1950, followed by a pronounced rise of almost 2°C. The weakest warming was evident for September, with mean temperatures staying relatively constant over the entire time period. The absolute increase in September mean temperature amounted to approximately 0.5°C since 1850.
