<p class="p">For mountain pine at Hohgant, the low fixed effects of time and elevation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>) caused a rather weak positive trend of ring‐width indices and decreasing base level of ring‐width indices with increasing elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f). There was a constant positive growth trend across elevations. However, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values indicated that the trend was not significant.
