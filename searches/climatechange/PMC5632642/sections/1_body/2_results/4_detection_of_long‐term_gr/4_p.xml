<p class="p">For Swiss stone pine at Zermatt, the LMM yielded overall increasing ring‐width indices over time and a decreasing intercept of ring‐width indices with elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e). The interaction term caused a strengthening of the positive growth trend with decreasing elevation. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values for the fixed effects were nearly significant (Table
