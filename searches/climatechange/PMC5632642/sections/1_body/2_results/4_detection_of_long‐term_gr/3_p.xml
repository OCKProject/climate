<p class="p">For spruce at Bosco/Gurin, the LMM revealed weaker effects of time and elevation, featuring a stable positive growth trend on all elevation levels and decreasing absolute ring‐width indices with elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c), but the standard deviation of the random effect for the intercept was high relative to the fixed effect intercept (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Conversely, the LMM for spruce at Hohgant showed weaker effects of time and elevation but a stronger interaction, resulting in a strengthening of the positive trend with decreasing elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d). Both spruce LMMs did not indicate any highly significant effects.
