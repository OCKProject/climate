<p class="p">For Swiss stone pine and mountain pine, there were no clear seasonal patterns (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). While for mountain pine, current year's July temperature effect was notably higher (0.21) than the other fixed effects, the Swiss stone pine model featured generally low absolute values of coefficients with the highest positive coefficient in current year's May.
