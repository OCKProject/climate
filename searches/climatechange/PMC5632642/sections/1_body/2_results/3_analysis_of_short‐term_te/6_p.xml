<p class="p">With the inclusion of random intercepts and slopes in the LMMs, among‐tree variability may be quantified in relation to the fixed effects. The standard deviations of the random effects showed considerable variability due to individual tree characteristics and tree‐specific environmental conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Similar to the fixed effects, larch exhibited the highest among‐tree variability. However, for current year's July (highest positive fixed effect), the standard deviation of the random effect was notably low, that is, tree growth responded in a similar way to temperature. This is also true for spruce and mountain pine, showing standard deviations of a comparable magnitude as the fixed effects in most months, except for July. Swiss stone pine, with its differing behavior featuring May as the month with the highest positive fixed effect, also has the relatively lowest standard deviation of the random effect in May.
