<p class="p">The number of temperature variables affecting growth variability that were included in the LMMs showed considerable variability between species and sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), ranging from six monthly variables for spruce at Hohgant to eleven variables for larch at Bosco/Gurin. Also, the absolute values of the coefficients varied considerably, with larch having fixed effect values mostly &gt;0.1, whereas spruce, mountain pine, and Swiss stone pine had values mostly &lt;0.1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Still, only two fixed effects were not significant (previous August for larch and current April for Swiss stone pine at Zermatt); all other coefficients featured 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values &lt;0.01 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Since our approach included multiple tests, the standard errors and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values were biased to some extent. Still, in most cases, the absolute 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values lie at least one magnitude below the most rigorous significance level of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). As the temperature variables were centered and scaled in the LMMs, a fixed effect of 0.1 indicates a 10% increase in ring‐width indices with a temperature increase by one standard deviation.
