<p class="p">Larch showed a pattern of four clearly distinguishable seasonal periods at both Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt: positive fixed effects for previous year's late summer and fall temperatures (previous August, September, and October at both sites), negative fixed effects for current year's late winter and spring (February, March, and April at Bosco/Gurin, February and April at Zermatt), positive fixed effects for current year's mid‐summer (June and July at both Bosco/Gurin and Zermatt), and negative fixed effects for current year's late summer and fall (August, September, and October at Bosco/Gurin and August only at Zermatt). The highest positive values for both Bosco/Gurin (0.22) and Zermatt (0.25) resulted for current year's July, and the lowest negative values (−0.19 and −0.12, respectively) were found for current year's April (Figure
