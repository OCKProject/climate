<p class="p">Similar to larch, spruce featured significant seasonal periods for current year's late winter and spring, mid‐ and late‐summer as well as fall at both Bosco/Gurin and Hohgant (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, there were no clear seasonal effects for previous year's fall. The majority of absolute effect values for spruce at both sites was considerably lower, mostly below 0.1. As for larch, the highest positive fixed effects were found for July with 0.12 at Bosco/Gurin and 0.21 at Hohgant (Figure
