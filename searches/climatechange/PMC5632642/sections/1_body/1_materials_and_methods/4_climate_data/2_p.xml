<p class="p">For the analysis of climate–tree growth relationships, gridded HISTALP monthly mean surface temperature (spatial resolution 5 arc minutes) was used (Chimani, Matulla, Böhm, &amp; Hofstätter, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). To ensure correct representation of treeline temperature conditions in the HISTALP data, a total of 72 (eight per plot) temperature loggers (iButton DS1922L, Maxim Integrated) were installed, which recorded hourly 2 m air temperature between May 2014 and November 2015. The temperature loggers were protected from radiation by self‐developed Gill screens. A direct evaluation of HISTALP temperatures against in‐situ measurements was not possible, since the gridded data were only available until 2008. Therefore, we calculated Pearson correlations (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between treeline stand monthly mean temperatures and all available monthly mean temperature records of MeteoSwiss climate stations. Stations with the highest correlations and longest time series were selected (station Locarno/Monti for Bosco/Gurin, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .98; station Grimsel Hospiz for Hohgant, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .98; station Col du Grand St. Bernard for Zermatt, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .99) and used to analogously evaluate the HISTALP data (grid cell Bosco/Gurin, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .97; grid cell Hohgant, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .95; grid cell Zermatt, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .98). HISTALP monthly mean temperatures were used from 1850 onwards. We did not use precipitation data for the analysis as (i) temperature is assumed to be the major limiting factor at the study sites (Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and (ii) long‐term precipitation data are only available from climate stations far from the study sites, which cannot be used due the highly inhomogeneous distribution of precipitation in mountainous terrain (Daly, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and (iii) the available water capacity of a tree is not only defined by precipitation, but would need to be assessed in combination with soil characteristics and slope (Barij, Stokes, Bogaard, &amp; Van Beek, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
