<p class="p">The following treeline sites in the Swiss Alps were selected, each containing multiple forest outposts: (i) Stavel Crastu near Bosco/Gurin (treeline at approximately 2,200 m a.s.l., for a photo see Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), (ii) the Hohgant massif near Schangnau (treeline elevation at approximately 2,000 m a.s.l., Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), and (iii) the Gugle ridge near Zermatt (treeline elevation at approximately 2,500 m a.s.l., Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Each study area is located in a distinct climate region of the Swiss Alps: Bosco/Gurin is situated in the Insubrian southern Alps with high precipitation and high irradiation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), Hohgant in the northern Alps experiencing high precipitation and low irradiation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c), and Zermatt in the central Alps with low precipitation and high irradiation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33290-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d). These distinct differences in precipitation and radiation patterns enable us to qualitatively assess the impact of precipitation on the short‐ and long‐term growth variability, rather than using interpolated precipitation data, which would potentially introduce a high amount of uncertainty (Daly,
