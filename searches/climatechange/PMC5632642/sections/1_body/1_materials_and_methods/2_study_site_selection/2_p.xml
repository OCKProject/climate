<p class="p">The shape of treelines can help to identify sites that are undisturbed by human activities, as it is reasonable to assume that diffuse treelines are limited by temperature during the growing season while abrupt treelines are forced by climatic controls on seedling mortality or frost‐ and wind‐induced growth limitations (Harsch &amp; Bader,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Additionally, the recent cessation or extensification of human activities in many regions of the Swiss Alps renders it challenging to differentiate between changes in the functioning and dynamics of treeline ecosystems that are caused by recovery from human land use and those that arise from climate change (Gehrig‐Fasel et al.,
