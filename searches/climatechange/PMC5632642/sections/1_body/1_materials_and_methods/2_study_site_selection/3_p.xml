<p class="p">The study sites were chosen using multiple criteria. The regionally highest patches of forest in Switzerland were identified using Swiss land use statistics GEOSTAT (Gehrig‐Fasel et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), these regionally highest patches of forest are most likely limited by temperature and not by anthropogenic activities. The climatic limitation of these sites was checked by examining changes in treeline position between historic and current aerial images and evaluating detailed descriptions of high‐elevation treelines from the early 20th century (Brockmann‐Jerosch,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1900</xref>). During preliminary field surveys, the form of these treelines was assessed according to the conceptual model by Harsch and Bader (

Still, we cannot exclude that some of the ongoing ingrowth and densification of the forests at the identified treeline sites is due to anthropogenic influences or abiotic treeline modulators other than temperature.
