<p class="p">Trends in tree growth are often affected by biases introduced by the sampling design (Bowman et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A review of past studies on tree growth trends (Bontemps &amp; Esper, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Melvin &amp; Briffa,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) led us to favor regional curve standardization (RCS; Becker, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>; Briffa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>) to account for the trees' age trend. For RCS, the cambial age of the tree at coring height is needed. For cores that did not hit the pith, a geometric method was used to estimate the number of missing years to the pith based on ring curvature and the average of the first five measurable ring widths (Duncan, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Cores with more than 10 missing rings were excluded to restrict uncertainty introduced by this estimation.
