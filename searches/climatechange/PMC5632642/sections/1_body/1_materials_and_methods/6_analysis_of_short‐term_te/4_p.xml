<p class="p">After identifying the best‚Äêfitting model for each species and site, the LMM with the random intercept was extended by adding random effects for those variables, which were selected as fixed effects. This model form was then refitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. The assumptions of the final models were investigated to ensure the validity of the interpretation of model outputs. Model diagnostics included checks for linearity, absence of collinearity and heteroscedasticity, and normality of residuals. All calculations were conducted in the R statistics software (R Core Team,
