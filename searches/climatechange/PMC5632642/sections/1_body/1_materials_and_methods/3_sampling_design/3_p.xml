<p class="p">The sampled tree species included Norway spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>) and European larch (
 <italic class="italic">Larix decidua</italic>) at Bosco/Gurin, Norway spruce and mountain pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus mugo</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">uncinata</italic>) at Hohgant, and Swiss stone pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus cembra</italic>) and European larch at Zermatt. Trees in each DBH class covered the complete elevation range of the plot. Two cores were taken per tree, one at breast height (130 cm) and one as close as possible to the root collar–shoot boundary. During coring, we always attempted to hit the pith. The estimation of tree age and primary growth rate from the stem base to breast height is essential and only possible when the pith is included in the sample. Each tree's coordinates, tree height, crown length, DBH, elevation, aspect, and slope were measured. We further recorded whether the tree grew with a single or multiple stems. In the laboratory, the increment cores were mounted on wooden supports, sanded and the ring widths measured with a resolution of 0.01 mm on a measurement device (Lintab 5, Rinntech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to standard dendrochronological procedures (Fritts, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1976</xref>). The ring‐width series were crossdated visually and quantitatively using COFECHA (Holmes, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>) to ensure correct assignment of calendar years to each ring (cf. Table 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for summary statistics of the tree‐ring‐width series).
