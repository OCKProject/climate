<p class="p">To assess tree age distributions of the remote sensing sample, tree heights were converted to tree age employing site‐specific linear regressions of tree age and tree height. These linear models were calculated using the dendroecological sample, which included measured tree ages and tree heights (for the age–height relationships see Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33290-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Tree ages were estimated by dating the pith of the cores taken at the base of the trees. Tree ages were then converted to ingrowth times and plotted analogously to the height distributions in three elevation classes. The elevational extent and the size of the stands that were analyzed with remote sensing data were larger than and slightly different to the dendroecological sampling and ranged between 1,658 and 2,140 m a.s.l. and approx. 70 ha at Bosco/Gurin, 1,698–1,975 m a.s.l. and approx. 90 ha at Hohgant, and 2,129–2,492 m a.s.l. and 140 ha at Zermatt (Table
