<p class="p">To capture stand structure, the height distribution of trees in each stand was surveyed by means of 3D surface model reconstructions. We used largely overlapping high‐resolution (&lt;10 cm/px) aerial imagery obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Canopy height models were derived and single trees with a height &gt;2.5 m automatically delineated (Hyyppa, Kelle, Lehikoinen, &amp; Inkinen,

 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For each stand, the trees were grouped in three elevation classes, using the 25th and 75th percentile as class breaks. Then, tree height distributions were plotted for each elevation class.
