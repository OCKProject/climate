<p class="p">A prominent consequence of global warming is changing growth rates of trees, which are determined by short‐ to long‐term climate effects on tree growth. Relationships between climate variables and secondary growth rates on the level of tree populations have been studied for a long time (e.g., Fritts, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1976</xref>). The effects of monthly or seasonal climate variables on population mean growth at the elevational or latitudinal treeline are well tested (Graumlich, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Kipfmueller &amp; Salzer, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), also for the European Alps (Babst et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Carrer, Anfodillo, Urbinati, &amp; Carraro, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Frank &amp; Esper, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Oberhuber et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, some recent studies suggest considerable amounts of variability of the individual trees' growth response, which are not identifiable with standard analyses based on growth data at the population level (c.f. Buras et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Carrer, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Graumlich, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Vanoni, Bugmann, Nötzli, &amp; Bigler, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). To date, this among‐tree variability has rarely been accounted for, and the magnitude of its effect on the explanatory power of climate–growth analyses is suspected to be large but remains unclear. Additionally, the timing of growth appears to be temporally fine‐scaled (Kirdyanov, Hughes, Vaganov, Schweingruber, &amp; Silkin, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Lenz, Hoch, &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and thus temporally higher resolved climatic data than only seasonal means should be used.
