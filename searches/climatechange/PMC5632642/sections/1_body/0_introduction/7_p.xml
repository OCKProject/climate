<p class="p">In the European Alps, a large share of the treeline rise can be attributed to the cessation of human activities (e.g., Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Leonelli, Pelfini, &amp; Di Cella, 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). When assessing the impact of climate change on treeline forest dynamics, biases due to the confounding influence of this decrease in land use as well as other regional treeline modulators, such as geomorphological processes, wind and snow damages need to be considered. While the cessation of human land use and geomorphological processes mainly affect studies on the establishment of trees above the current tree limits (Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Leonelli et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33290-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), other factors such as wind and snow can also influence short‐ and long‐term tree growth variability. When we try to isolate the impacts of increasing temperatures on tree growth variability, it is therefore necessary to rule out growth‐determining factors other than temperature as much as possible.
