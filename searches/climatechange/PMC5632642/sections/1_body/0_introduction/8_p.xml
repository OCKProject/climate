<p class="p">We carefully selected climatic treeline sites in three major climate regions of the Swiss Alps that are as undisturbed by non‐climatic drivers (e.g., land use, geomorphology, etc.) as possible, which makes them suitable for the analysis of the effects of recent climate change. The goals of our study were to evaluate the elevational dynamics of these treeline stands using stand structure and age data, analyze short‐term temperature–growth relationships of major treeline tree species at the population and individual tree level and quantify longer‐term growth trends at the population and tree level. Specifically, we ask the following research questions: (i) Are the analyzed treeline sites limited by temperature and do they show signs of suspected upward movement? (ii) Which monthly temperature variables control the annual growth of trees at the treeline and how do their effects differ among climate regimes, species, and individual trees? (iii) Do long‐term growth rates reflect the recently increasing temperatures due to climate change, and can we identify feedback effects on growth rates?</p>
