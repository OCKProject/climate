<p id="Par11" class="p">Climate change is a formidable challenge. It entails a combination of slow-onset and rapid-onset events with uncertain and uneven impacts (Field et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>) and is expected to become more frequent and forceful, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (Lobell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">2008</xref>; World Bank 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" class="xref">2012</xref>; Field et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>). It is accelerating to the extent that the risk of failing to stabilise the climate at the 2-degrees-target is real, making both adaptation and mitigation more urgent (Stocker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">2013</xref>; Geden and Beck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2014</xref>; Stocker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">2014</xref>). There is a risk, though, of reaching limits to adaptation especially in places that are most exposed to climate change impacts such as sub-Saharan agriculture where profound social change, rather than merely adjustment, should be a main purpose of adaptation (Noble et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, this is not without problems, neither in terms of who gets to decide the direction or the depth of that transformation nor its distributional outcome. Once the difficulties of transformational adaptation are recognised it is necessary to discuss how to grasp potential opportunities while remembering that adaptation is ‘underpinned by diverse values’ varying across contexts and cultures (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013a</xref>).
