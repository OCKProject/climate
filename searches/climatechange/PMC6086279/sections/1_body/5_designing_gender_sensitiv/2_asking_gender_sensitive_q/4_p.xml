<p id="Par49" class="p">One way to explore adaptation is to be informed not only by theories on gender and social power (De Haan and Zoomers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2005</xref>) or transformative power (Avelino and Rotmans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2009</xref>), but also by discursive institutionalism offering tools to identify early signs of social change as expressed in the (not so easily observable) thinking and speaking that precedes women’s and men’s more observable acting (Schmidt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">2008</xref>). Tracing, scrutinising, and challenging discursive constructions is thus an important aspect of feminist research, also on climate change (MacGregor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">2010</xref>). Based on that, and as guidance in research, I pose nine descriptive, interpretive, explanatory, and potentially prescriptive questions:
