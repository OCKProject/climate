<p id="Par47" class="p">In concrete terms, it has recently been argued that climate change adaptation should include a gender-sensitive analysis while climate actions require gender sensitivity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). Here a comparative analysis across sites and scales may bring comprehensive and more meaningful understandings that can inform policies and programmesâ€”if and how climate change will impact the lives of women and men differently (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2014</xref>; Alston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). To avoid preserving or reinforcing gender inequalities, it is essential that both politics and research on the grounded realities of climate events and climate change adaptation should be informed by social justice and gender-sensitive approaches (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2014</xref>). Hence, feminists argue that theory and practice in climate change adaptation and disaster management should communicate more with each other on common issues such as gender justice and the reduction of environmental risks (Enarson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2013</xref>) while also observing the agenda on global justice in the development debate (Cornwall and Rivas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2015</xref>).
