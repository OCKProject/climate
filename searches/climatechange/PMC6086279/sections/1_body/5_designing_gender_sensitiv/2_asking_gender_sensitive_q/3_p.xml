<p id="Par48" class="p">Findings from in-depth studies on the dynamics of gender regimes for land, labour, natural resources, and power (Steen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">2011</xref>) can be used to frame further research. As regards the social construction of gender and its manifestations in a particular setting or situation, it is helpful to distinguish systematically between three dimensions—the abstract, the concrete social or collective, and the concrete individual (Franz-Balsen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>). Comparing concrete and specific situations with abstract and general thinking means comparing what is in flux with what is fixed, thus comparing the dynamic process of reality (flux)—such as potentially changing gender norms under socio-ecological stress—with static concepts (fixed)—such as those found in theory (Gunnarsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2011</xref>, p 34). In case of tension between the two, new ideas and concepts can be discovered, formulated, and proposed—and action taken.
