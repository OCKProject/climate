<p id="Par43" class="p">Scholars who offer constructive advice on increased efficiency and gender equality in agricultural intervention and extension services, in climate change adaptation, and in policy related to both, have suggested a transformative gender approach (Manfre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2013</xref>; Farnworth and Colverson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2015</xref>). It would not only seek to make gradual improvements to meet women’s (immediate) needs, but also engage with men more profoundly to enable a change in gender relations and the gendered coding of responsibilities in the long term. To achieve that, we would have to use methods that better fit the given agricultural context, reach women and men at times and places that are convenient to their productive and reproductive responsibilities, and acknowledge gender variation in priorities, labour productivity, and time use (Manfre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2013</xref>). For policy, researchers suggest that we could address gender relations by following an ‘empowerment pathway’ (Farnworth and Colverson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2015</xref>) that actively involves not only women but also men while at the same time rethinking the coding of male and female work tasks (Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2012</xref>; Farnworth and Colverson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2015</xref>). A similar approach is suggested by scholars who have launched a new and detailed research agenda on this issue for agricultural interventions (Farnworth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2016</xref>).
