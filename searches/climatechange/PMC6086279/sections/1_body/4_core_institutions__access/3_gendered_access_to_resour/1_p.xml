<p id="Par40" class="p">According to some observers, limited access and restricted rights to resources make women particularly vulnerable to climate change (UNDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">2007</xref>), especially if crop failure, fuel shortage, and water scarcity affect their capacity to discharge what is deemed to be their food provision responsibility (Kes and Swaminathan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2006</xref>). Women and men depend differently on energy, land, water, and other natural and social resources for their everyday life and long-term existence (Doss

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">2009</xref>; Otzelberger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2011</xref>) and it is often stated that women, more than men, face ‘a litany of structural, technological, and cultural barriers’ (Denton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2002</xref>, p 17). To fulfil gendered productive and reproductive responsibilities and obligations women may have an interest in, depend on, and manage natural resources while neither having the right to nor being entitled to control these same resources. In many fishing and farming communities, women initiate, participate in and contribute to production while having less (secure) access to natural resources such as land or social resources such as capital, education, and information (Manfre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2013</xref>). At the same time, women have multiple reproductive responsibilities and ‘every dawn brings with it a long march in search of fuel, fodder and water’ (Dankelman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2002</xref>, p 23).
