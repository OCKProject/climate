<p id="Par44" class="p">The many inequalities in climate change can be theorised in different ways. If sustainability science puts a feminist political ecology lens on climate change and natural resources management, it may better understand the gendering of impacts, responses, and decision-making power (Andersson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>). Yet, that necessitates a contextual and intersectional understanding of climate change impacts (Kaijser and Kronsell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2014</xref>) and presupposes a comprehensive view of gendered subjectivities and identities (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2014</xref>).
