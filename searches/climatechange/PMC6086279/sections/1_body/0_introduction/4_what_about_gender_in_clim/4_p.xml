<p id="Par9" class="p">Despite the fact that adaptation is gendered and varies across scales and subjectivities (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2014</xref>), knowledge on how climate change interacts with geographical and social inequality is underrepresented in policy and research (Dankelman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2010</xref>; Hammond 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2012</xref>; Olsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2014</xref>). In a bibliometric analysis using the ISI Web of Science to search abstracts, keywords, and titles for the terms ‘climate’ AND ‘adaptation’ AND ‘gender’ in research published January 2000–April 2017, I found 188 social science articles containing the three concepts. Few of these (only 17) were published before 2011. After that, the number of articles and the citations they receive have grown exponentially. In comparison, and using the same approach, I found 7004 social science articles on ‘climate’ AND ‘adaptation’ published January 2000–April 2017. This search in the ISI database is only a rough indication. It does not exclude that there are other research articles relevant for climate change adaptation and gender. To exemplify, the cross-chapter box on gender and climate in IPCC AR5 refers to 34 articles, of which only every other title overlaps with my search (Vincent et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" class="xref">2014</xref>). Now that the agenda on women–environment dynamics is gaining strength from the climate change debate more gender relevant research is on its way (Resurrección 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">2013</xref>). And although empowerment of women in relation to climate change policy varies between countries, there are signs that the mainstreaming of gender and women’s needs in climate change responses is increasing in policy documents in East and Southern Africa (Nhamo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">2014</xref>, p 156). Nonetheless, it is evident that gender is under-researched within climate change adaptation. Explorative and systematic studies on power and ethics (Moosa and Tuana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2014</xref>), distribution and environmental justice (Jerneck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2015</xref>), and impacts and responses (Pearse 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">2017</xref>) would thus contribute further valuable knowledge.
