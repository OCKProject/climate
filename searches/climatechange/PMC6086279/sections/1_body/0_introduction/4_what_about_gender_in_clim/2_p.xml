<p id="Par7" class="p">Given that climate change adaptation entails structural and intersectional power, critical geographers argue that research and policy must disentangle social processes and practices and be sensitive to intersecting inequalities that emerge when climate change impacts and responses cut across age, class, ethnicity, gender, and space (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2014</xref>). For that purpose, gender-informed approaches, and disaggregated data are essential (Alston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>). Counting, measuring, and mapping may provide correlations and quantitative overviews for comparison, whereas in-depth research on social structures and individual practices in everyday life is needed for understanding causality (Jönsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2012</xref>). Since available evidence is ‘limited, patchy, varied and highly contextual’ it is not yet widely confirmed that/how climate change has differential impact on women and men in terms of assets, agency, and achievements, but data are fairly consistent with the two propositions that ‘climate impacts may affect men and women differently’ and ‘women tend to suffer more negatively in terms of their assets and well-being’ (Goh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>). This vulnerability, as documented by several studies, is not intrinsic to women but due to the gendered distribution and organisation of land and labour (Pearse
