<p id="Par2" class="p">There is an increasing number of studies on climate change adaptation, but it is still disproportionate to the importance of the issue. Few studies have tested how adaptation is perceived and understood at the nexus of climate change and poverty (Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">2014</xref>). Even fewer studies have explored how exposed settings in rainfed small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experience climate change and poverty in relation to gender as a core analytical category. Research in sustainability science (SS) has identified key conditions that are crucial for understanding the scope for climate change adaptation and poverty alleviation in this region (Gabrielsson et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2014</xref>). The food and health condition imply that small-scale farmers strive to secure food and fend off threats to their health (Gabrielsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013</xref>; Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gabrielsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2014</xref>). The gender condition refers to how gender as a higher order process and a fundamental social relation in society is manifested in the gender regimes of land, labour, and marital love (Steen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">2011</xref>). The regimes institutionalise how resources are accessed, distributed, and consumed, how labour is coded, re-coded, and divided into productive and reproductive tasks, and how social practices and responsibilities are discursively defined and fulfilled. Together these conditions affect how farmers perceive risk, prioritise and share tasks in everyday farming, experience hardship and shape aspirations about future livelihoods. All this will influence the adaptation space. To be successful, climate change adaptation and technology adoption informed by SS must therefore take these conditions into account (Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2014</xref>).
