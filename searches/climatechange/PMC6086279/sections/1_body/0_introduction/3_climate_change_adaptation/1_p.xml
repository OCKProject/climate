<p id="Par4" class="p">IPCC defines climate change adaptation as ‘adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities’ (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2007</xref>). As also confirmed by IPCC (Noble et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">2014</xref>) and others (Leighton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2011</xref>), mainstream literature often strips climate change adaptation of its human content and social context while instead linking it to technology, such as climate-proofing of infrastructure, or economic tools, such as insurance policies, with dire consequences for poverty alleviation. Meanwhile, adaptation seen as a process of profound

 <italic class="italic">transformation</italic>, gets less attention (Khan and Roberts 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2013</xref>). That void will be addressed here from the perspective of farming communities in sub-Saharan Africa representing one of the most climate change vulnerable areas in the world (World Bank
