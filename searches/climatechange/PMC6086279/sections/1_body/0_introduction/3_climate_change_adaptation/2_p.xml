<p id="Par5" class="p">Adaptation and mitigation are socially, spatially, and temporally differentiated responses to climate change. Whereas mitigation refers to reduction of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to potential adverse impacts of climate change, adaptation means adjusting to actual or expected climate effects. Adaptation can be incremental serving to maintain a system/process, or transformative serving to fundamentally change system attributes. It can be protective in terms of taking preventive measures against negative impacts or opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of potential beneficial effects of climate change (IPCC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">b</xref>). Although poor communities in the global South would prioritise adaptation over mitigation, some of the most effective adaptation measures are also important mitigation strategies (Tschakert and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">2005</xref>; Olsson and Jerneck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2010</xref>) as exemplified by the technology adoption of: agro-forestry (Sanchez

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2007</xref>) and improved cooking-stoves consuming less fuelwood while releasing fewer pollutants and lower emissions (Olsson and Jerneck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2010</xref>; Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2012</xref>). Still, populations who are poor and highly exposed to climatic events may be severely constrained in promoting their own (economic or political) agenda (UNDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" class="xref">2009</xref>). To advance their cause in international climate change negotiation and policies, it is pertinent to demonstrate that this population is big, their potential contribution to mitigation is decisive, and strategies that cement or reinforce existing inequalities should be avoided (Olsson and Jerneck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2010</xref>).
