<p id="Par3" class="p">The article is outlined along three pertinent questions on climate change adaptation in the global South: what is its purpose, how can similar processes, such as development, inform it, and what institutions in terms of rights and responsibilities are core to it? To address the first question, on the purpose of adaptation, I discuss three key aspects: inequality in the causes, impacts, and responses to climate change (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>); variation in the definitions, framings, and understandings of climate change adaptation; and adaptation in the midst of multiple stressors and vulnerability in small-scale agriculture (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). To justify a discussion on adaptation in the light of development and sustainability, I refer to the often repeated argument that they must be tackled in combination (Klein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2005</xref>) partly because of obvious overlaps and synergies but mainly because ‘climate change risks are redefining what development policies can accomplish’ (Agrawal and Lemos 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2015</xref>). To address the second question, on how adaptation in the global South relates to development, I discuss gender dynamics of poverty, inequality, and distribution in small-scale agriculture (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref>). To address the third question, on core institutions in adaptation, I propose a frame with questions for how one could proceed in gender-informed research on climate change adaptation (Sects. 
 <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec" class="xref">6</xref>). Inspiration comes from three main sources. First, an editorial by Jon Barnett posing similar questions for policy-relevant research on climate change adaptation: what is its purpose, are there analogies, and which institutions matter (Barnett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2010</xref>)? Second, sustainability science research on food, gender, and health conditions in sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture, here referred to as the ‘three imperatives’ (Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2014</xref>), and third, literature on power asymmetries in the distribution, procedure, and recognition of climate justice in adaptation and development (Popke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">2016</xref>; Whyte 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">2014</xref>). Speaking of climate change adaptation in 
 <italic class="italic">interdisciplinary</italic> terms helps capturing the complexity of natural and social dimensions of human–environment interaction (Jerneck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2011</xref>; Moosa and Tuana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2014</xref>). In addition, it furthers the use of sustainability science as an umbrella field for integrated knowledge (Shahadu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">2016</xref>) based on pluralism in theory and methods (Isgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2017</xref>). Below, I define core concepts and explain the rationale for gender-informed research.
