<p id="Par15" class="p">Adaptation is widely recognised as one of two main response options to reduce the risks from climate change. It involves established major practices such as agricultural outreach, coastal management, disaster risk management, resource management, spatial and urban planning, and public health (Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2007</xref>, p 268). It refers to the ability of individuals, societies, and systems to cope with multi-scalar processes (Dodman and Mitlin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>) and to use information on present and future climate change in relation to the suitability of current and planned policies, practices and infrastructure (Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2007</xref>, p 268). It has to be informed not only by geographical insights on bio-physical, geo-morphological, and hydrological conditions, but also by socio-technological conditions and relations. As risks cannot be fully eliminated, adaptation needs to reduce exposure and vulnerability while also increasing capacity to resist or recover from the potential adverse impacts of climate extremes (Field et al.
