<p id="Par19" class="p">Although major social processes interact and overlap, many development agencies and practitioners distinguish (too much) between climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and poverty alleviation (Reid and Schipper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the global South, underlying ideological and theoretical assumptions about development may influence interpretations of adaptation and vulnerability (Ireland and McKinnon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>). Using adaptation to reconstitute conventional growth-driven development is not necessarily acceptable, efficient or fair, particularly not from post-development perspectives seeking to shift the focus towards climate change drivers and the aspirations of local communities (Ireland and McKinnon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>). Using a general recipe for adaptation is not necessarily the most productive way to address climate change and donors must ‘refuse to know exactly what should be done or how’ (Ireland and McKinnon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>). Instead, adaptation could be an opportunity to go beyond conventional development and seek to implement the unfulfilled promises to reduce poverty and inequality while enhancing sustainability (Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2008</xref>).
