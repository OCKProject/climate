<p id="Par18" class="p">Adaptation is closely associated with climate change vulnerability and how we speak of their interdependence will influence how we act (Bassett and Fogelman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>). IPCC sees climate impacts as a main source of vulnerability which calls for adaptation as adjustment; others locate risks in both nature and society as a source of vulnerability thus seeing adaptation as social reform or development and a means to reduce vulnerability within prevailing systems; but little research explores the (deeper) social drivers of vulnerability or the need to understand and achieve adaptation as a political-economic transformation (Bassett and Fogelman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>) and as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ribot 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" class="xref">2011</xref>).
