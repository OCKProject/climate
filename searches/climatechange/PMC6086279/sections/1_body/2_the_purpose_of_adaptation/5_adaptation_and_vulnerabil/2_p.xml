<p id="Par21" class="p">Climate change impacts and responses interact with existing and emerging gendered capacities and vulnerabilities in complex ways, often resulting in unintended consequences (UNDP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">2010</xref>, p 39). To take an example, the loss of assets, crops, gardens, home-based production, and livestock in consequence of water-related hazards such as cyclones, droughts, erosion, floods, and land-slides may all have gendered implications. Women and men may be affected differently, depending on how social relations shape rights and responsibilities in production, reproduction, and decision-making (Alston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). And if women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts they may also be disadvantaged in access to adaptation resources (Demetriades and Esplen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2008</xref>; Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>). Research on the effects on equity, efficiency, and identity will thus necessitate further studies on the gender dynamics of climate change (Oâ€™Neill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2010</xref>).
