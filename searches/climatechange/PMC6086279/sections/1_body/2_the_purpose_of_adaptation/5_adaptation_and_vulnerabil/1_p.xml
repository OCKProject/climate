<p id="Par20" class="p">There is no single best definition of vulnerability because context and purpose are important for assessing it (Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2007</xref>). Often it is seen as intertwined with poverty, but plays out differently depending on the social and political ecology of the context. In the gender literature it has been argued that vulnerability is neither a fixed nor an intrinsic characteristic of certain people or groups of people (Enarson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">1998</xref>) or derived from a single social dimension like being poor, rural, woman, or part of a particular (or marginalised) community (Blaikie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2014</xref>). Rather, it depends on social and historical ‘patterns of practices, processes and power relations that render some groups or persons more disadvantaged than others’ (Enarson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">1998</xref>) and more vulnerable to risk and disaster than others (Hilhorst and Bankoff 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2004</xref>). If vulnerability must cover not only differentiated and changing circumstances before, during, and after a disaster or hazard (Blaikie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2014</xref>), but also historically and culturally determined conditions (Enarson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">1998</xref>), then it is less an individual or personal feature and more a structural, relational, and process-oriented condition.
