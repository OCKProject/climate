<p id="Par23" class="p">For a fact, climate events, such as droughts, floods, and changing weather patterns, are already causing problems for climate-dependent livelihoods in small-scale farming and livestock-rearing. In the absence of stabilisation, climate change will exacerbate such problems in the coming decades, especially in southern Africa where projections consistently predict decreasing rainfall, intensified droughts, and increasing variability (Solomon et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2012</xref>). But due to uneven and uncertain impacts it is hard to decide—in a certain area—what is attributable to climate change
