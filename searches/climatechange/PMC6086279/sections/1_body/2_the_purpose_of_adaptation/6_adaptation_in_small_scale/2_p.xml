<p id="Par24" class="p">For local settings, climate change observers and development practitioners often suggest community-based adaptation on the premise that communities have the necessary expertise and networks to initiate appropriate activities to avoid loss or speed up recovery (Dodman and Mitlin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>, p 2). Local knowledge for action is indeed important, but there are conceptual, methodological, and political problems with community-based approaches to climate change, one of which is the common focus on a 
 <italic class="italic">single</italic> challenge (climate change) rather than on the multiple interlocking aspects of vulnerability (Dodman and Mitlin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>, p 3–6). A focus on the local only, at the expense of the national or global level, can also be problematic (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2005</xref>) because it may marginalise or put disproportionate pressure on the local. In addition, the tendency to assume that the ‘community’ is a uniform and inclusive entity may underestimate power, inequality, and diverging interests within it. Nonetheless, research shows that although it is time consuming to assess the merits or limits of community-based adaptation, valuable lessons can be drawn from good initiatives that may potentially be either scaled up (Reid and Schipper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">2014</xref>) or scaled out.
