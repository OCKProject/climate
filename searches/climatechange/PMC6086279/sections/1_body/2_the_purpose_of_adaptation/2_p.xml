<p id="Par16" class="p">Despite substantial investments in research, following from the mounting need for adaptation, practical progress is slow, partly because of the way in which adaptation is framed and understood (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>). Difficulties also arise from the fact that adaptation is inseparable from its socio-ecological context, and, just like development, highly influenced by historical conditions and properties emerging in the cause of action (Wise et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">2014</xref>). Climate change adaptation in a particular setting should thus be prepared through ‘ground work actions’ followed by ‘concrete actions’ including the implementation of institutional guidelines and public awareness (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>).
