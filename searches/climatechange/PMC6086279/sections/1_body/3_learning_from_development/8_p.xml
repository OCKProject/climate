 <italic class="italic">Rights to resources</italic>’: Gendered agency and institutions create differences in capacities, incentives, and preferences for how to manage resources. They also influence means, motives, and conditions for how to contribute to adaptation and sustainability. Knowledge about the environment can be gendered, as can attitudes and abilities that determine how farmers manage natural resources and approach new farming techniques and practices (Doss

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" class="xref">1992</xref>) and may differ between customary or statutory legal institutions (Meinzen-Dick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">2014</xref>). In settings where state-recognised property rights are lacking, gender regimes may instead govern access to, ownership of, and control over resources (Behrman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>). Rights to resources can be temporary if a certain gendered activity or seasonal agricultural practice is associated with a certain resource (Leach
