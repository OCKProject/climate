 <italic class="italic">Neither fair–Nor fixed</italic>’: In the event of human-environmental change, gendered norms in reproduction and production may be challenged. After a climate change event, gender-specific impacts may build on and exacerbate gendered relations and responsibilities, while new obligations arise (OXFAM 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2009</xref>). As an illustration, (women’s) workloads relating to climate change adaptation and mitigation may increase if new tasks are added on to old ones (Blackden and Wodon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2006</xref>). Conversely, work may equalise if labour is re-coded from being feminine to becoming masculine such that men assume women’s tasks and women assume men’s tasks as happened in a severe drought in Cambodia when women and men reinterpreted, shifted and shared work tasks in agriculture to overcome shared difficulties (OXFAM 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2009</xref>; Resurreccion 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">2011</xref>). A crisis may reinforce gender-based disadvantages, but may also entail negotiations and change in seemingly fixed gender relations, thereby in part destabilising gender. In sub-Saharan small-scale farming it has long been noted that changes in the gendering of tasks occur when men exploit new opportunities outside agriculture and women expand their working repertoire in food production—however, men take up women’s tasks (only) when they become profitable (Doss 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2001</xref>; Farnworth and Colverson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2015</xref>).
