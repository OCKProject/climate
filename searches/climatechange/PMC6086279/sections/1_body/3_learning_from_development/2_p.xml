<p id="Par27" class="p">Feminist literature has noticed that the duality of seeing ‘women’ as either vulnerable victims or competent agents and virtues (Arora-Jonsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>)—or both (Chan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>, p 6953)—is repeatedly stressed in debates on environment–development (Leach 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2007</xref>), migration–development (Jackson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">1993</xref>; Piper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">2009</xref>; Chan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>), and security and peace-building (Cohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2008</xref>). Feminists have observed that in everyday practices of how to use space and time, gender is mediated in dynamic processes giving rise to ‘separate spheres’ of varying priorities and privileges such as the public versus the private realm. Within the private realm gendered space is often separated further into areas for cooking, living, and working (Jabeen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2014</xref>) and although gender norms may appear as fixed—reproductive and productive labour are constantly reinterpreted in both theory and practice (Reed and Mitchell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">2003</xref>). This means that owing to institutional instability and fluidity in norms, gender is subject to ongoing socio-cultural negotiations whereby women with intra-household bargaining power become resourceful agents of change (Cruz-Torres and McElwee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2012</xref>; Doss 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2013</xref>).
