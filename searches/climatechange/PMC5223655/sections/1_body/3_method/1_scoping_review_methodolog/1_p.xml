<p class="p">Scoping reviews are a relatively recent method of reviewing evidence-based research, particularly in health and also in other disciplines.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> There is no single definition of what a scoping review consists of. A frequently applied definition is that from Arksey and O'Malley,
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref> which states that the aim of a scoping review is to ‘map rapidly the key concepts underpinning a research area and the main sources and types of evidence available’. This scoping review framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley in 2005 will be applied for this study. There have been a number of studies since 2005, which enhance the initial framework and have advanced our understanding of this methodology and how to produce a more efficient and effective study.
