<p class="p">For more than 28 years, the IPCC has been assessing the potential health risks associated with climate change.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> In the 6 years between 2009 and 2015, climate change has gone from being ‘the biggest global health threat of the 21st century’
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> to potentially ‘the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century’.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> To date, projections of the direction and scope of health consequences induced by climate change involve a degree of uncertainty, which makes it difficult to communicate scientific facts to policymakers or even to the general public.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> Clear information and communication about the health consequences are a critical factor to remove some of this uncertainty. This may also assist in elevating the importance of climate change to ensure that it is a high priority which receives sufficient commitment financially and politically. Climate change presents an enormous governance challenge, with a need for greater new integrated governance structures at national and international levels.
