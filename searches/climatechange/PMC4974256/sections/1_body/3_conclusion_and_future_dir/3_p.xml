<p class="p">Such studies will not be without logistical difficulty, though future developments in technology will help to ease this, including improvements in long-term, sensor-based data gathering. Continued development of DNA-based methods like metabarcoding will assist community-level studies by reducing time-consuming work and taxonomic expertise (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cristescu, 2014</xref>). Results from studies like those suggested above will provide critical information about grassland community responses for use in theoretical modeling approaches such as structural equation modeling, enabling the testing of theories at scales not yet possible experimentally. Such experimental and modeling approaches, carried out with broader geographical and precipitation-scenario representation, will be necessary in order for us to form more accurate predictions about the fate of ecologically important grassland ecosystems under climate change.
