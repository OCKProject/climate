<p class="p">Depending on the underlying water-status of the ecosystem, alterations in rainfall may have generally negative direct and indirect consequences for invertebrates (summarized in

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Changes in precipitation will also have the potential to cause impacts spanning multiple trophic levels, moderating the outcomes of species interactions. Reductions in rainfall may exacerbate the negative effects of herbivores for the plant communities they inhabit, though other players in the system might alter this response (e.g.,
