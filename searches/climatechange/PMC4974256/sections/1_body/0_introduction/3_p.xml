<p class="p">It is in our interest to understand how climate change-driven alterations in precipitation will affect valuable grassland systems and the invertebrate communities they both support and rely on. Over the past 20 years, multiple experiments and observational studies have addressed the responses of grasslands to changes in precipitation, with a subset of these also examining invertebrate responses across a range of precipitation scenarios and spatial scales (summarized in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). To our knowledge, there has been no synthesis of the relevant literature examining insect responses to precipitation changes, making a review of these studies timely. In this mini-review, we look at the effects of altered precipitation patterns – including reductions and increases in average rainfall, and changes in rainfall frequency – on grassland invertebrates and the plant communities they inhabit. We focus on findings from field-based/observational studies and precipitation manipulation experiments conducted in grasslands, including steppe and savannah habitats.
