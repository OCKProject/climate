<p class="p">Invertebrates are the most diverse and abundant constituent of terrestrial ecosystem fauna (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Whiles and Charlton, 2006</xref>) and contribute to shaping grasslands through top-down processes. For instance, herbivores can modify plant species richness by altering competitive dynamics between plant species (

In addition, precipitation changes can have indirect impacts on both plants and invertebrates as the interactions occurring between the two communities are also climate-sensitive; the effect of herbivory on plant diversity varies across precipitation gradients, for instance (
