<p class="p">In general, terrestrial arthropods are sensitive to changes in moisture, given their high surface-to-volume-ratio (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kimura et al., 1985</xref>). Under reduced rainfall, most aboveground arthropods avoid desiccation behaviorally by migrating, hiding in the soil, or, in a few cases, building a shelter (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Berridge, 2012</xref>). Structurally speaking, soft-bodied arthropods (isopods and myriapods) lack the waxy cuticle found in arachnids and insects that prevents or reduces evaporation (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Berridge, 2012</xref>). This, in combination with differences in excretion-related water losses (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horne, 1968</xref>), suggests that soft-bodied arthropods will be more vulnerable to reductions in water availability, and, in some cases, to increases (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sylvain et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, changes in rainfall could be expected to affect hard and soft-bodied groups differently, resulting in shifts in the arthropod community.
