<p class="p">Arthropods that spend all or some of their life stages belowground have evolved behaviors to manage water stress in times of drought and flood (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Verhoef and Witteveen, 1980</xref>). Under reduced water availability, most soil invertebrates combat fluctuating moisture by relocating to places that are more favorable within the soil-matrix. Such movement, however, is dependent on suitable soil moisture and texture (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brust and House, 1990</xref>). Some invertebrates build earthen chambers, controlling the microclimate, similar to shelter-builders aboveground (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnett and Johnson, 2013</xref>). Prolonged drought conditions may favor those species capable of such behaviors. Similarly, larvae with morphological adaptations to flooding may fare better in areas predicted to experience increases in rainfall. Species that have evolved in flood-prone environments in particular, like the cranberry root grub, with water-repellent hairs along its body that can trap air (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">King et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Villani et al., 1999</xref>), may stand to have competitive advantages over flood-intolerant species. Thus, invertebrates both above and belowground have evolved a range of behavioral and morphological adaptations to alterations in water availability. Differences in the use of such strategies between species and functional groups will likely lead to alterations in invertebrate community composition.
