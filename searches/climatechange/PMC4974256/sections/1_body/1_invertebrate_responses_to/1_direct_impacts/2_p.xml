<p class="p">On the other end of the spectrum, average increases in rainfall may negatively impact arthropods by disrupting flight, reducing foraging efficiency and increasing migration times (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kasper et al., 2008</xref>). Some arthropods can vary their behavior to combat the effects of extreme rainfall events and flooding by shelter-seeking and utilizing submersion tolerance strategies (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lambeets et al., 2008</xref>). The effects of increased rainfall on arthropods are also dependent on invertebrate morphology and are group-specific, with larger winged insects like Lepidopterans having a much higher degree of ‘unwettability’ (i.e., requiring greater volumes of water to become wet) than smaller winged insects (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wagner et al., 1996</xref>). Altered rainfall frequency can be positive or negative for invertebrates depending on the size of the event (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nielsen and Ball, 2015</xref>), but on the whole is expected to impact more rain-sensitive orders like Lepidoptera (
