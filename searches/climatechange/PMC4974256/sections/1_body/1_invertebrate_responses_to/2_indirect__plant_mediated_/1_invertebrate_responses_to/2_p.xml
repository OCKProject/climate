<p class="p">Increases in average precipitation (to a degree – the negative effects of flooding in grasslands have been reviewed elsewhere – see 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Plum (2005)</xref>) may result in benefits to invertebrate herbivores, except in cases where increased moisture facilitates pathogens and disease (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grant and Villani, 2003</xref>). On the whole, increases in precipitation lead to increases in ANPP (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, studies have reported improved grasshopper nymph survival (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al., 2009</xref>) and increased abundance and richness of grasshoppers (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lenhart et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to the increases in grasshopper abundance reported in 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lenhart et al. (2015)</xref> two other studies reported reductions in grasshopper survival under similar increased rainfall treatments (
