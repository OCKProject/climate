<p class="p">There is strong evidence in the literature for resource quantity-driven changes in invertebrate herbivore populations under altered precipitation regimes. Reduced rainfall results in reduced plant biomass, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), forage quality and cover, with increases in canopy light penetration and root:shoot ratios (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), leaving less plant biomass to support herbivores; however there is strong evidence that this response is ecosystem dependent (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, declines have been reported – across various ecotypes – in the abundances of Orthoptera (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mariotte et al., 2016</xref>); belowground herbivores (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Staley et al., 2007</xref>); and across herbivore communities generally (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Plant quality changes could also play a role in these declines. In a feeding experiment, army worm larvae reared on droughted Yorkshire fog grass took longer to develop and had higher mortality rates than those feeding on non-droughted grass, due to lower soluble protein content (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Walter et al., 2012</xref>). While some trends can be identified in the responses of invertebrates to reductions in rainfall, there is a high degree of variation between species. For instance, gastropod species in a UK study had highly individual responses to changes in water availability, with some benefitting from drought and others instead occurring in greater abundance under supplemented rainfall (
