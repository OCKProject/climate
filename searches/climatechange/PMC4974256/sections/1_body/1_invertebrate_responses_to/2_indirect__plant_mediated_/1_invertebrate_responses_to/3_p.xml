<p class="p">Hence, a recurrent theme in the literature is that the responses of herbivorous invertebrates to altered precipitation will likely be idiosyncratic in nature, making it difficult to make generalized predictions about the directions of their responses under different scenarios (

The responses of herbivores to both reduced and increased water availability are likely to be linked to the responses of their individual food-plant(s), as well as the invertebrate specie’s own physiological precipitation optimum (
