<p class="p">In a separate study, detritivorous tenebrionid beetles belowground had negative effects on the abundances of generalist sap sucking and chewing herbivores when summer precipitation was supplemented, similar to the findings of

In contrast, the presence of belowground herbivores had positive impacts on aboveground leaf-mining flies, restoring their pupal weight and development time to ambient levels, when reared under drought conditions on milk-thistle (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Staley et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that belowground organisms could serve to moderate the effects of reduced or increased water availability on aboveground herbivores, which may otherwise be expected to decrease or increase in abundance, respectively, in response to such rainfall regimes. As with the responses of individual species, the directions of the responses of the interactions between multiple species may also prove to be species- and system-specific. Further work is needed in the area to determine whether or not generalizations can be made, and to determine whether other interactions such as competition may also be affected by alterations in precipitation.
