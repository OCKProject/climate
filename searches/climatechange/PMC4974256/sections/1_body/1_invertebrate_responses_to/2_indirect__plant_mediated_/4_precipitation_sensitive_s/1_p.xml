<p class="p">The idiosyncratic nature of invertebrate responses can be at least partially explained by complex precipitation-driven alterations in the interactions occurring between species within the system. The handful of studies which have tackled pairwise species interactions under precipitation manipulations have found complex, unpredictable responses with the potential to affect multiple trophic levels. For instance, spatially separated above- and belowground herbivores may influence each other through their effects on the shared host plant, such as by altering secondary chemistry (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Staley et al. (2007)</xref> found that enhanced summer rainfall increased the abundance of leaf mining moths on wild basil, but not when root herbivores were present. The negative effects of root herbivores on leaf miner pupal size reduced the parasitism rates of moths above ground, indicating the potential for precipitation-altered species interactions to have knock-on consequences for higher trophic levels.
