<p class="p">The responses of a grassland plant community to alterations in rainfall depend on the type of grassland (i.e., average water state â€“ mesic, xeric etc.; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heisler-White et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the plant functional types (PFTs) that dominate the system (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andrey et al., 2014</xref>). For example, under altered rainfall frequency, with longer dry periods between more intense rainfall events, mesic grasslands generally experience a decrease in ANPP, whereas xeric grasslands show an increase (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heisler-White et al., 2009</xref>). In terms of PFTs, grasslands dominated by C

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> counterparts (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wilcox et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that herbivorous insects consume relatively more C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plants in years with reduced rainfall frequencies (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warne et al., 2010</xref>), possibly due to improved quality or increased quantities of these plants under such scenarios. Thus, we could expect that reorganizations occurring at the plant community level in response to altered rainfall regimes will have consequences for herbivores, particularly for specialist feeders which may be reliant on the presence of just one or two plant species.
