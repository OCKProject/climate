<p class="p">So far, experimental evidence directly linking precipitation-mediated changes in plant diversity to changes in the herbivore community is lacking. However, a 5-year field experiment by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Suttle et al. (2007)</xref> showed that whilst increased summer rainfall enhanced plant biomass, increased dominance and reduced grassland plant species richness had eventual negative consequences for the invertebrate community. Specifically, herbivore and consumer abundance declined and the invertebrate food web became simplified, potentially pointing to the loss of more specialized herbivores. This study demonstrates the importance of longer-term studies in detecting plant community shifts as opposed to more immediate biomass responses. Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wilcox et al. (2016)</xref> recently showed that short-term plant community shifts in response to increased water availability may be misleading when considering shifts over a decadal time scale.
