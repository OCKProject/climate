 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buchholz et al. (2013)</xref> found reductions in semi-dry grassland spider and carabid diversity and abundance under water-limited conditions. However, at a similar site 3 years earlier, the same authors found no change in spider species richness, composition or abundance under precipitation manipulation (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buchholz et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, in a Chinese steppe, reduced rainfall caused declines in herbivore abundance with no corresponding decline in secondary consumers (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Clearly, as with herbivores, there will be differences in the individual responses of higher trophic levels to changes in precipitation patterns.
