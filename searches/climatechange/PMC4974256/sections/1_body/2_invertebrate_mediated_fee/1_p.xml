 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Coupe et al., 2009</xref>), though their impacts on plant species richness, for instance, may be stronger during herbivore outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Olff and Ritchie, 1998</xref>). Altered precipitation has the capacity to change the relative strength of the interactions occurring between grassland plant and invertebrate communities, by altering the abundance and composition of species within the system. In a Canadian grassland, invertebrates caused short-term reductions in plant cover, increases in root mortality and altered plant composition compared with pesticide treated plots (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Coupe et al., 2009</xref>). The effects of the invertebrate community only became apparent under naturally occurring drought conditions. This suggests that invertebrate herbivores may exacerbate the negative effects of drought for grassland plants, and that grasslands may become more vulnerable to herbivores under drought.
