<p class="p">In an American temperate old-field study, experimentally increased rainfall caused declines in grasshopper abundance, which translated into a 15% reduction in grasshopper-inflicted plant damage for every 1 cm of increase in mean monthly precipitation (

Conversely, in a limestone grassland, the plant community sustained an increase in biomass under supplemented rainfall scenarios, despite a significant increase in the abundance of Auchenorrhyncha herbivores (leaf, plant, and frog hoppers; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Masters et al., 1998</xref>). Assuming that this greater abundance of insects inflicted comparable levels of damage on a per capita basis as those in ambient plots, this would suggest that grassland plants may be able to maintain increased growth despite higher levels of herbivory under increased rainfall scenarios. These two studies demonstrate that the strength of indirect, invertebrate community-mediated effects of altered precipitation on grasslands will depend on the identities of both the plant community and invertebrate species involved.
