To understand how climate change is likely to alter bird communities in parks, we used species distribution models relating North American Breeding Bird Survey (summer) and Audubon Christmas Bird Count (winter) observations to climate data from the early 2000s and projected to 2041&#x02013;2070 (hereafter, mid-century) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. We analyzed climate suitability projections over time for 513 species across 274 national parks, classifying them as improving, worsening, stable, potential colonization, and potential extirpation. U.S. national parks are projected to become increasingly important for birds in the coming decades as potential colonizations exceed extirpations in 62&#x02013;100% of parks, with an average ratio of potential colonizations to extirpations of 4.1 in winter and 1.4 in summer under RCP8.5. Average species turnover is 23% in both summer and winter under RCP8.5. Species turnover (Bray-Curtis) and potential colonization and extirpation rates are positively correlated with latitude in the contiguous 48 states. Parks in the Midwest and Northeast are expected to see particularly high rates of change. All patterns are more extreme under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6. Based on the ratio of potential colonization and extirpation, parks were classified into overall trend groups associated with specific climate-informed conservation strategies. Substantial change to bird and ecological communities is anticipated in coming decades, and current thinking suggests managing towards a forward-looking concept of ecological integrity that accepts change and novel ecological conditions, rather than focusing management goals exclusively on maintaining or restoring a static set of historical conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007516</institution-id><institution>National Park Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P16AC00699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilsey</surname><given-names>Chad B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the National Park Service&#x02019;s Natural Resource Stewardship and Science Directorate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1778/index.htm">https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1778/index.htm</ext-link>) under Cooperative Agreement P16AC00699.

However, despite protection within the NPS, national park ecosystems face numerous modern threats including invasive species, pollution, regional development and habitat fragmentation, modification of natural processes, and climate change [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among these, climate change warrants particular research attention because its impacts are (1) relatively new and not fully understood, (2) pervasive, and (3) likely to influence impacts of other stressors. Ongoing climate change has brought warmer annual mean temperature, winter lows, and summer maximums [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], such that the vast majority of parks are already at the extreme warm edge of historical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Precipitation patterns are also changing [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and collectively these changes have the potential to modify species assemblages and ecological processes within national parks [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Birds are useful indicators of ecological change because they are highly mobile, responsive, and generally conspicuous. They are also popular with visitors to national parks; bird-watching is a $107-billion industry in the U.S. that involves 47 million people annually [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Birds are among the most studied taxa, and numerous studies have documented climate change impacts and responses in birds [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including phenological mismatches in resources and breeding [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], warm-adapted species increasing in abundance relative to cool-adapted species [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and regional endemics declining more sharply with warming [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some populations may already be experiencing direct impacts from changes in the frequency of extreme weather events [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], for example, through elevated mortality during heat waves [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A global synthesis of peer-reviewed research suggests that one in five bird species has experienced negative impacts of climate change in some portion of its range [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], including local extirpation [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Local extirpation is synonymous with range contraction unless accompanied by expansion (via colonization) elsewhere, in which case the impact would be range shift. Bird range boundaries are already shifting in elevation [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and latitude [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, and over the past 60 years, U.S. bird species&#x02019; northern range boundaries have generally expanded while eastern and western boundaries have contracted [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Future climate change poses an intensifying threat to many bird species, with global to local implications. A global assessment of climate change vulnerability based on climate change exposure and trait-based measures of sensitivity and adaptive capacity (considering traits such as habitat specialization, lifespan, dispersal capacity, and fecundity) suggests 24&#x02013;50% of birds are highly vulnerable to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the U.S. and Canada, a model-based assessment of climate sensitivity suggests 21% of bird species are highly sensitive to climate change, such that they may lose half of their climatically suitable ranges by mid-century [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the Great Lakes region of North America, 26% of 46 migratory species were classified as vulnerable to climate change when their full annual cycle was considered [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Locally, 36% of 358 birds in California were classified as vulnerable to climate change with 72% of the 29 state or federally listed species among them [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A changing climate will impact a park&#x02019;s suitability for species, with corresponding effects on community composition and relative abundances. Climate suitability for a species is characterized using ecological niche models, which correlate species occurrence data with environmental covariates including climate [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Model predictions can be transferred into geographic space to map species distributions under projected future climate [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Estimates of climate suitability may correlate with relative abundance [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and changes in climate suitability track population trends over time [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, projections of changing climate suitability can provide insight into how populations and assemblages may respond to future climate change.</p><p>The threat of climate change to birds is not only a novel and pervasive challenge to a charismatic taxon, but also to traditional conservation goals and the expectation that protected areas can retain historical ecological components and processes. Understanding the future of birds in parks can inform long-term park management and public engagement. Here, we characterized projected changes in climate suitability for 513 species of birds across 274 national parks in the United States, grouping species within each park based on their projected trends in climate suitability. We quantified potential species turnover across parks and examined patterns at regional and continental scales. Finally, we classified parks into trend groups based on projected change in community composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study sites</title><p>Our analysis encompassed 277 national parks in the continental U.S. that fall under the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program&#x02019;s natural resource park designation and represent 49 of 50 U.S. states, with the exception being Hawai&#x02018;i.

Potential colonization exceeds potential extirpation in more than 60% of parks under both emissions pathways, and if projected extirpations and colonizations were realized, the average park would have 29% more species in winter and 6% more species in summer. While not assessed directly here, the likelihood of these projections occurring may be higher for birds than for other taxa. Birds are highly mobile, making the prospect of range expansion more realistic [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Many species are also strongly responsive to climatic factors, with distributions that shift from year to year in response to interannual variation in weather [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Of course, colonization requires not just suitable climate, but also suitable habitat. Vegetation, in particular, may lag behind, or fail to follow, climate, such that species dependent on mature trees may not find suitable habitat until and unless that vegetation can establish itself [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alternatively, some birds may colonize new regions by showing behavioral plasticity, a form of phenotypic plasticity in which a species demonstrates the ability to change behavior in response to climatic or other drivers of environmental change [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Phenotypic plasticity may allow a species, for example, to switch to newly encountered species and vegetation types for foraging and nesting, though with potential biotic costs (e.g., reduced nest success [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Regardless of the mechanism, colonization in nearly all compass directions along range boundaries has already been observed across bird species [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, many of the potential colonizations of national parks projected above are likely to occur, or are already occurring. The Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (<italic>Polioptila caerulea</italic>), which has expanded north significantly in recent decades [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], is an example.

Also of note here is the relatively small proportion (&#x0003c;3%) of introduced species contributing to potential colonization projections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190557.s006">S4 Table</xref>), perhaps because most introduced birds, being highly mobile, have realized their niche and/or are naturalized and are no longer expanding their range.

Or, complete residency could result if selective pressures for shortened migration persist as expected under climate change [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Regional and latitudinal patterns</title><p>Projected future changes in community composition varied by region and latitude. In particular, the Southeast and Pacific West had low rates of projected turnover, whereas the Midwest, National Capital, and Northeast had high rates of projected turnover, in both summer and winter. These patterns are consistent with projections of future temperature and precipitation extremes across the U.S. under climate change, which identify more change at higher latitudes in the contiguous U.S., particularly around the Great Lakes, and less change along the Southeast, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Low projected turnover in the southeastern U.S. may reflect the impacts of a documented &#x0201c;warming hole&#x0201d; in that region in which both anthropogenic and natural forces combine to reduce warming relative to other regions [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], while high rates of change in the Midwest reflect high projected climate velocities in the mid-continent [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Climate velocity, the speed needed to track constant climate conditions, is typically highest in regions with low topographic relief. Similarly, projected biotic velocity, a species-specific measure that reflects the speed required to track constant climate suitability, is high on average for birds in the Midwestern U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The Midwest region is also under pressure from land-use change [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], increasing the value of national parks, national wildlife refuges, and other protected areas for the natural habitats they provide. Climatic connectivity, the ability of species to move through the landscape in order to track constant climate, is lowest in the Midwestern U.S. due to the overall degree of land-cover modification and paucity of natural habitats [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Higher latitudes in the contiguous U.S. (~40&#x02013;49&#x000b0;N) had significantly higher rates of potential extirpation and projected turnover in summer, and higher rates of potential colonization, potential extirpation, and projected turnover in winter. Consistent with findings at the continental scale [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], projected changes in community composition are highest at higher latitudes, and are driven by northward shifts in climate suitability and differences among regions, specifically relatively high projected change in the Midwest and Northeast regions and low change in the Southeast.</p><p>An underrepresentation of Mexican bird species in this study may contribute to low projected change at southern latitudes (results not shown). However, significant latitudinal trends in rates of potential colonization and turnover remained after removing from the analysis southern parks likely to experience colonizations from Mexico and Central America. This finding suggests the latitudinal trend is robust to data limitations in the southern U.S.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Management implications</title><p>Protected area networks such as the U.S. National Park System are the focus of landscape-scale conservation [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our analysis reinforces that parks are critical for bird conservation and likely to increase in value with climate change. Furthermore, park trend groups can associate patterns in potential colonization and extirpation across the National Park System with broad suggested climate change adaptation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to increase the future effectiveness of the system as a conservation network for birds as well as plants and other wildlife. The assignments of parks to trend groups are relative, such that suggestions for one site consider the degree of projected change elsewhere, and thus can help each park contribute coherently to the goals of the entire park system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190557.s007">S5 Table</xref>). Climate-informed conservation strategies focus on increasing habitat connectivity to facilitate movement [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as well as habitat restoration, protected area expansion, and disturbance-regime management [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These actions might promote resistance (i.e., holding back climate-induced changes to protect highly valued resources), resilience (i.e., improving the capacity to recover after disturbances related to climate change), or facilitation (i.e., facilitating the transition to new ecological conditions) [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Management and conservation actions within parks that fall in the low and intermediate change groups can best support landscape-scale bird conservation by emphasizing habitat restoration, maintaining natural disturbance regimes, and reducing other stressors. Parks within one of the three high change groups (high turnover, colonization, or extirpation) can do so by focusing on actions that increase species&#x02019; ability to respond to environmental change, such as increasing the amount of potential habitat, managing the matrix surrounding the park to improve connectivity, managing the disturbance regime, and possibly more intensive management actions, such as captive breeding, reintroduction, and translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190557.s007">S5 Table</xref>). Monitoring to identify changes in bird communities will facilitate the implementation of appropriate management responses. The NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] provides a monitoring framework for validating climate change projections and informing adaptive management in response to climate change. To maximize success, these conservation actions should be implemented within the context of landscape design, a partnership-driven process that aligns conservation goals with stakeholder values and participation [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Caveats</title><p>Ecological niche model projections include many inherent uncertainties [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] relevant to this study. Significant changes in climate suitability, as measured here, will not always result in a species response for multiple reasons, including biotic interactions known to both inhibit and facilitate species&#x02019; colonization and extirpation [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; species&#x02019; evolutionary adaptive capacity (i.e., the ability to evolve), life history traits [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., behavioral adjustments [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]) mediating responses to climate change; and absence of ecological processes (e.g., that create/maintain habitats or impact demography) in the projections [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Finally, the TSS-based threshold used to distinguish between improving/worsening conditions and potential colonization/extirpation was selected to balance errors of omission and commission in the models themselves, but results in some imperfections [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and is not the only thresholding method. Ultimately, monitoring is the only way to validate these projections and should inform any on-the-ground conservation action.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Birds are early responders to climate change and are easily observed and recorded; their responses, including range shifts and behavioral plasticity, are already widely documented [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. National parks, which have an average projected turnover of ~20%, will likely experience considerable change in bird communities. Proactive action is essential to safeguard the existing investment in conservation represented by the U.S. National Park System, as well as to preserve the full complement of management options for the future [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A recent re-examination of the Leopold Report, a seminal guide to resource management in national parks, recognizes the importance of &#x0201c;stewardship for continuous change&#x0201d; in preserving natural resources for future generations, and stresses preserving ecological integrity (i.e., &#x0201c;the quality of ecosystems that are largely self-sustaining and self-regulating&#x0201d;) rather than historical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Managers thus face three choices in response to ongoing climate change and associated ecological responses&#x02014;resist, accommodate, or actively direct ecological change toward specific new desired conditions [<xref rid="pone.0190557.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Effective conservation in the face of climate change will require landscape-level thinking (including consultation with regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in cases of federally protected species) that applies all of these approaches and allows species to persist or track climate. Projections of potential avian community change along with the management recommendations presented here provide a roadmap for informing adaptive management across the network of national parks in the United States.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190557.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Trends of improving, stable, and worsening species across 274 U.S. national parks.</title><p>Results for seasonal differences, latitudinal trends, and regional differences are presented for improving, stable, and worsening species.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190557.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190557.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Breakdown of park trends by NPS geographic region in summer under RCP8.5.</title><p>The total number of parks in each region is show above each bar.
