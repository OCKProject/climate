  <title class="title">Example of projected bird assemblage changes by mid-century at Golden Gate National Recreation Area.</title>
  <p class="p">Under RCP8.5 in summer, climate suitability is projected to improve for the Great Egret (
   <italic class="italic">Ardea alba</italic>), remain stable for the Nuttall’s Woodpecker (
   <italic class="italic">Picoides nuttallii</italic>), and worsen for the Wilson’s Warbler (
   <italic class="italic">Cardellina pusilla</italic>). Climate suitability is at risk of disappearing for the American Robin (
   <italic class="italic">Turdus migratorius</italic>), potentially resulting in extirpation from the park. Although the Blue Grosbeak (
   <italic class="italic">Passerina caerulea</italic>) is not currently found in the park, climate is projected to become suitable for this species, potentially resulting in local colonization. Bird illustrations by Kenn Kaufman.
