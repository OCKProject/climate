  <title class="title">Projected species turnover from the early 2000s to mid-century across seven NPS geographic regions and 274 U.S. national parks.</title>
  <p class="p">Bray-Curtis turnover rates under RCP8.5 are calculated under the assumption that all potential extirpations and colonizations are realized, with 0 being no change and 1 being complete turnover. Circle sizes represent rates in summer, and colors represent rates in winter. Breaks in classes are based on quartiles. Alaska is shown in the inset on the left and the National Capital region is shown in the inset on the right. The chart on the right shows the mean and standard error of the mean turnover index by NPS geographic region, and the dotted lines show the mean turnover index across regions in both summer (0.23 ± SE 0.004) and winter (0.23 ± 0.006). Analysis of variance indicated significant difference among regions in summer (F
