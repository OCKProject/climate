  <title class="title">Projected species composition changes from the early 2000s to mid-century across 274 U.S. national parks.</title>
  <p class="p">Potential (A) colonizations and (B) extirpations in summer and winter under RCP8.5 are shown as a proportion of the current total number of species. Circle sizes represent proportions in summer, and colors represent proportions in winter. Breaks in classes are based on quartiles. Alaska is shown in the inset on the left and the National Capital region is shown in the inset on the right.</p>
