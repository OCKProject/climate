<p class="p">With a warming climate, bird species may increasingly find suitable conditions year-round in parks where those conditions currently occur only in summer. Under the high-emissions pathway, an average of 7.1 ± 0.2 species per park (range 0–21) might find suitable conditions year-round. This number drops to 4.8 ± 0.2 species (range 0–18) under the low-emissions pathway, which is significantly lower than the high-emissions pathway (
