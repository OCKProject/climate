<p class="p">Trends in projected future climate suitability suggest that parks could support more bird species by mid-century than they do today in both summer and winter (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190557.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Under RCP8.5, parks are projected to see an average of 22.5 ± 0.4 potential species colonizations and 17.4 ± 0.6 potential species extirpations per park in summer; and 42.1 ± 0.7 potential species colonizations and 10.3 ± 0.3 potential species extirpations per park in winter. Species richness within parks would increase in the future if all projected climate gains in summer (mean ratio of potential future to current species richness under RCP8.5 = 1.07:1) and winter (mean ratio = 1.34:1) were realized. Under RCP8.5, the number of parks where potential colonization represents &gt;25% of their current species count outweighs the number of parks where potential extirpation represents &gt;25% in both seasons (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190557.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The degree of projected change was less drastic under RCP2.6, but nevertheless potential colonizations exceeded potential extirpations in more than 60% of parks, regardless of season or emissions pathway (
