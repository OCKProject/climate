<p class="p">We characterized the implications of future climate change for species within each park based on two criteria: (1) an estimated trend in climatic suitability and (2) whether climate suitability crosses a threshold, suggesting a higher potential for colonization or local extirpation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190557.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). For the first criterion, we fit a linear regression (

Predictions to the intermediate time period were included to improve estimates of trend but are not presented as results. The four suitability values (one for each GCM) capture the variation in projected climate suitability at each time period, and regression finds the average trend across GCMs and over time. To determine the direction and significance of the change in climate suitability over time, we used the coefficient (

 </sub>) of the year term to assess whether the slope of each linear model was significantly different from zero. Climate suitability for each species within each park was characterized as improving, stable, or worsening (

For the second criterion, we assessed whether climate suitability values cross the TSS-derived suitability threshold in either direction: climate that transitions from unsuitable to suitable equates to potential colonization, and climate that transitions from suitable to unsuitable equates to potential extirpation (
