<p class="p">We explored latitudinal trends in climate suitability, using park as the sampling unit. Simple linear regressions were used to analyze potential colonization and extirpation, and species turnover rates (dependent variables) as a function of latitude (independent variable). Parks in Alaska were removed from this analysis due to the data gap in the higher latitudes falling within Canada.</p>
