<p class="p">We explored how species assemblages may change in each park over time (i.e., species turnover) by generating a species list for each park for the present and future time periods. We assumed that climate conditions becoming suitable or unsuitable for a species—i.e., potential colonization and extirpation—translate to realized colonization or extirpation. To quantify species turnover, we calculated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index within each park, season, and emissions pathway using vegdist from the R package vegan [
