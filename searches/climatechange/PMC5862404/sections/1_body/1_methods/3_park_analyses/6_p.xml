<p class="p">To understand how projected changes (i.e., colonization and extirpation) in individual parks compare with other parks in the system, we classified parks into relative park trend groups based on the ratio of projected colonizations to extirpations in summer under RCP8.5 following Hole et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Plotting projected colonizations and extirpations against each other for all parks, we divided the area of the graph into five sectors based on quartiles (

Each park was then classified into one of five categories according to the sector on the graph into which it falls: high turnover, high potential colonization, high potential extirpation, intermediate change (for parks within a quartile of the median along the two axes), and low change (
