<p class="p">We treated parks as the unit of analysis to assess projected changes in climate suitability. For a species to be considered for analysis in a particular park, climate in the park had to be suitable for the species either in the present or by mid-century. The true skill statistic (TSS), which maximizes true presences and true absences in species distribution models and is unaffected by prevalence [
