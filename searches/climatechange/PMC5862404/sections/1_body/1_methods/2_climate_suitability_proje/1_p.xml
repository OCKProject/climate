<p class="p">Projections of future climate suitability for each species were based on a suite of previously published species distribution models for North American birds [

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Models of summer and winter distributions were trained on observations from the North American Breeding Bird Survey [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and Audubon Christmas Bird Count [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] using 17 bioclimatic variables as predictors (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190557.s003" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). We took these seasonal distribution models [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and updated their projections for two future greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration trajectories—RCP2.6 (Representative Concentration Pathway) and RCP8.5—representing the low and high extremes of potential future greenhouse gas trajectories. RCP2.6 is the most stringent mitigation scenario, whereas RCP8.5 most closely approximates a continuation of the current pathway of rising emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Four CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) general circulation models (GCMs; CanESM2, CESM1/CAM5, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC-ESM) were used to capture the extremes and average climate warming possibilities across North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. A 10-km buffer was applied to each park to match the spatial resolution of the species distribution models (10 x 10 km) [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], and climate suitability for each park was taken as the average of all cells encompassed by the park and buffer. Climate suitability was estimated for the present (2000–2010), and projected to 2041–2070 (hereafter, mid-century) across the continental U.S. and Canada. We present results averaging climate suitability values across GCMs between the present and mid-century, considering each emissions trajectory separately. We present results primarily from RCP8.5 (hereafter, the high-emissions pathway) as the scenario most consistent with current GHG emissions rates, and make comparisons to RCP2.6 (hereafter, the low-emissions pathway) as a contrasting best-case scenario for GHG emissions reductions [
