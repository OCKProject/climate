<p class="p">Birds are useful indicators of ecological change because they are highly mobile, responsive, and generally conspicuous. They are also popular with visitors to national parks; bird-watching is a $107-billion industry in the U.S. that involves 47 million people annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Birds are among the most studied taxa, and numerous studies have documented climate change impacts and responses in birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], including phenological mismatches in resources and breeding [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], warm-adapted species increasing in abundance relative to cool-adapted species [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and regional endemics declining more sharply with warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Some populations may already be experiencing direct impacts from changes in the frequency of extreme weather events [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], for example, through elevated mortality during heat waves [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. A global synthesis of peer-reviewed research suggests that one in five bird species has experienced negative impacts of climate change in some portion of its range [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], including local extirpation [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Local extirpation is synonymous with range contraction unless accompanied by expansion (via colonization) elsewhere, in which case the impact would be range shift. Bird range boundaries are already shifting in elevation [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and latitude [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, and over the past 60 years, U.S. bird species’ northern range boundaries have generally expanded while eastern and western boundaries have contracted [
