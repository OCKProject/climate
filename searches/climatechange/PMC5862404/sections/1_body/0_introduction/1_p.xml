<p class="p">The U.S. National Park Service (NPS), the first of its kind in the world, offers uniquely strong legal and institutional protections that “preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources” as mandated by its founding legislation [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, despite protection within the NPS, national park ecosystems face numerous modern threats including invasive species, pollution, regional development and habitat fragmentation, modification of natural processes, and climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Among these, climate change warrants particular research attention because its impacts are (1) relatively new and not fully understood, (2) pervasive, and (3) likely to influence impacts of other stressors. Ongoing climate change has brought warmer annual mean temperature, winter lows, and summer maximums [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], such that the vast majority of parks are already at the extreme warm edge of historical conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Precipitation patterns are also changing [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and collectively these changes have the potential to modify species assemblages and ecological processes within national parks [
