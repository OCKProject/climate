<p class="p">Therefore, many of the potential colonizations of national parks projected above are likely to occur, or are already occurring. The Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], is an example. It did not breed in South Dakota in 2001, but was detected breeding for the first time in southwestern South Dakota (Badlands and Wind Cave National Parks) in 2014 and 150 km northwest in northeastern Wyoming (Devils Tower National Monument) in 2015 (pers. comm. K. Gallo). Also of note here is the relatively small proportion (&lt;3%) of introduced species contributing to potential colonization projections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190557.s006" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>), perhaps because most introduced birds, being highly mobile, have realized their niche and/or are naturalized and are no longer expanding their range. Of the nine introduced species in the analysis, only one, the Eurasian Collared Dove (
