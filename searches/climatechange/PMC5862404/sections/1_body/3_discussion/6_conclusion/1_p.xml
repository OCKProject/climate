<p class="p">Birds are early responders to climate change and are easily observed and recorded; their responses, including range shifts and behavioral plasticity, are already widely documented [

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. National parks, which have an average projected turnover of ~20%, will likely experience considerable change in bird communities. Proactive action is essential to safeguard the existing investment in conservation represented by the U.S. National Park System, as well as to preserve the full complement of management options for the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. A recent re-examination of the Leopold Report, a seminal guide to resource management in national parks, recognizes the importance of “stewardship for continuous change” in preserving natural resources for future generations, and stresses preserving ecological integrity (i.e., “the quality of ecosystems that are largely self-sustaining and self-regulating”) rather than historical conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Managers thus face three choices in response to ongoing climate change and associated ecological responses—resist, accommodate, or actively direct ecological change toward specific new desired conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Effective conservation in the face of climate change will require landscape-level thinking (including consultation with regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in cases of federally protected species) that applies all of these approaches and allows species to persist or track climate. Projections of potential avian community change along with the management recommendations presented here provide a roadmap for informing adaptive management across the network of national parks in the United States.
