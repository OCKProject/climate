 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Our analysis reinforces that parks are critical for bird conservation and likely to increase in value with climate change. Furthermore, park trend groups can associate patterns in potential colonization and extirpation across the National Park System with broad suggested climate change adaptation strategies [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] to increase the future effectiveness of the system as a conservation network for birds as well as plants and other wildlife. The assignments of parks to trend groups are relative, such that suggestions for one site consider the degree of projected change elsewhere, and thus can help each park contribute coherently to the goals of the entire park system (

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. These actions might promote resistance (i.e., holding back climate-induced changes to protect highly valued resources), resilience (i.e., improving the capacity to recover after disturbances related to climate change), or facilitation (i.e., facilitating the transition to new ecological conditions) [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Management and conservation actions within parks that fall in the low and intermediate change groups can best support landscape-scale bird conservation by emphasizing habitat restoration, maintaining natural disturbance regimes, and reducing other stressors. Parks within one of the three high change groups (high turnover, colonization, or extirpation) can do so by focusing on actions that increase species’ ability to respond to environmental change, such as increasing the amount of potential habitat, managing the matrix surrounding the park to improve connectivity, managing the disturbance regime, and possibly more intensive management actions, such as captive breeding, reintroduction, and translocation (

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] provides a monitoring framework for validating climate change projections and informing adaptive management in response to climate change. To maximize success, these conservation actions should be implemented within the context of landscape design, a partnership-driven process that aligns conservation goals with stakeholder values and participation [
