<p class="p">Ecological niche model projections include many inherent uncertainties [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] relevant to this study. Significant changes in climate suitability, as measured here, will not always result in a species response for multiple reasons, including biotic interactions known to both inhibit and facilitate species’ colonization and extirpation [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]; species’ evolutionary adaptive capacity (i.e., the ability to evolve), life history traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] and phenotypic plasticity (e.g., behavioral adjustments [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]) mediating responses to climate change; and absence of ecological processes (e.g., that create/maintain habitats or impact demography) in the projections [

 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Finally, the TSS-based threshold used to distinguish between improving/worsening conditions and potential colonization/extirpation was selected to balance errors of omission and commission in the models themselves, but results in some imperfections [
