<p class="p">Projected future changes in community composition varied by region and latitude. In particular, the Southeast and Pacific West had low rates of projected turnover, whereas the Midwest, National Capital, and Northeast had high rates of projected turnover, in both summer and winter. These patterns are consistent with projections of future temperature and precipitation extremes across the U.S. under climate change, which identify more change at higher latitudes in the contiguous U.S., particularly around the Great Lakes, and less change along the Southeast, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Low projected turnover in the southeastern U.S. may reflect the impacts of a documented “warming hole” in that region in which both anthropogenic and natural forces combine to reduce warming relative to other regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], while high rates of change in the Midwest reflect high projected climate velocities in the mid-continent [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Climate velocity, the speed needed to track constant climate conditions, is typically highest in regions with low topographic relief. Similarly, projected biotic velocity, a species-specific measure that reflects the speed required to track constant climate suitability, is high on average for birds in the Midwestern U.S. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The Midwest region is also under pressure from land-use change [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], increasing the value of national parks, national wildlife refuges, and other protected areas for the natural habitats they provide. Climatic connectivity, the ability of species to move through the landscape in order to track constant climate, is lowest in the Midwestern U.S. due to the overall degree of land-cover modification and paucity of natural habitats [
