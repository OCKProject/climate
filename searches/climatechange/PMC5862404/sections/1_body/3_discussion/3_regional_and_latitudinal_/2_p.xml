<p class="p">Higher latitudes in the contiguous U.S. (~40–49°N) had significantly higher rates of potential extirpation and projected turnover in summer, and higher rates of potential colonization, potential extirpation, and projected turnover in winter. Consistent with findings at the continental scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0190557.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], projected changes in community composition are highest at higher latitudes, and are driven by northward shifts in climate suitability and differences among regions, specifically relatively high projected change in the Midwest and Northeast regions and low change in the Southeast.
