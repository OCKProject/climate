  <p class="p">Means Â± 1 SE of the number of species potentially colonizing (No. Col.) and potentially being extirpated (No. Ext.) are shown. Asterisks and signs indicate regions where the mean number of potential colonizations or extirpations in a park is significantly higher (*+) or lower (*-) than the mean across all parks. Colonizations exceeded or were not statistically different from extirpations across regions and emissions pathways. The mean proportions of colonizations and extirpations are shown in
