 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic>. Since the anthozoan response to changes in pH is related to salinity, its northernmost distribution should increase due to a weaker influence of rivers and a decline in the temperature range under the RCP 2.6 scenario. On the other hand, decreases in salinity and pH and more intense temperature fluctuations in the southeast and east of Brazil would result in a loss of suitable areas, except along the coast of Cape Frio in southeastern Brazil. This result may be associated with upwelling in this region (
