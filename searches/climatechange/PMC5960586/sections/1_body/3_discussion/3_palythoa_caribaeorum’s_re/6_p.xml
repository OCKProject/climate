<p class="p">The difference in suitable areas between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres suggests asymmetrical species distribution, with the Northern Hemisphere containing larger suitable habitats. This may result from differences in the oceanographic conditions of both basins. In contrast to other oceans, the Atlantic Ocean presents a net flux of superficial water transport to the north, with the Labrador Current being much weaker than the Malvinas Current; therefore, its principal component is toward the north (
