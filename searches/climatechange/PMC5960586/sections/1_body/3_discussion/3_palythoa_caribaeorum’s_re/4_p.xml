 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> would lose potential habitats in both the northernmost and southernmost ranges of its distribution, without any gain in suitable areas due to a drastic decrease in salinity and pH values. Freshwater intrusions from the La Plata and Amazon rivers would influence the species’ habitat along the Brazilian shelf, restricting its distribution to northeastern Brazil. Similarly, the Mississippi River plume would decrease the adequacy for the species in the north. In general, when looking at changes in salinity, pH, and temperature for any climate scenario, the variations are more intense in the north and south via the intrusion of polar and temperate currents into the continental shelf. These differences alter the habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> and are more prominent in the Southern Hemisphere.
