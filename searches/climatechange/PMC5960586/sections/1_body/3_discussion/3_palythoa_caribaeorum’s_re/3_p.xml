<p class="p">The same trend observed under the RCP 2.6 scenario occurs in the RCP 4.5 scenario, with an increase in potential habitat in the northernmost range of its distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). However, for this scenario, 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> would also lose habitat in the south, including around Cape Frio. Other areas, such as the continental shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula, would gain suitable zones in the RCP 4.5 scenario, due to higher salinity values and lower temperature variations. For regions experiencing a loss of suitable areas, such as the northeastern Brazil and Amazonian regions, the drop in pH values, salinity, and an increase in the temperature range would be responsible.
