<p class="p">Although it was assumed in this work, it is not expected that all individuals will be affected in the same way by climate change. It is known that, at smaller scales, differences between symbiont algae (

 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Costa et al., 2011</xref>), can result in distinct outcomes for different populations under climate change. Average and maximum temperatures had small contributions to the model and were not considered here; however, it is known that surface waters are likely to experience an increase in temperature, especially in tropical areas (
