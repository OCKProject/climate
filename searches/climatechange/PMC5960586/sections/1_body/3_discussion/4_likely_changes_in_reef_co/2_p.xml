<p class="p">Regarding the colonization of new areas by 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic>, the temperate region of the northwestern Atlantic would see its suitable area increased under RCP 2.6 and 4.5, around Cape Hatteras and Chesapeake Bay. Zoanthids have the potential to disperse to great distances due to their long larval stage (
