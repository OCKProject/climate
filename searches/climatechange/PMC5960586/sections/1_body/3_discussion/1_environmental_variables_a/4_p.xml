<p class="p">Similar to calcite and chlorophyll-
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, pH has a strong coastal component related to salinity, especially around the Amazonian river mouth, where pH drops below 7, and in the Virginian and Carolinian regions, where values exceed 8.25â€”both regions are devoid of the anthozoan. Regarding pH alone, a habitat with a pH over 7.85 is considered suitable, but due to correlations with the other variables, the habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> is constrained to a pH between 8.05 and 8.25.
