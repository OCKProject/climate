<p class="p">When the projection of the habitat suitability of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), it becomes evident that salinity has a major influence on the distribution of this species. Salinity had a higher contribution to the model, sometimes reducing habitat suitability even when the values of other variables, like temperature and chlorophyll-
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, were adequate for the species. Freshwater discharges from rivers are also an important source of calcite for oceans; however, calcite is 100 times more soluble in seawater than in freshwater (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Libes, 2009</xref>), so high concentrations of this mineral are not limited to river-influenced regions. In fact, regarding only calcite, habitat suitability is positively correlated with its concentration, possibly because calcite concentration also indicates other important biogeochemical controls.
