<p class="p">Lastly, temperature range seems to influence the species in a typical latitudinal fashion, presenting higher values in the northernmost and southernmost regions of the study area due to the intrusion of colder waters onto the continental shelf at higher latitudes. Although

 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bouzon, Brandini &amp; Rocha, 2012</xref>), extreme variations in temperature and decreases in salinity caused by rain can cause mortality (
 <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sebens, 1977</xref>). For current environmental conditions, the latitudes 30°north and 30°south can be recognized as limits to the distribution of this organism, mainly due to the temperature range: between 9°C and 13°C in the south and 13°C and 24°C in the north. In these regions, salinity reaches a value of 34, with high seasonal variation (
