 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) classification, it is evident that all of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum’s</italic> current potential habitat is within warm marine provinces, characterizing the species’ distribution as tropical. However, the limits of its distribution are close to warm-temperate and cold provinces, which are characterized as marginal parts of the distribution. Studying reef communities located at higher latitudes can improve our knowledge of how this species will be affected during environmental and climatic changes (
 <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thomas et al., 2017</xref>); thus, examining 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum’s</italic> distribution in these regions is extremely important.
