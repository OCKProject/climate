<p class="p">There are regions characterized as potential habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> that have no record of the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">3</xref>). This indicates either a lack of adequate sampling effort in the Guianan, Greater Antilles, Bahamian, and western and southwestern Caribbean regions, the absence of proper substrata, or other conditions not considered in the present model.
