<p class="p">This study aimed to investigate and model the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean, generating potential distribution maps for the present and the year 2100 based on forecast climate models. The maps were used to characterize the species’ habitat and identify areas where suitability was retained, lost, or gained for 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> over time and under different climate scenarios.
