<p class="p">Species distribution models (SDM) are largely used in ecology, biogeography, and conservation biology to help solve practical problems in these fields (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Acosta et al., 2016</xref>). One of the main assumptions of SDM is that the environment is in equilibrium with its species, whose distribution is determined by environmental variability (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ara√∫jo &amp; Pearson, 2005</xref>), excluding biological interactions, dispersion barriers, and fast or small-scale environmental disturbances (

Temporal and climatic variations also interfere in the modeling, and environmental data must be gathered from the same period in which the species was recorded, making it difficult to acquire large amounts of data for mobile organisms. In this scenario,
