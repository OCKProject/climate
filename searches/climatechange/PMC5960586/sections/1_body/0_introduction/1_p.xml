 <italic class="italic">Palythoa caribaeorum</italic> (Duchassaing &amp; Michelotti, 1860) is a sessile colonial anthozoan common along the west coast of the Atlantic Ocean (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kemp et al., 2006</xref>). This species can be found from Florida in the US (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kemp et al., 2006</xref>) to Arvoredo Island in Brazil (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bouzon, Brandini &amp; Rocha, 2012</xref>), as well as around many oceanic islands in the Atlantic, such as Bermuda (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lesser et al., 1990</xref>) and the São Pedro e São Paulo archipelago (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Edwards &amp; Lubbock, 1983</xref>). Its distribution is not limited to the western side of the Atlantic Ocean, however, with records in the Cape Verde islands (
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reimer, Hirose &amp; Wirtz, 2010</xref>). This broad geographic distribution is possible because 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> has a great tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sebens, 1982</xref>). Although studies on 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> larvae are lacking, it is expected that its biology would be similar to its sister species, 
 <italic class="italic">Palythoa turbeculosa</italic> (Esper 1791), which has symbiotic larvae with planktonic habits and a larval stage up to 170 days long (
