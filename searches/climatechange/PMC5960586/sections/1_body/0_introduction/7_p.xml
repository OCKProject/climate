<p class="p">The accelerating rates of environmental change pose a challenge to most organisms living in shallow waters throughout the world’s oceans. At a global scale, between 1971 and 2010, the warming rate of the oceans’ surface waters reached 0.13°C per decade (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). Since 1950, coastal regions with high evaporation rates are becoming saltier; and for the same period, the pH of surface waters has decreased by 0.1 (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). The forecast for the year 2050 shows a redistribution of marine organisms as a function of the increase in temperature. This redistribution is expected to be toward mid-latitude zones, increasing species richness in these areas while decreasing richness in the tropics due to extinction, migration, and reduction in genetic diversity (
