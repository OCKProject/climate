 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Under the RCP 2.6 scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), the southern range of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> distribution would lose suitability, as would the Caribbean, Bermudan, and Floridian regions; however, the total suitable area is close to the one observed for the present: 492,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. An increase in suitable areas in the Guianan, Amazonian, Bahamian, and Caribbean regions was also observed, but the biggest change occurred in the northern part of its distribution, in the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the Carolinian and Virginian regions. In these areas, the potential distribution of the species reached almost as far north as Chesapeake Bay. The southernmost area capable of retaining suitability for the species was near Cape Frio, in southeastern Brazil.
