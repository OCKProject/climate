<p class="p">To demonstrate the most important regions for the species, a map of the intersection of all suitable areas under any climate scenarios for the year 2100 was made (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows that the northern part of the map (from 0°northward) would have much more significance for the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> than the southern part. The suitable areas comprise six ecoregions in the north (southern, southwestern, and western Caribbean, southern Gulf of Mexico, and Bahamian and Greater Antilles regions) against only two in the south (northeastern and eastern Brazil).
