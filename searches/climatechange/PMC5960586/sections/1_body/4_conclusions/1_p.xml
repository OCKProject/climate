<p class="p">The present habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic> can be characterized by high salinity values, marine pH, and a small to moderate range of temperature in coastal and shallow environments. The species’ current distribution in the western Atlantic Ocean is restricted to warm provinces, identifying it as a coastal and warm-water species, together with shallow water corals. According to this study, this organism’s potential distribution is likely to change by the year 2100. It is possible that, under low to mild anthropogenic impacts (RCP 2.6 and 4.5), the species’ distribution will be extended northward and will face a decrease of suitable habitat in the southernmost range of its distribution under any climate scenario. Under the scenario with the highest anthropogenic impacts (RCP 8.5), novel suitable areas poleward were not predicted, and only one-half of its potential habitat area would be retained when compared to the present. Under any climate scenario, the Caribbean Sea remained suitable for the species, characterizing this region as a possible refuge. Upwelling regions, such as Cape Frio and northern Colombia, could provide a refuge for this species as well, diminishing the local impacts of climate changes. Although community changes were discussed according to the available literature, biological and oceanographic processes not considered in this study may play an important role in the outcome of these changes.
