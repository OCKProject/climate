 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Collins et al., 2011</xref>) retrieved from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used on the projections for the year 2100 under three different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios: low, middle, and high radiative forcing of 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 W/m

The RCPs are related to retention of energy by the Earth’s surface due to accumulation of greenhouse gases from human activities, therefore higher numbers represent a greater anthropogenic impact on our biosphere. The HadGEM2-ES climate model was freely available and provided outputs of the main interest variables and high resolution in tropical areas under the RCP climate scenarios. When there were no available data for the projections, the layers were kept unchanged. NetCDF files from the climate model were interpolated using the bilinear interpolation “interp2” of Matlab 7.14, and were then cropped and converted to ASC format.
