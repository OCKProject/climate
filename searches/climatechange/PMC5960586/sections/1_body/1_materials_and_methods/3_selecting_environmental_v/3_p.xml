<p class="p">All the features available in Maxent were used during the modeling (standard set up). To choose the environmental variables and the regulation multiplier (

 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">R Core Team, 2015</xref>) was used, with a contribution threshold of 4% and Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.9. A series of runs were conducted, varying the 
 <italic class="italic">Rm</italic> from 0.5 to 10 with increments of 0.5, and were then assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The environmental variables and 
 <italic class="italic">Rm</italic> of the model with a lower AIC were used to run the final Maxent model. The AIC tends to choose models that sort the most important variables, as well as models that better estimate environmental suitability (
 <xref rid="ref-95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren et al., 2014</xref>), and therefore behave better when projected onto novel climate scenarios than models chosen using the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC) value (
 <xref rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren &amp; Seifert, 2011</xref>). The AIC selects the optimal and most parsimonious model, taking into account its complexity (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bozdogan, 1987</xref>). Thirty percent of the data were randomly sampled to test the model along each of the 100 replicates, resulting in an average for all replicates. In all the analyses, 10,000 random points were used as the background along the whole study area.
