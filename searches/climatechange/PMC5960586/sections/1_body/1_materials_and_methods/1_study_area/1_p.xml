 <italic class="italic">P. caribaeorum</italic>. The oceanographic features of this region are influenced by the South Equatorial Current, from the east, which is divided into two components: northward (North Brazil Current) and southward along the coast (Brazil Current). The North Brazil Current flows toward the northwest, passing by the Caribbean Sea, Yucatan Channel, and Gulf of Mexico before merging with the Antilles Current in the Florida Strait to form the Gulf Stream, which flows toward Europe. Due to the strong tropical component, the region between 20°S and 30°N is strongly influenced by waters heated in equatorial regions (
