<p class="p">Occurrence points found on land or at depths deeper than 100 m were automatically excluded, as were those localized in freshwater environments. Because sampled areas and methodologies varied among study sites, only one occurrence per pixel (5 arcminutes), based on the environmental variables dataset, was kept for analysis (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith &amp; Leathwick, 2009</xref>). This point was placed in the middle of each pixel, disregarding the exact occurrence point. After that, to avoid bias originating from densely sampled sites, the geographic filter “OccurrenceThinner” version 1.04 (
