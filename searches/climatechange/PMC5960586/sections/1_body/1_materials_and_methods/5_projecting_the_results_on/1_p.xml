<p class="p">Maps were generated using the cumulative likelihood of species occurrence obtained from Maxent, which can be interpreted as the sum of the relative occurrence rate of the species in one pixel and other pixels with the same or lower values of the relative occurrence rate (ROR). This type of output is best for drawing species distribution boundaries for different climate scenarios (
