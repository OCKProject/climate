Examples include in-depth case studies or quantitative surveys that can be used to develop context-specific guidelines and strategy recommendations for municipal decision-makers and officials. In addition, further applications to empirical data could provide useful insights for answering questions and identifying patterns regarding the pre-conditions and main requirements for generating and implementing synergetic measures, the best organizational design for particular settings, and limitations on the joint institutionalization of mitigation and adaptation.</p>
