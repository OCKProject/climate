Higher-level governmental institutions can support the integration of adaptigation into standard operating procedures and enhance standardization, by clearly regulating how mitigation and adaptation can be implemented jointly. Furthermore, municipal policy is often oriented by national or global goals and visions; therefore, higher-level institutions are encouraged to explicitly promote the joint integration of mitigation and adaptation. Finally, funding should be provided at national and supranational levels (e.g., the European Union) to support the creation of adaptigative structures, such as adaptigation managers or design studies.
