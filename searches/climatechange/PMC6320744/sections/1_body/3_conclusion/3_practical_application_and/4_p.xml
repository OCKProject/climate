<p id="Par84" class="p">Although the framework is not designed to provide detailed, operational guidelines that specify context-specific actions, national and local decision-makers as well as officials can use it when considering how to improve the joint institutionalization of mitigation and adaptation strategies in city administrations. It is a robust starting point for obtaining an overview of the factors that should be considered when institutionalizing adaptigative structures. Even if it does not dictate, for instance, context-specific elements such as the horizontal implementation of administrative units (either as specific climate departments, or integrated into planning departments), it helps to focus on the key aspects that enhance the implementation of effective organizational structures and procedures. It highlights, for instance, that unclear or ill-defined goals should be made clear and acceptable (for instance, by developing an overall vision and specifying agreed goals); vague, temporary jobs should be turned into permanent positions with clear roles and responsibilities (e.g., the creation of a Climate Protection Officer position); and unclear technology should be transformed into standard operating procedures (e.g., by listing measures that fall under the scope of the climate mitigation/adaptation plan, or by integrating climate-related issues into formal planning procedures).</p>
