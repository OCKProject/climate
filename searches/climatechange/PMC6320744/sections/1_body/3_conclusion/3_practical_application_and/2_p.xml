<p id="Par79" class="p">The creation and execution of climate responses is likely to be more effective if mitigation and adaptation are jointly institutionalized in the organizational and political structures of city administrations. This means that decision-makers and politicians at all levels (from local to global) should not only consider potential interrelations and synergies between mitigation and adaptation measures, but also make the organizational setting more effective by thinking about the joint implementation of the two issues within the administration. In this context, our findings show that political and intra-organizational commitment to, and support for climate mitigation and adaptation are crucial for institutionalization. Given the very different paths that mitigation and adaptation processes have, as yet, taken in city administrations, it is clearly important to raise related awareness at both the administrative and political levels. Accordingly, the study resulted in three main strategy recommendations, addressing the identified key processes of joint institutionalization presented in Fig.

    <italic class="italic">Integration into standard operating procedures.</italic> The ability of a city to fulfill its different tasks requires defined procedures, roles, and rules in specified situations. The importance of these factors, together with legitimate power (such as mandatory legal and internal directives), increases when there is a high level of uncertainty, for instance, with respect to technology (no clear directives and many interpretations of how to carry out tasks, etc.). In this case, the power of (certain) departments increases, and the power of political leaders decreases (cf. Scott 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>). In this context, the integration of adaptigation into the standard operating procedures of urban planning processes and associated action programs across different departments seem to be key for successful climate policy outcomes. Some important preconditions for this integration are (1) the definition of clear and binding organizational responsibilities and workflows, (2) co-production structures such as internal cross-sectoral working groups and/or roundtables, (3) interorganizational networks, such as climate committees for exchanging knowledge and fostering commitment, and (4) dedicated and well-trained personnel who hold a permanent position (possibly with defined adaptigation tasks) in the organization.

    <italic class="italic">Locally specific goals and visions.</italic> Generating a deep commitment to adaptigation within the administration, and from relevant external stakeholders is crucial and seems to depend, among other things, upon the ability to formulate joint local goals and develop a vision with active participation from those concerned (a bottom-up process). Establishing clear structures that allow for such knowledge co-production seems to be crucial for internalizing adaptigation within the administration. In addition, it can foster political consistency and reliability.

    <italic class="italic">Dedicated officials.</italic> The findings also suggest that officials at all hierarchical levels too often do not consider climatic issues because of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding potential actions. This issue could be addressed by supporting dedicated staff who have the task of coordinating and promoting inter-departmental actions and information-sharing structures for adaptigation. Related organizational responsibilities and job specifications need to be clearly defined—either by creating a specific administrative unit, or by officially integrating the issues of mitigation and adaptation into existing, subject-related units and associated mandates. Within these units, the creation of permanent positions with clear and defined roles and responsibilities for adaptigation also seems to be crucial for successful institutionalization and long-term commitment (as opposed to temporary, partial engagement). Capacity building could reduce the need for additional staff/resources and reduce dependence on external experts (a form of human stockpiling).
