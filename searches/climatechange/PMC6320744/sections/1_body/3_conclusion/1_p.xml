 <italic class="italic">Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework</italic> is a heuristic, analytic model, developed both for assessing and supporting the joint institutionalization of mitigation and adaptation in municipal administrations, especially medium-sized cities. The framework can also be used by the leaders, decision-makers, and officials of megacities as a heuristic instrument to initiate discussions about how the institutionalization of climate policies is structured in their administrations. The operationalization of the concept of adaptigation provides an urgently needed, innovative approach for science, policy, and in practice.
