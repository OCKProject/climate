<p id="Par7" class="p">We used a three-step approach to construct the 
 <italic class="italic">Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework</italic> (Kelle and Kluge 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kuckartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2014</xref>). First, some broad theoretical concepts were used as a heuristic to deduce a basic analytic coding scheme that formed the basis for a more detailed search of the literature (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.1.1</xref>). Second, the assessment of current empirical and theoretical concepts and models on climate change provided further input (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.1.2</xref> and Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Third, empirical data from existing studies and guidelines and our own field research helped to refine and revise the framework (Sections 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.3</xref>). The following sections (Sections 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.2</xref>) describe these steps in more detail.
