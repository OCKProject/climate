For instance, the German KoBe project (Empowerment of Municipalities at the Local Level to Adapt to Climate Change), conducted by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment, and Energy highlights the opportunity to develop a joint vision; examples include the “development of resilient energy infrastructures, emission-free, and climate-sensitive city” or the “energy efficient management of adaptation” (Schüle et al.
