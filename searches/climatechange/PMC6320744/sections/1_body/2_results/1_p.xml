<p id="Par13" class="p">This section presents the 
 <italic class="italic">Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework</italic>, which is an instrument designed to assess and support the joint institutionalization of climate mitigation and adaptation. The initial, basic framework linked the institutionalization assessment criteria to four main organizational features (organizational structure, goals and visions, actors, and technology/tools) (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.1</xref>). Second, the examination of the empirical literature resulted in the operationalization of these features (Sections 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.3</xref>). Third, the applicability and the practical fit of the developed variables were tested in two case studies (Section 
 <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.4</xref>). The resulting framework is presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, and its different features/variables are described in the following sections. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> presents a summary and brief explanation of the variables and their respective attributes.
