<p id="Par14" class="p">The framework is based on four features of bureaucracies, which are generally used to systematically assess institutionalization processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>): organizational structure, visions and goals, actors, and technology. They describe that municipal administrations act within a framework structured by rules (organizational structure); they follow institutionalized patterns (visions and goals), where rules are matched with roles (actors). They implement standard operating procedures and routines (technology) consistent with the logic of appropriateness and the organizational process model (Allison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1969</xref>; March 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1999</xref>; Scott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>), rather than choosing a single best solution in every case. These four features were deduced from 
 <italic class="italic">Leavitt’s diamond</italic> (Leavitt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">1965</xref>; Scott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>) and from general considerations regarding the systemic organization of administrations (Czada

    <italic class="italic">Organizational structure</italic>: This feature refers to the implementation of policies such as mitigation and adaptation within the formal structure (organizational units). It represents the “patterned or regularized aspects of the relationships existing among participants in an organization” (Scott 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>) that are used to implement the organization’s visions and goals. The reliability, stability, and effectiveness of a city administration are enhanced by persistent, formal, rule-based structures comprising defined roles, positions (mostly independent of specific individuals), routines, and hierarchies (Paulic 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2014</xref>). Assuming a prevailing logic of appropriateness, it is vitally important to examine rules and structures to understand institutionalization processes, given that the institutional setting provides the frame for action (March 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1999</xref>).

    <italic class="italic">Visions and goals</italic>: This feature comprises normative institutions and the value-driven implementation of policies through setting goals and creating a vision. The development of a qualitative vision is a vital element in institutionalizing climate-related issues (Gukenbiehl 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2002</xref>). It is often influenced by the overall aims of institutions and organizations in a multi-level governance system (Thoenig 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2011</xref>). This vision, which is likely to result in operationalized goals, could also be seen as a resource that policymakers can use in negotiations with other departments and stakeholders to enforce their preferences and implement concrete measures. Goals are defined as “conceptions of desired ends - ends that participants attempt to achieve through their performance of task activities” (Scott 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>). They become part of the administration’s organizational culture (Martin and Meyerson 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">1988</xref>). Following March (
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1999</xref>), appropriate and ambitious goals and visions are important to ensure that the organization performs well.

    <italic class="italic">Actors</italic>: This refers to the individual or collective actors making up the administrative body, who work to achieve its goals. The existence of specific, committed actors, and their role and power within the organization are seen as crucial factors for institutionalization processes (Scott 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>).

    <italic class="italic">Technology</italic>: This represents mechanisms “for transforming inputs into outputs” (Scott 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2003</xref>) and includes procedures and tools designed to accomplish legally-required, or self-imposed tasks. The 
    <italic class="italic">Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework</italic> incorporates decision-making and processing by the application of rules, and matching problems with standard operating procedures. Hence, technology is closely associated with defined procedures, roles, and rules that are applied in specific situations.
