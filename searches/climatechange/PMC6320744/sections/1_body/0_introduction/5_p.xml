<p id="Par6" class="p">Against this background, the objective of this research was to create a consistent heuristic framework, based on robust theory and empirically specified variables, to assess and support the joint institutionalization of adaptation and mitigation—here called 
 <italic class="italic">adaptigation</italic>—in city administrations. We call this the 
 <italic class="italic">Adaptigation Institutionalization Framework</italic>. It was developed based on an in-depth literature review and interviews with experts. In addition, for our pilot application, we tested the framework on the administrations of the cities of Würzburg (Germany) and Mwanza (Tanzania). Since there is a general consensus in the literature that cities with 50,000 to 1 million inhabitants (so called medium-sized, secondary, intermediate, or intermediary cities) should be given greater attention in the current climate change mitigation and adaptation discourse (UN-Habitat
