<p id="Par3" class="p">For many years, or even decades, municipalities have been engaged in “mitigation” or “adaptation” activities. In Germany, for example, municipalities have implemented energy-saving measures to improve cost effectiveness, while urban development and planning authorities have sought to protect the urban microclimate through legally binding restrictions on new planning applications (Fickert and Fieseler

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, strategic approaches with a normative vision, concrete goals, and clear measures that are based on mitigation or adaptation concepts are the exceptions (Wamsler et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2014</xref>). The integration of climate adaptation concepts into municipal policy and administrative structures is even newer, but has increased in both scientific and municipal practice in recent years (Anguelovski and Carmin
