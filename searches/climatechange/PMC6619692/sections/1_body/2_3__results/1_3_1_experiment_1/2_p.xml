<p class="p">When vulnerability is examined as an aggregate function of demographic and socioeconomic inputs only, Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados are identified as the most vulnerable with Cuba as the least vulnerable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>). When intense rain events are factored in, Jamaica retains its rank as the most vulnerable, but is followed by Belize and Guyana, while Antigua and Barbuda emerge as the least vulnerable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B</xref>). In fact, all locations, with the exceptions of Jamaica (1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>) and Bahamas (10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>) have a shift in their suggested comparative vulnerability. Locations whose vulnerabilities increase when heavy rains are considered are Belize (4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup>), Dominican Republic (6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>), St. Vincent (8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>), Trinidad (11
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>) and Cuba (12
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> to 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>). The initial suggestion is that the inclusion of a sub-index which captures intra-regional climate variability, (as represented by intense rains in this case), changes the comparative vulnerability of Caribbean countries to climate in comparison to rankings based on demographic and socioeconomic conditions alone.
