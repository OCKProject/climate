<p class="p">It is not an easy task to select all papers (to avoid confusion with the document type “article,” the term “paper” rather than “article” is used throughout this manuscript for any kind of journal-based publication) related to a specific research field or research topic using literature databases as information source. Completeness or recall (
 <italic class="italic">all</italic> relevant papers) and high precision (
 <italic class="italic">only</italic> relevant papers) are inversely related and mutually exclusive [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This basic connection between completeness and precision precludes a much “cleaner” publication set (i.e. more hits and concurrently less non-relevant papers). In particular, a broad research field like climate change research is not clearly defined and there is no sufficient categorization by keywords, index terms or thesauri. Since the beginning of climate change research, a lot of (neighboring) disciplines tend to relate their research topics on climate research but their papers often deal primarily with other topics.
