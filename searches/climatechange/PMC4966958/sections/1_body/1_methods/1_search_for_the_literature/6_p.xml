<p class="p">Step 2: We searched the more complex search terms derived from step 1 listed above and in addition the short term “*climat*” each within the titles only. The left truncation in addition to the right truncation of the term “climat” was used to include also terms such as “pal(a)eoclimate”. We found only one single term covered by this left and right truncation which is not closely related to climate change research: “acclimation” or “acclimatization”, respectively. Papers with “*acclimat*” in the title were removed unless they contain the term “climat*” (with right truncation but without left truncation) in the title.</p>
