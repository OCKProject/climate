<p class="p">Step 3: We searched the more complex terms from step 1 within the abstracts only. Although searching in abstracts only is not possible in the WoS, it is possible in our in-house database derived from the WoS data. Abstract searching based on short terms like “climat*” results in too many papers which are not closely related to climate change research. Note that abstracts are generally included in WoS since 1991 for the SCI-E and 1992 for the SSCI only. A few papers have been indexed with abstracts prior to 1991 in WoS.</p>
