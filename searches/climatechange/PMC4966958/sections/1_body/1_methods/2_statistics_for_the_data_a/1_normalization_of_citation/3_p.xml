<p class="p">The indicator PP
 <sub class="sub">top 50%</sub> is the proportion of papers in A which belongs to the 50% most frequently cited papers. Thus, this is the proportion of papers which is cited equal to or more frequently than “an average paper” in the corresponding reference sets. PP
 <sub class="sub">top 50%</sub> is the basic citation impact indicator in bibliometrics which indicates above average perceptions of literature with PP
 <sub class="sub">top 50%</sub>&gt;50 and below average perceptions with PP
 <sub class="sub">top 50%</sub>&lt;50 (50 is the expected value indicating an average impact). Besides PP
 <sub class="sub">top 50%</sub>, two further indicators are frequently used in bibliometric studies (e.g. in the Leiden Ranking), which focus on the excellence level: PP
 <sub class="sub">top 10%</sub> and PP
 <sub class="sub">top 1%</sub>, respectively, specifies the papers which belong to the 10% and 1%, respectively, most frequently cited papers. The expected values for an average paper set are 10 for PP
 <sub class="sub">top 10%</sub> and 1 for PP
 <sub class="sub">top 1%</sub>. These indicators show, e.g., whether a given country B was able to publish more papers in the excellence area than a given country C. With more papers in this area, country B would have contributed more important papers to the climate change research than country C.
