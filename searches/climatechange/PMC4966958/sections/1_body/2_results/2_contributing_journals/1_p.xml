<p class="p">In accordance with the publication practice in the core natural sciences, we assume that research results from climate change research are mainly published as journal (or conference) articles which are predominantly covered by literature databases like WoS. Thus, the number of papers published in a specific journal can be seen as a measure of the importance or “weight” of that journal for a specific research topic or field. In so far, it is interesting to find out, which journals are dominating quantitatively as publication medium for researchers active in the field of climate change research. 
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the distribution of the climate change research papers included in our data set throughout the journals which have published at least 1000 papers. Again, the bibliometric indicators PP
