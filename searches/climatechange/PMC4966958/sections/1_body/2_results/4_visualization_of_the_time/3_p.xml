<p class="p">If we analyze and compare the maps based on the three selected time spans (c.f. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160393.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>) we find some remarkable changes: The title word map of the first decade (1980â€“1990, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160393.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>) shows the term 
 <italic class="italic">climate</italic> as the most pronounced title word. The terms 
 <italic class="italic">effect</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">influence</italic> appear secondarily. The term 
 <italic class="italic">climatic change</italic> and the related terms appear third-rated (i.e. as small circles). The title word map constructed from papers published in the year 2003 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160393.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>) for the first time accentuates the term 
 <italic class="italic">change</italic>. The 2014 map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160393.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>) is quite similar to the map of the overall publication set (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160393.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) with 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">effect</italic> as the most pronounced terms. The reader might miss the term 
 <italic class="italic">impact</italic>, but it is hidden behind 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic>.
