<p class="p">The changing title words based on the maps of the three specific publication times exhibit that the term 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> comes forward with time. Obviously, the authors increasingly use a term which implies global warming (and therewith anthropogenic causes) as a matter of fact. Furthermore, the term 
 <italic class="italic">impact</italic> arises and points to research dealing with the various effects and risks of climate changeâ€“see also the IPCC Synthesis Report 2014, Summary for Policymakers [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The term 
 <italic class="italic">model</italic> and related terms (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">simulation</italic>) appear independently of time. This indicates the high relevance of climate modeling since the beginning of the time period analyzed here.
