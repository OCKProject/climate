 <xref rid="pone.0160393.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, together with the percentage of excellent papers (i.e. PP

 <sub class="sub">TopX%</sub> values in columns 2 are relative to the countries’ overall impact of all papers between 1980 and 2012. A value of 200 for example corresponds to twice the impact of the countries’ climate change papers compared to all the countries’ papers in the aforementioned time frame.
