<p class="p">According to 
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. China appears on rank five, followed by France and Australia. PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 50%</sub> of these seven countries (with more than 10,000 papers in total) extends between 56.98% (China) and 74.59% (UK). PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 1%</sub> ranges from 1.6% (China) to 4.13% (UK). PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 10%</sub> ranges from 14.58% (China) to 26.13% (UK). Hence, the three citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced papers in climate change research with the largest reception compared to the other countries (with more than 10,000 papers). However, the other top countries rank nearby (with the exception of China, which nevertheless ranks above average). Switzerland, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top with regard to all three bibliometric indicators–the impact of their contributions to climate change research is impressive. The citation impact of the climate change papers of all countries is above or far above the overall impact of the countries’ papers each.
