<p class="p">The literature growth is roughly in accordance with the results of Grieneisen and Zhang [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], who report that the number of publications on climate change and global warming has doubled with a rate of approximately every 4 years. As mentioned above, Stanhill [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] found a doubling rate of 11 years for the time period 1951â€“1997. To put this into perspective, we compare our results with the growth rate of the overall science: According to Bornmann and Mutz [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] the total volume of publications covered by the WoS between 1980 and 2012 doubled approximately every 24 years. Hence, the growth rate of climate change related publications is extraordinarily high. The bend down around 2012 is presumably caused by still incomplete coverage of the recent publication years through WoS and is no sign of decline.
