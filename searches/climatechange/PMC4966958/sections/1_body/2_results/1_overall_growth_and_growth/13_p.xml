<p class="p">According to 
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, all subfields together comprise more than 81% of the total climate change papers published within the time period 1980â€“2012 (note that we have restricted all citation impact analyses to 2012 as the most recent publication year). The PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 50%</sub> values of all subfields are above the proportion of the total climate change literature (PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 50%</sub> = 63.43%). Research on vulnerability (PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 1%</sub> = 3.51) and on adaptation (PP
 <sub class="sub">Top 1%</sub> = 3.47) can be seen as the subfields within climate change research publishing the largest proportion of very important papers.
