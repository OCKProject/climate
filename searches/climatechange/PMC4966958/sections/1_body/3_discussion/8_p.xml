<p class="p">This study is a first attempt to a mapping of the complete climate change literature. However, more bibliometric research is needed to analyze and overview the research field from a quantitative perspective. Future research should focus on in-depth analyses of more specific topics like the impact of global warming on agriculture, fishery, forestry, and viniculture (winegrowing). Such studies can contribute to an understanding of the evolution, structure, and knowledge base of climate change research.</p>
