<p class="p">Like most bibliometric analyses this study has some limitations to be mentioned here: (1) The completeness of our data set is limited by the fact that abstracts are not searchable in WoS prior to 1991. (2) Title words are sometimes multi-meaning and not sufficiently specific for detailed interpretations. Therefore, one should avoid over-interpretation of title word analyses via VOSviewer.</p>
