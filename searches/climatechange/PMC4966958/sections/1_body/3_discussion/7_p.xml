<p class="p">The title word analysis shows that the term 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> comes forward with time. Obviously, the authors increasingly use a term which implies global warming (and therewith anthropogenic causes) as a matter of fact. Furthermore, the term 
 <italic class="italic">impact</italic> arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term 
 <italic class="italic">model</italic> and related terms (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">simulation</italic>) appear independently of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling also revealed by the subfield analysis.
