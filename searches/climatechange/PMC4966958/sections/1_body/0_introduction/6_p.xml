<p class="p">Other bibliometric studies deal with more specific topics within the field of climate research: Ji et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] analyzed research on Antarctica, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] discussed the vulnerability of climate change, and Pasgaard and Strange [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] presented a quantitative analysis of around 15,000 scientific publications from the time period 1999–2010, discussing the distribution of climate change research throughout the contributing countries and the potential causes of this distribution. Vasileiadou [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] have explored the impact of the IPCC Assessment Reports on science. Bjurström and Polk [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] analyzed the interdisciplinarity of climate change research based on the referenced journals in the IPCC Third Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] via co-citation analysis. Hellsten and Leydesdorff [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] analyzed the development of the knowledge base and programmatic focus of the journal 
 <italic class="italic">Climatic Change</italic>. Most interesting and in contrast to substantial public doubt are the findings of Anderegg et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. They conclusively revealed the striking agreement among climate research scientists on the anthropogenic cause of climate change based on the publications of 1,372 top climate experts. Janko et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] analyzed the controversies about climate change through comparison of references in and citations of contrarian reports.
