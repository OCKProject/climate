<p class="p">Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns during an extended period of time (from decades to millions of years). Meanwhile, 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">global warming</italic> are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earth's surface. From the perspective of large time periods, climate change is caused by a multitude of factors like variations in solar radiation (changing parameters of the earth’s orbit, variations of the solar activity observed via sunspot number), drifting continents (see plate tectonics), volcanic eruptions (producing large amounts of sulfate-based aerosols), and possibly others. During the last decades, human activities (in particular burning of fossil fuel and pollution as the main consequences of the growth of population and industrialization) have been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">global warming</italic>. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports in its foreword that “the IPCC is now 95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming [
