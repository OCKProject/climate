<p class="p">Most of the studies in the past focused on specific topics within climate change research and do not present an analysis of the complete research field. The few comprehensive studies mentioned above used search queries for the literature search which are more or less inappropriate: They are mostly based on queries for literature retrieval, using somewhat arbitrary items for selecting subfields. The corresponding publication sets are therefore limited with regard to completeness: Stanhill [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] has analyzed the growth of climate change relevant literature using exclusively the abstract journal of the 
 <italic class="italic">American Meteorological Society</italic> as publication set. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] analyzed trends in research on global climate change: “‘Climate change’, ‘climate changes’, ‘climatic change’, and ‘climatic changes’ were used as the keyword to search titles, abstracts, and keywords from 1992 to 2009” (p. 14). Pasgaard and Strange [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] used “the search phrases climat* AND change* and global warming (with asterisk wildcards)” (p. 1685). Only Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0160393.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] applied a more sophisticated method (see below) but his analysis deals exclusively with the climate change vulnerability.
