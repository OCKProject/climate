<p class="p">In this study, we demonstrate that a climate change-induced range expansion into a novel habitat overrules the Bergmann’s cline demonstrated by the species within its native habitat, potentially due to differences in predation pressure or environmental conditions in the native and novel habitats. The deterioration of this biogeographic body size pattern has a number of implications for fecundity and offspring quality in novel habitats at the edge of the species’ range. As climate change advances, spatial mismatches between species distributions will continue to reshuffle biological communities, leading to novel communities and unique plant-animal interactions [
