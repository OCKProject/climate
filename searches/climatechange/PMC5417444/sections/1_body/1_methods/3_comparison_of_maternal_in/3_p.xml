<p class="p">Other than the non-eyed eggs sampled for egg size determination, the remainder of each female’s brood (whether non-eyed or eyed eggs), was allowed to remain on the pleopods and continue normal development. Crabs were monitored twice daily for larval hatching. Twelve newly hatched larvae from each brood (mangrove n = 21 and mixed marsh n = 18 as described previously) were randomly selected and pipetted into individual Kimble borosilicate glass culture tubes (15 mm x 85 mm) with ~80 mL of 0.2 μm filtered seawater. Water was partially changed and larval mortality was monitored daily to determine starvation resistance (days) as a proxy for maternal energy provisioning. The impact of habitat on larval starvation resistance was determined using a mixed effects Cox model, with unique maternal identity included as a random effect, thus preventing pseudoreplication by accounting for the twelve larvae collected from each individual female while simultaneously focusing on the importance of maternal habitat on larval starvation resistance.</p>
