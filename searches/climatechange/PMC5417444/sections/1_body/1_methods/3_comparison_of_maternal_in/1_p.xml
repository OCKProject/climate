<p class="p">In order to determine offspring quality, we collected ovigerous females independent of the stage of their brood’s embryonic development from the representative mangrove (n = 21) and mixed marsh (n = 18) sites described in the previous section and transported them live to the Smithsonian Marine Station in Fort Pierce, FL. Crabs were maintained at ambient temperature with a natural light: dark cycle in individual plastic aquaria (22.8 cm L x 15.2 cm W x 16.5 cm H) containing approximately 200–300 mL of filtered seawater (salinity ~31 ppt) and a piece of plastic mesh (20 cm x 4.5 cm) that provided a substrate on which crabs could exit the water. Crabs were fed plant material (

 <italic class="italic">alterniflora</italic> is a potential food source for the species. Moreover, all crabs included in the offspring quality experiment were gravid upon collection from the field, so the diet crabs were fed in captivity did not influence reproductive investment or offspring quality in the brood examined.
