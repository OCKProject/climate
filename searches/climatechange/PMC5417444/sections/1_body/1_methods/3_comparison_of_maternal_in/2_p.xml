<p class="p">A small portion (&lt;1/3) of each female’s egg mass was gently removed from the pleopods with forceps within 24 hours of collection from the field, placed into filtered sea water (~31 ppt), and visually examined under a Leica M205C dissecting microscope at 80X to determine egg developmental stage. Eggs were categorized as non-eyed (mangrove n = 10, marsh n = 15) or eyed (mangrove n = 11, marsh n = 3) based on visual inspection of each female’s brood. For females carrying recently extruded, non-eyed eggs, which are reflective of initial maternal investment in the quantity of egg yolk, a subsample of the removed eggs (n = 20–30) was photographed using a Jenoptik ProgRes C14+ camera attached to the Leica M205C dissecting microscope and ProgRes CapturePro v2.8.0 software. Egg size was then determined by randomly selecting 10 eggs from the photographed egg mass and measuring the circular area of each egg with imageJ software. Capitalizing on the spherical nature of
