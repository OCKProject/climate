<p class="p">In order to determine egg weight and fecundity, additional ovigerous females (n = 22 per site) were collected from the same two representative sites and placed immediately upon ice. Eggs were removed from the pleopods of each female, egg stage (eyed/noneyed) was determined, and crabs with recently extruded, non-eyed eggs were dissected to ensure that they were post-vitellogenic (i.e. all eggs were extruded). A subset of eggs was taken from 15 randomly selected crabs from each habitat type and counted under a dissecting microscope. These subsets were dried at 65Â°C for 48 hours and weighed. We determined the relationship between egg count and dry egg mass using a linear regression; the slope of this relationship indicates the average dry mass of a single egg [

We then measured the total brood dry weight of the ovigerous individuals collected from both habitats and used the total brood dry weight and the average dry mass of a single egg to calculate the total fecundity of individuals of varying sizes collected from both habitats (n = 22 per site). The impact of habitat on individual egg weight was analyzed with a general linear model with dry mass of the subset of eggs as the response variable and egg count and habitat as explanatory variables. Fecundity was analyzed using a general linear model with maternal body size (CW) and habitat as explanatory variables.
