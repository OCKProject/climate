<p class="p">In order to determine the influence of latitude and habitat type on (1) size at maturity and (2) average size of ovigerous females, we used separate general linear models for each response variable. Latitude and habitat type were included as explanatory variables. The interaction term between these variables was initially considered, but it was not significant for the model of size at maturity (P = 0.844) or the model of average size of ovigerous females (P = 0.331). Therefore, the interaction was removed to simplify both models.</p>
