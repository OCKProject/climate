<p class="p">Of the 12 sites surveyed, eight were pure mangrove habitats, three were hybrid mangrove-salt marsh habitats (hereafter referred to as mixed marsh), and one was a pure salt marsh habitat. The number of mixed and pure salt marsh sites surveyed was constrained by the extent of hybrid marsh sites and the limited distribution of

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], these dwarf trees are younger and smaller than those found further south in mature mangrove forests. As a result, the mangrove trees in mixed marshes are highly connected to the surrounding salt marsh, and their small size and isolated nature likely do not lend themselves to the same microhabitat creation that has been documented in mature mangrove forests (e.g. [
