<p class="p">At each site, crabs (mean sample size ± SE = 112.36 ± 6.93 at each site) were randomly collected during daytime high tides, at which time they are the most active foraging above the intertidal zone [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In the mangroves, crabs were collected by hand from the lower canopy and prop roots above the water line. In the salt marsh, crabs were collected by hand from exposed cordgrass. We measured their carapace width (CW) to the nearest tenth of a millimeter, identified their sex, and determined the reproductive status (gravid or not gravid) of females. We considered size at maturity to be the smallest gravid female collected at each site, consistent with previous methods of determining size at maturity in the species [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In order to expand our latitudinal coverage of size at maturity data, we also included published reports of size at maturity from two additional sites in mangrove habitats [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which both used the same method for determining size at maturity. We subsequently included size at maturity values from these literature sources in the same statistical analysis as the values established by our surveys. Thus, we maintained methodological consistency by considering size at maturity to be the smallest gravid female collected at each site, rather than employing alternative methods for determining size at maturity (e.g. [
