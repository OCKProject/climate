<p class="p">We conducted laboratory trials in which individuals (n = 12, mean ± SE = 22.6 ± 0.4 mm CW) were placed in 5-gallon buckets containing sediment to a height of 50 mm with a single dead stalk of

 <italic class="italic">alterniflora</italic> (mean ± SE = 1.0 ± 0.4 mm basal stem diameter) placed upright in the center of the bucket to simulate the habitat structure available in marsh habitats. Seawater was then added up to a height of 100 mm to simulate a high tide event, and individuals were placed in the bucket. Crabs in the salt marsh commonly climb both live and dead

 <italic class="italic">alterniflora</italic> stalks, which provide similar support to crabs. Dead stalks were used in this microcosm experiment to avoid any potential wilting.
