<p class="p">Next, we studied size-specific predation potential in both mangrove and mixed marsh habitats. Because individuals (CW&gt;15 mm) are not present in mixed marshes, small individuals (8–15 mm CW) were collected from the representative mixed marsh site and large individuals (18–25 mm CW) were collected from the representative mangrove site for tethering at both habitats. We brought

 <italic class="italic">pisonii</italic> from both size classes into the laboratory and affixed monofilament tethers (45 cm of 10 lb test) by tying a loop in the monofilament and attaching this loop to the back of the carapace using cyanoacrylate glue. Crabs were maintained in individual aquaria overnight and observed the following morning to ensure that tethers remained secure. Crabs were then transported to the field at low tide. Tethers were attached to mangrove roots or dead

Individuals were left in the field for 24 hours and then checked for survival as well as any indications of predation (e.g. pieces of carapace remaining on tether) during low tide. This tethering protocol was repeated four times in each habitat for a total of 149 individuals (mangrove n = 78, mixed marsh n = 71). Because the two habitat types have different physical and structural characteristics, we avoided differences in tethering artifacts between habitats (see review by [
