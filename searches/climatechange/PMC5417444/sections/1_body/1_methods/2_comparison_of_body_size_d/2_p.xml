<p class="p">At each of these representative sites, we collected female crabs (mean sample size ± SE = 57.17 ± 4.14 at each time point) as described previously. This sampling (mangrove: June (n = 41), July (n = 62), August (n = 53), marsh: June (n = 55), July (n = 58), August (n = 69)) increased our total sample size for the representative mangrove and marsh sites to n = 156 and n = 182, respectively. For each individual, we measured CW to the nearest tenth of a millimeter and determined their reproductive status (ovigerous or not ovigerous). Because

From these surveys, we compared body size distribution patterns of reproductively mature and gravid females, as well as the proportion of females that were gravid at each of the three monthly samples.
