<p class="p">We conducted additional surveys throughout the summer reproductive peak (June, July, and August 2013) to further investigate body size distributions and reproductive effort. Due to logistical constraints, these additional surveys were restricted to two representative sites: a representative mature mangrove forest (Avalon State Park, Fort Pierce, FL, 27.55°N) and a representative mixed marsh (Anastasia State Park, St. Augustine, FL, 29.87°N), which were chosen after careful consideration of several factors. Both sites (1) exemplify the prominent characteristics of each habitat type, (2) occur at relatively similar latitudes but are neither the northernmost nor southernmost site surveyed for each habitat type, and (3) initial surveys demonstrated that body size patterns at the two sites were consistent with the overall latitudinal patterns described here, which were established based on 12 sampling sites and two additional sites identified from the literature [
