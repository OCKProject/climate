<p class="p">Body size data was analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s F-test in order to compare mean size and size variability between the two populations, respectively. Additionally, Hartigan’s dip test for unimodality [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] was calculated to determine the body size distribution (unimodal, bimodal, etc.) of both reproductively mature (i.e. above the site-specific size at maturity but not ovigerous) and gravid females in the population in order to elucidate whether a single cohort or multiple cohorts were reproducing simultaneously in each habitat type. The proportion of gravid females in each habitat type was determined for each monthly survey by dividing the total number of gravid females by the total number of females larger than the site-specific size at maturity from each monthly sampling effort. This data was analyzed using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and month and habitat as categorical explanatory variables.
