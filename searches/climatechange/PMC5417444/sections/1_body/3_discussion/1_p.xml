<p class="p">Our study demonstrates that there is significant variation in key life history traits throughout the current geographic distribution of the mangrove tree crab 
 <italic class="italic">Aratus pisonii</italic>. In accordance with traditional biogeographic patterns (i.e. Bergmann’s clines), intraspecific body size, including both size at maturity and average size of reproductive females, increased with latitude within native mangrove habitats. However, this Bergmann’s cline deteriorated in mixed marsh and pure marsh sites at the northernmost latitudes of the species’ distribution. On average, gravid females in marshes at the highest latitudes of the species’ range were just 60% as large as those in the mangroves at lower latitudes. Although it is possible that our method of establishing size at maturity may underestimate intraspecific plasticity within a site, intraspecific body size, including both size at maturity and average size of reproductive females, clearly differed between habitats. This life history pattern suggests that
