<p class="p">Variation in size at maturity between habitats was also accompanied by differences in the population structure of reproductive females, which clearly contrasted between native and novel habitats. Specifically, the body size distribution of reproductive females was bimodal in the mangroves and unimodal in the mixed marsh habitat. These distributions suggest that two cohorts (each represented by a peak in body size distribution) are reproducing simultaneously in the population from the native mangrove habitat, while in the marsh population, either a single cohort is reproducing or reduced growth increments prevent the identification of discrete size/age classes. From our data, it is not evident whether differences in the size of ovigerous females reflect true differences in body size at a specific age or merely differences in body size at a particular life stage. Regrettably, a reliable technique to directly determine age in crustaceans does not currently exist [
