<p class="p">In addition to the observed differences in population structure and female size at maturity in mangrove and marsh habitats, fecundity increased significantly with maternal body size, a trait commonly observed in crustaceans (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]). Differences in the size of reproductive females in the two habitats therefore resulted in a higher mean nonstandardized fecundity (mean no. eggs/ individual) in native mangrove habitats than novel marsh habitats. Initial maternal investment in individual eggs, as measured by the mean egg volume and egg weight of recently extruded eggs, was not impacted by maternal habitat. However, offspring quality, as measured by larval starvation resistance, was improved in native mangrove habitats compared to novel salt marsh habitats. Because there was no relationship between egg volume or weight and maternal habitat, these differences in starvation resistance likely reflect differences in the quality, but not the quantity, of egg provisioning, which could result from habitat-wide differences in maternal physiological condition or previous reproductive investment. These differences in offspring quality may have enduring consequences for the survival and persistence of this species in novel habitats.
