<p class="p">Although we did not explicitly compare temperature profiles from the two habitats, the structural complexity of mangrove forests provides numerous shady microhabitats that are lacking in more structurally simplistic marsh habitats. It is well-established that forest canopies maintain lower temperature maximums than contiguous forest gaps or grassy habitats ([

Thus, individuals with access to the shaded mangrove understory may experience lower maximum temperatures than their conspecifics in less structurally complex salt marsh habitats. Consequently, our results are consistent with those predicted by the temperature-size rule after incorporating habitat-specific differences within its framework.
