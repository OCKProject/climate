<p class="p">It should be noted that interpretation of the temperature-size rule in this scenario is inherently complicated by habitat-specific differences in resource quality and availability. For example, diet quality has been shown to reverse the temperature-size rule in insects: in laboratory experiments, individuals reared on a high quality diet followed the temperature-size rule, while those reared on a low quality diet showed a reversed response, with smaller final sizes at higher temperatures [
