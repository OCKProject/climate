 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The temperature-size rule describes the phenotypically plastic relationship between body size at different developmental stages (e.g. reproductive maturity) and rearing temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. As a result of this phenotypic response to temperature during ontogeny, individuals reared at low temperatures delay maturity, reaching maturity at a larger body size and growing to be larger overall than conspecifics reared at warmer temperatures [
