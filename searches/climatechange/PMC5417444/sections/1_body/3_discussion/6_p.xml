<p class="p">Conversely, mangrove leaves are scarce or entirely absent in novel marsh and mixed marsh sites, forcing individuals to consume alternative food sources. Although little is known about the diet of

 <italic class="italic">pisonii</italic> in the marsh, a number of scenarios are possible. First, individuals in the marsh may consume a diet containing less animal material or poorer quality vegetation than those in the mangroves. In this case, the crabs in the marsh would be expected to have a slower growth rate than their conspecifics in the mangroves. Alternatively, crabs in the marsh may consume more animal material than those in the mangroves, which would be expected to increase their physiological condition and growth rate [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). Thus, habitat-specific differences in consumption of small prey items such as insects, juvenile conspecifics, or other crustaceans may influence the strength of the relationship between temperature and body size in these two habitats (e.g. [
