 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] for a list of reviews). Bergmann [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] originally addressed this topic by noting that endotherms in cooler temperatures (i.e. higher latitudes) tend to have larger body sizes than those in warmer temperatures (i.e. lower latitudes) as a result of thermoregulatory mechanisms. Bergmann’s clines are now commonly used to describe intraspecific patterns in the body size of both endotherms and ectotherms across latitude [
