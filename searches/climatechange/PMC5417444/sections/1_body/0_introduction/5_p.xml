<p class="p">We identified latitudinal patterns of life history traits (female size at maturity and average size at reproduction) of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pisonii</italic> across a broad (13.73°) latitudinal gradient that included its native mangrove habitat and novel salt marsh vegetation. Additionally, for a representative of each habitat type (native mangrove and novel mixed marsh) we compared the proportion of females actively reproducing at multiple time points as well as fecundity and metrics of maternal investment (egg volume and weight) and offspring quality (larval starvation resistance). Finally, because selection pressures such as predation may vary between habitats, and this may influence the life history traits of interest here (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]), we used simple metrics designed to assess the ability of individuals to utilize the vegetation structure in novel habitats as a potential predator evasion strategy, and compared size-specific predation risk in both native and novel habitats.
