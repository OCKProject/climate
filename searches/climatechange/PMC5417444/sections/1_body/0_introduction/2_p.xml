<p class="p">Because different taxonomic groups display variation in their sensitivity and response to climate changes, species often shift their ranges at different speeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These differences in the speed of range expansion have the potential to lead to spatial mismatches between previously interacting species [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. When rapidly expanding species expand their range faster than their neighbors, this process creates novel ecosystems with unique community assemblages and plant-animal interactions [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The resulting novel communities often represent a suite of new selection pressures that may prompt rapid changes in plastic life history traits in range-expanding organisms [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Because many organisms already exist across historically broad ranges in which they display latitudinal clines in life history traits, selection pressures associated with their range expansion may alter existing biogeographic life history patterns [
