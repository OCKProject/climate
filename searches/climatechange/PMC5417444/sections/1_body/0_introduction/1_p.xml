<p class="p">In recent decades, changes in global climate trends have led to radical alterations in natural ecosystems. A number of systems have experienced losses in biodiversity as well as changes in the composition and dynamics of communities [

Because the geographic ranges of most plants and animals are limited to some extent by climatic factors (i.e. temperature, light, precipitation) [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], changes in global climate trends have caused many species to shift or expand their distributions to include higher altitudes and more poleward latitudes [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. For example, species whose ranges are constrained by the cold are expanding their distributions poleward in response to warming temperatures, with terrestrial species expanding at an average rate of 16.9 km each decade [
