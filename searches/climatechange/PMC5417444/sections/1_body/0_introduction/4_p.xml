 <italic class="italic">Aratus pisonii</italic> (mangrove tree crab). It is one of numerous species whose recent climate-induced range expansion has led to a spatial mismatch with a habitat-forming plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Within its native habitat, this neotropical mangrove crab exists in close association with several mangrove species, including red, black, and white mangroves (
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora mangle</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Avicennia germinans</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Laguncularia racemosa</italic>, respectively). In particular, the red mangrove

 <italic class="italic">mangle</italic> provides both food and shelter for this arboreal species [
 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Although mangroves in Florida have experienced a substantial recent poleward expansion along the Atlantic coast due to a decrease in the frequency of extreme cold events [

 <xref rid="pone.0176263.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]) has outpaced that of its native habitat and the species has established itself in novel vegetation in temperate salt marshes [
