<p class="p">Female size at maturity increased significantly with latitude, but this trend was countered by the species’ range expansion into novel marsh habitats, as size at maturity was smaller in marshes at the highest latitudes of the species range than in any of the mangrove habitats surveyed (GLM, Latitude: mean slope ± SE = 0.373 ± 0.097, P = 0.003; Habitat: parameter estimate ± SE = 7.986 ± 1.202, P&lt;0.001,

Similarly, the average size of ovigerous females increased with latitude (GLM, Latitude: mean slope ± SE = 0.312 ± 0.046, P&lt;0.001), but this trend was reversed at the highest latitudes of the species’ range, where gravid individuals were significantly smaller in novel marsh habitats than native mangrove habitats (GLM, Habitat: parameter estimate ± SE = 8.358 ± 0.313, P&lt;0.001).
