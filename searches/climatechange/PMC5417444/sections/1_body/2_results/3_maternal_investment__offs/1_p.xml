<p class="p">Initial maternal investment in eggs, as measured by mean volume of non-eyed eggs, was not impacted by maternal habitat (GLM, mean slope ± SE = 0.001 ± 0.002, P = 0.759,

Similarly, individual egg weight (mean for both habitat types = 0.00729 mg), as measured by the slope of the regression between egg count and weight, did not differ between habitat types (GLM, mean slope ± SE = 0.063 ± 0.065, P = 0.343). Larval starvation resistance was significantly impacted by habitat type, with offspring from mothers in the mangroves demonstrating enhanced starvation resistance compared to those from mothers in the mixed marsh (mixed effect Cox model, Maternal habitat: Coefficient ± SE = 0.855 ± 0.300, P = 0.004,
