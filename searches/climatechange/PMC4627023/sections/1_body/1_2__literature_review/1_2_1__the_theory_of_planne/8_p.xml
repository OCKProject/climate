<p class="p">The TPB has been applied to a wide range of human behaviors [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and the TPB and related modified models have often been used to examine the pro-environmental intentions and behaviors of various groups of people [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Ajzen [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] noted that the TPB is open to the inclusion of additional predictors if they can be shown to capture a significant proportion of the variance in intentions or behavior after the theoryâ€™s current variables have been taken into account. Thus, to advance analysis using the TPB, this study presents variables to include in the TPB model, among others, that might increase its explanatory power.
