<p class="p">SEM was applied, and most of the indicators in this study fit the corresponding constructs of the ECC model well (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-13162-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-13162-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Squared multiple correlations (SMCs) showed that all the observed variables reflected the constructs (latent variables) effectively (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-13162-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>).
