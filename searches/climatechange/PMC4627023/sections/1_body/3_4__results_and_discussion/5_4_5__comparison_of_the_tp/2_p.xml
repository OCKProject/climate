 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] argued that a PGFI value under 0.5 indicates an unacceptable fit to the model. The PGFI value of the ECC model was 0.618, suggesting that the parsimony of the ECC model is acceptable. Moreover, the ECC model explained 61.9% of the variation in IEA, which is greater than that explained by the TPB (58.4%). Thus, the ECC model is superior to the TPB in explaining variation in the intention to purchase energy-efficient appliances.
