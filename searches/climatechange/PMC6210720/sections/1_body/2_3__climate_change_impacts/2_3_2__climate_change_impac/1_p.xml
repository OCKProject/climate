<p class="p">Changes in climate are expected to severely affect the performance of the agriculture sector, with detrimental effects on progress in achieving food and nutrition security [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The Fourth and Fifth Assessment reports (AR4 and AR5) reported with medium confidence that agricultural systems in Africa (including southern Africa) were vulnerable to climate change impacts. Empirical evidence shows that agricultural productivity in SADC would be significantly affected by projected changes in climate. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02306-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows that agricultural productivity in the region will decrease from 15% to 50% by 2080 due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This is worrying as the region, with the exception of South Africa and Zambia, already faces deficits for the major staple crops. Any further decreases would worsen regional food and nutrition insecurity.
