<p class="p">Climate change also has an impact on mental health and psychological and social wellbeing. It can cause minimal stress and distress symptoms, and clinical disorders, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recovery fatigue, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Previous studies noted that the threat of climate change is a psychological and emotional stressor as people become affected by direct exposure to climate-related events and information about the phenomenon and its effects [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Low income groups, indigenous groups, children, old people, women, outdoor labourers, and people with pre-existing health conditions, tend to be disproportionately impacted, mentally and physically, by the impacts of climate change [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The hardest hit are the marginalised who already spend a disproportionate amount of resources on food [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projects an increase in food prices by 30â€“50% in the coming decades due to adverse environmental factors, namely, land degradation, climate change, and water scarcity; low-income groups will be the hardest hit as such increases bear health implications [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Niang et al. reported that, in 2009, global food price increases contributed to the deaths of approximately 30,000 to 50,000 malnourished children in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Thus, climate change is increasing the problems of undernutrition due to low yields and increases in food prices. These challenges are threatening to reverse development gains and impede the achievement of SDGs on no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, good water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and climate action (Goals 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13).
