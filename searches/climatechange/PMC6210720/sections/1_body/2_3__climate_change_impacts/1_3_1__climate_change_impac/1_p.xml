The region is marked by a great spatio-temporal variability in climate and water resources, particularly in southern drier countries [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02306-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>f represents the rainfall pattern of 2007, showing that almost half of the surface area of the SADC region has become arid, receiving less than 650 mm of rainfall. It is projected that for southern Africa, climate change impacts would mostly be felt through water resources [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The estimated reductions of about 20% in rainfall by 2080 could exacerbate water, energy, and food insecurity if no action is taken [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This would negatively impact food production and energy generation. In addition, there would be indirect impacts on nutrition, health and sanitation, water conflicts, among other social challenges.
