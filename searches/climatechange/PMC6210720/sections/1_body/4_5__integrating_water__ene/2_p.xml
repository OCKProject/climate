 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the region is water scarce (physical and economic) due to the uneven distribution of water resources [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Mean annual runoff volume is 650 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, a low volume for a region that depends on rainfed agriculture and hydro-power for energy [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The uneven distribution of hydrological resources favours a coordinated approach with benefit-sharing mechanisms to manage the regionâ€™s resources. The region could also benefit from water transfer and hydropower generation as the northern parts of the region have abundant water resources and could supply the southern parts with water [

The shared natural resources provide a basis for the development of regional instruments to support cooperation in resource management for inclusive development and cement regional integration, given that the impacts of and responses to climate change are generally cross-sectoral [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The integration of climate change into regional policies, plans, and strategies is an important means of encouraging action on climate change adaptation, as policy gives political will.
