 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, there has been lack of coordination among policies and institutions, and that has resulted in policy spill-overs and transferring challenges to other sectors [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. There is, therefore, a need for policy harmonisation, which is the very reason of the WEF nexus approach in resources management. To-date, the region has ratified the following WEF nexus-related institutions and policies:

   <p class="p">The Regional Strategic Action Plan IV (RSAP IV) [
    <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], based on the SADC Water Policy and Strategy, which advocates for equitable and sustainable utilisation of water for social and environmental justice, regional integration, and economic benefit for present and future generations. The RSAP IV emphasises infrastructure development and water resource management for food security in the water-food nexus, and an urgency to act in light of climate variability and change.

   <p class="p">The SADC protocol on shared watercourses [
    <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] promotes co-operation for judicious, sustainable, and coordinated management, protection, and utilisation of shared watercourses, and advancement of SADC’s agenda on regional integration and poverty alleviation. Most shared river basins have basin level agreements in place, which oversee the management of the basins. Examples of shared river basin agreements include the Limpopo Watercourse Commission (LIMCOM), Okavango River Basin Commission (OKACOM), Orange-Senqu River Commission (ORASECOM), and Zambezi River Basin Commission (ZAMCOM).

    <xref rid="B64-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] highlights the development and updating of a regional electricity master plan, and the development and utilisation of electricity in an environmentally sound manner, whilst emphasising the need for universal access to affordable and quality services. The SAPP is guided by the Protocol on Energy and enhances regional co-operation in power development and trade, and to provide non-binding regional master plans to guide electricity generation and transmission infrastructure delivery.
