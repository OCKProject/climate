<p class="p">Within the region, the dominant development paradigm is underpinned by sectors that are highly exposed to climate variability and change, especially agriculture, hydropower, and water infrastructure [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. As such, there is a need to approach development from a cross-sectoral perspective as the challenges faced are cross-cutting and most resources are also transboundary in nature [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In this regard, emerging cross-sectoral approaches such as the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus could be useful [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The WEF nexus is broadly defined as an approach that considers the interactions, synergies, harmonisation, and trade-offs between water, energy, and food when undertaking the management of these resources [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It is because of this cross-sectoral approach to resource planning and management that the WEF nexus is an important tool in climate change adaptation. WEF resources are inextricably linked, with usage within one sector influencing the use and availability in the adjacent sectors. The WEF nexus has been studied widely, with various studies focusing their analyses on niches or sectors, be they political, social, or scientific perspectives [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The WEF nexus tackles these ‘silo’ approaches to resource management. Unlike Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), which is water-centric in nature, the WEF nexus considers all resources with equal weighting and manages resources more holistically through a multi-centric philosophy [
