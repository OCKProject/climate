<p class="p">Climate change-associated extreme weather events, such as droughts and flooding, have emerged as the biggest challenges faced by the fast growing and emerging economies in southern Africa. Temperature is expected to continue warming and rainfall patterns are projected to continue changing, thereby increasing risk and uncertainty in a region with low adaptive capacity [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Changes in temperature and rainfall will be felt variably across the region, with some areas becoming warmer and wetter, while others will become warmer and drier [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Previous studies on climate change scenarios highlight that the latter scenario will be more dominant across southern Africa, with climate change impacts being mostly associated with declining rainfall [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In terms of economic development, climate change is described as a wicked problem, because it is complex and straddles various sectors and levels [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Responses to climate change therefore necessitate transdisciplinary or cross-sectoral approaches [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Current approaches to climate change adaptation are similar to the regionâ€™s sectoral framing for planning and development, which has often led to mal-adaptation as trade-offs are not accounted for.
