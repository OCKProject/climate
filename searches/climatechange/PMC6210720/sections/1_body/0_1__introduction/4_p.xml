<p class="p">Currently, national and regional development targets remain elusive due, in part, to sectoral approaches to resource management, which inadvertently create imbalances and inefficiencies in resource allocation and utilisation, respectively [

 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This is particularly concerning for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region due to the recurrence of climate change associated extreme weather events and high climatic variability, particularly droughts and floods. Water, energy, and food resources are vital for human wellbeing, poverty reduction, and sustainable development and their management is vital to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to integrate climate change adaption strategies [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This would translate to savings from costs associated with duplication of developmental projects, increased efficiencies due to streamlining of activities, and higher likelihood of success due to mitigation of trade-offs and amplification of synergies [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02306" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Adoption of the WEF nexus approach calls for transformative change with regards to institutional arrangements, governance, and alignment as well as public and private participation. The pressure to produce more food and energy with less water requires a paradigm shift from the current ‘silo’ approach to cross-sectoral approach through the WEF nexus [
