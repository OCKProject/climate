   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Calculated in-stream BOD concentration profiles from headwater to river mouth for the year 2000 along the main stem of the Rhine and Yamuna-Ganges rivers. Without natural degradation and wastewater treatment (purple profiles), BOD concentrations gradually increase along the densely populated Rhine, whereas for the Yamuna-Ganges river a rapid increase near the cities of Delhi and Agra is followed by dilution with freshwater from several large tributaries. Pollutant loading from livestock farming adds significant pollution in both basins (red profiles). When natural degradation is taken into account (yellow profiles), BOD concentrations decrease significantly in both rivers, illustrating the self-cleaning capacity of natural rivers
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Wastewater treatment (blue profiles) further reduces BOD concentrations, especially in the Rhine, but also near Delhi and Agra, which have higher rates of wastewater treatment than smaller cities further downstream
