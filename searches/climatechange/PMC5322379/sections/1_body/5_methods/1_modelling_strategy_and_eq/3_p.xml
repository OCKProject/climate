<p class="p">Estimating in-stream BOD concentrations along discretized river networks is based on a local mass balance that relates downstream concentration in a river segment or grid cell to concentrations in upstream segments: C
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is BOD concentration in segment i (mg/l) after mixing, Q
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is discharge in segment i (l/day), x
 <sub class="sub">j</sub> is length of river segment j (m), E
 <sub class="sub">W, i</sub> is local BOD load from urban wastewater and intensive livestock farming into segment i (mg/day), calculated as:
