<p class="p">Calculations for the year 2050 are based on mean projected urban population, intensive livestock farming and discharge, derived from an ensemble of two IPCC emission scenarios (A2 - fast growth, and B1 - slow growth), three coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs), and one Global Hydrological Model (GHM), i.e. WaterGAP
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Projections suggest that air temperature will increase by about 1 °C in 2050, relative to the 1986–2005 period
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. A sensitivity analysis showed that an increase in air temperature of 2 °C would lead to an increase in annual average river temperature of 1.3 °C
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. A worldwide projected increase of average first-order decay rates due to global warming is up to 10%
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>, a small change, suggesting that the direct temperature effect of climate change on river BOD concentrations is small, especially compared to effects of changes in river discharge.
