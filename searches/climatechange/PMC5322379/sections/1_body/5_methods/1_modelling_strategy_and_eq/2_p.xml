 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows a conceptual diagram of our approach for computing in-stream BOD concentrations as a function of urban organic pollution production, wastewater treatment, intensive livestock farming, upstream-downstream transport, dilution, and natural degradation. The approach follows Voβ

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> also included BOD in their global analysis but did not account for natural degradation, neither did they look at future changes. Our calculation is implemented on a 0.5-degree grid, and thus only major rivers are taken into account, with urban regions and intensive farming areas that are within 5 km of a major stream included as point sources.
