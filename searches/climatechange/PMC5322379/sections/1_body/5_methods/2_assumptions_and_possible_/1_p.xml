<p class="p">Here, we discuss the rationale behind several model assumptions, and outline possible model extensions in light of available data. A first group of assumptions relates to sources of organic river pollution that are not explicitly included in the model:
 <list id="l1" list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">
    <underline class="underline">industrial sources</underline>: a previous continental-scale study in Europe
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref> concluded that organic loads from domestic and livestock farming sources are each at least ten times greater than contributions from industrial activities. As such, organic pollution from industry is considered a secondary driver and not included in the model. However, locally, industrial pollution may still be an important factor: areas where our model underestimates observed concentrations due to potential industrial activities are identified and discussed in the Supplement. In the absence of globally extensive datasets, efforts to add industrial sources to the model should focus on these areas first.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">
    <underline class="underline">agricultural non-point sources</underline>: by their very nature, non-point sources, such as extensive livestock farming and manure applied to agricultural fields, contribute much lower BOD values than effluents from intensive livestock farming, albeit over larger areas. Previous work
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref> in extensive livestock areas suggests that in-stream BOD levels exceed the range of natural water only during dry periods. Our model is limited to long-term average conditions (steady-state) and ignores such seasonal or shorter-term effects on organic pollution.

    <underline class="underline">rural domestic sources</underline>: following other global river pollution studies
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>, we assumed that organic pollutants from rural areas do not enter rivers due to either collection of human waste in latrines and septic tanks, or retention and degradation in soil.
