<p class="p">Finally, as with other climate change studies, our projections are subject to uncertainties in future population (e.g. grid-scale projected changes in urban population assume uniform exponential growth rates across each country
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" class="xref">50</xref>) and river discharge as simulated by a limited number of scenarios and generally imperfect global climate-hydrological models
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. We note that projected river discharge applied in our model generally agrees with forecasting from IPCC (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, one aim of our study is to estimate consequences of river pollution in the absence of additional investments in wastewater treatment. Thus, our projected results rely on the assumption that wastewater treatment remains at current levels.
