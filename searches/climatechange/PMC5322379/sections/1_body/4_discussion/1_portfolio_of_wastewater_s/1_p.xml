<p class="p">Given that projected impacts are largest in developing regions, where wastewater treatment is still limited (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S6</xref>), there is an urgent and growing need for affordable wastewater solutions. In developed countries, organic river pollution from urban effluents has historically been reduced by a combination of environmental regulation and large-scale wastewater treatment
