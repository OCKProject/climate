 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S8</xref>), the latter due to climate change and changes in water extractions to support a growing global population. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the effect of temperature change on natural degradation is secondary (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">section S1</xref>) and it is thus not included. In all scenarios, wastewater treatment rates are kept constant at their current levels. As such, computed results give an indication of pollution impacts in the absence of additional investments beyond current treatment capacity to curb the global sanitation crisis.
