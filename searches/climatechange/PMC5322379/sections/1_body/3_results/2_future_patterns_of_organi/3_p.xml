<p class="p">In terms of number of people affected, except for the Rhine, all basins listed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> are projected to experience increasing impacts in 2050 compared to 2000, with the largest increases in Ganges, Indus, Nile, and Niger. Reasons for these increases differ by basin. Urban population growth for the Yellow and Huai, Yangtze, and Mississippi, decreases in river discharge for the Danube basin, and a combination of all three factors for the Ganges, Indus, Parana, Nile, and Niger basins. Globally, a total of 2.5 billion people (26% of global population) will be affected by living near polluted rivers (BOD &gt;5â€‰mg/l) in the year 2050, up from 1.1 billion people (19%) in the year 2000. Basins listed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> account for about half of affected people. This is a conservative estimate because several factors not accounted for in our analysis (industrial pollution, eutrophication, seasonal discharge cycles and smaller streams with limited dilution capacity) would further increase these numbers
