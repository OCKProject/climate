<p class="p">The level of organic pollution in a river, commonly expressed by the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, is the result of two counteracting mechanisms: pollutant loading and natural cleaning (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Wastewater discharge from cities and intensive livestock farms constitute the main organic pollutant loads into rivers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. With rapid urban population growth expected in the next decades, both sources of organic pollution will increase
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Although pollution is introduced at wastewater discharge points along the river, impacts extend to downstream populations and ecosystems, as pollutants are transported through the river network
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. The extent of downstream impacts depends on self-cleaning capacities of rivers via dilution by natural runoff and natural degradation by micro-organisms, as illustrated for two major basins in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Changes in river discharge due to climate change affect river dilution capacities, increasing the risk of river pollution in areas that experience reductions in climate wetness

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Increases in water extractions to support a growing global population may further decrease river dilution capacities.
