Countries that lack adaptive capacity, vulnerable populations (e.g., indigenous peoples, people relying on agricultural livelihoods) and certain regions facing severe challenges, such as small island developing states and the Arctic, are more vulnerable to its impacts [

The efforts of countries to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are threatened by climate change (e.g., SDG 1—No poverty; SDG 2—End hunger; SDG 3—Good health and well-being; and SDG 6—Clean water and sanitation) [
