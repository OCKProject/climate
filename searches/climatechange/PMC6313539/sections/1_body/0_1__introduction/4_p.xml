<p class="p">This paper reviews the evolution of V&amp;As as part of efforts by governments and experts to better understand and respond to climate change risks to health. It provides information on the type of guidance that has been developed for conducting V&amp;As and summarizes national and subnational assessments that have been conducted. The importance of assessments in helping to build the global evidence-base of climate change impacts on health is highlighted along with observations on the implementation of findings to support health adaptation action. Recommendations are then provided about supporting future V&amp;As, establishing local to global baselines of climate change health risks, vulnerabilities and adaptation activities and applying the knowledge generated to protect the health of populations. </p>
