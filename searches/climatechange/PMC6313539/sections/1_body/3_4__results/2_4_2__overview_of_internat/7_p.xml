<p class="p">Since 2009, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) has supported state, tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies to use evidence-based information to better understand and predict the health risks of climate change and prepare programs to respond and protect health. Through the Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI) and the supporting Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework [

A review of CRSCI activities found that the program had increased the capacity of local health authorities to prepare for and respond to climate change by providing information about climate change impacts on health and vulnerable populations [

Specifically, the program supported development of practice-informed guidance on quantitative risk assessment methods, greater integration of health considerations within the climate change agenda in the respective jurisdictions and the creation of new networks for sharing information. Experiences of grantees revealed the need for greater efforts to enhance knowledge of climate modeling tools and their use in disease burden projections among public health professionals [
