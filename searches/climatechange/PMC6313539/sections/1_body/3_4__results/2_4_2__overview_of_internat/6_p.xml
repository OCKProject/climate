<p class="p">Subnational assessments allow for more localized analysis of the health impacts of climate change including a more accurate estimation of current and future vulnerabilities to inform effective adaptation planning. They may also allow researchers to focus limited resources on priority areas (e.g., large urban centers, areas with high proportions of vulnerable people, areas believed to be at increased risk, such as coastal areas). In geographically large countries, such as Canada and the United States that span multiple ecozones/biomes, the anticipated health impacts of climate change may vary widely from one area to another [

Subnational assessments provide the opportunity to identify and address locally specific health risks that may otherwise be overlooked in a national context (e.g., an invasive vector-borne disease only likely to impact a particular region of a country) and develop locally appropriate response options.
