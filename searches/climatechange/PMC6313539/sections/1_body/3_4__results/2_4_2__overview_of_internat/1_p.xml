<p class="p">Climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments have been conducted at national and subnational scales for over 20 years. The mandate and resources for conducting V&amp;As among countries varies greatly. While many assessments in developing countries have been supported by WHO as part of its technical support to countries, others have been triggered by the need to provide sectoral inputs to National Communications to the UNFCCC, and in some instances, are government mandated. For example, national climate change assessments are mandated in the U.S. by Congress through the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990 and assessments in the UK through the 2008 Climate Change Act.

In contrast, V&amp;As completed by many developing countries may involve only 12–30 national experts engaged for shorter time frames (e.g., three to nine months) and those supported by WHO in the past had much smaller budgets, on average between 50,000–100,000 USD.
