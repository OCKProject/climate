<p class="p">Effective measures to protect health from climate change impacts require assessments that further the understanding and integration of information about local and population level vulnerabilities [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This includes analysis of exposure and sensitivities to hazards, regional weather and climate drivers; such studies benefit from participation of a range of stakeholders at the community level [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To facilitate efforts by public health officials to assess current and future impacts of climate change on health, guidance and methods for conducting assessments have been developed over the last two decades by building on fundamental principles and theoretical models from environmental health impact assessment [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The first comprehensive guide for conducting climate change and health assessments was developed by the WHO European Office, in collaboration with WMO, Health Canada (HC) and UNEP in 2003 [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It presented a framework and key steps for conducting an assessment, and described quantitative and qualitative methods to establish associations of local climate and weather conditions with health outcomes using specific health impact areas as examples [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The guidance also included discussion of useful tools and methods for conducting assessments based upon the principles of environmental health impact assessment, including environmental epidemiology (e.g., short and long time-series studies, ecological studies), geographical information systems, climate change, population and socioeconomic scenarios, climate and health modelling, biological models of infectious disease transmission, development of indicators, comparative risk assessment, integrated assessment, traditional knowledge, literature reviews, single event case studies, focus groups, participatory workshops, and cost-benefit analysis [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The report was generally tailored for researchers and provided limited information on health policy and program development. The assessment guidelines were reported to WHO to be complicated and cumbersome by a number of health authorities using them.
