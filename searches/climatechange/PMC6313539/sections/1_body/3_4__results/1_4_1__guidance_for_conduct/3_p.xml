<p class="p">In 2008, the Member States of WHO requested development of tools for conducting V&amp;As through a World Health Assembly Resolution [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. A new WHO workplan on climate change and health in 2009 included a strong emphasis on building evidence through such studies [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. WHO therefore developed new guidance which provided stronger direction on the assessment process including how to engage stakeholders and communicate the assessment findings. It also provided greater detail on the adaptation assessment process, such as identifying resources for implementation of options, potential barriers to action and inaction to protect health, as well as their approximate costs [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The guidance was developed and tested by WHO and its Regional Offices over 2007–2010. The document included 25 examples of assessment step implementation from a wide range of countries to make the guidance more accessible to public health officials in both developed and developing countries. A survey was administered in 2010 on the experiences of 12 countries that conducted V&amp;As using the new guidance, and a workshop was held in Costa Rica which convened health officials and experts from 15 countries to provide input toward development of the new document [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The new guide “Protecting health from climate change: Vulnerability and adaptation assessment” [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] was published by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO and outlines 5 steps (
