 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] laid the foundation for the evidence-base on climate change and health by describing what is known about the basic biology and epidemiology of diseases that were first characterized as “climate sensitive”, the direct and indirect pathways through which current climate variability and future climate change can impact health. They also described key decision-making processes supporting health adaptation [
