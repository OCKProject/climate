<p class="p">Greater knowledge of risks to health and well-being posed by climate change and guidance available to health authorities for assessing vulnerabilities has resulted in more local, regional and national studies being undertaken. Climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments provide invaluable information to health authorities to increase the resilience of individuals, communities and health systems to climate change impacts. They also contribute to development of the global evidence-base on climate change and health needed to inform adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation measures in the future, ensuring that they benefit the well-being of populations.</p>
