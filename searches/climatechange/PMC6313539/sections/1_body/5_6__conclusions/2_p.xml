<p class="p">Expanded efforts through V&amp;As to continue to build this global evidence base and inform the development of adaptations to protect against growing risks from climate hazards require further development of both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods, tools and guidance documents [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This would include, for example, prioritizing adaptation options, using qualitative methods to assess future impacts from climate change and developing indicators of health system resilience. Greater skill development in environmental health and epidemiology that includes tools and competencies for understanding health risks in the context of environmental and climate change will support health authorities in undertaking V&amp;As. The rigor of assessments would improve with more robust metrics and approaches for estimating adaptive capacity and the effectiveness of current adaptations, as well as with more climate scenario and modelling information applicable to regional and local scales. Enhanced understanding of systemic, synergistic, cascading or compounding health effects from climate change needs to be included in V&amp;As to prepare for potentially severe, or catastrophic events. The use of V&amp;As as a key tool to support effective adaptation to the health impacts of climate change will benefit from increased collaboration, exchange and learning among health authorities as they continue to undertake these studies in the future.
