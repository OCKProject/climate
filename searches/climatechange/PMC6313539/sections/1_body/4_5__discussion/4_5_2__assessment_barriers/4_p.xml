<p class="p">Particular obstacles may face developing countries in conducting V&amp;As. National analyses of health risks and future impacts are often challenged by the availability of national and local data, which are often insufficient to establish robust linear and non-linear relationships among health outcomes and climate variables. In addition, those conducting assessments often lack both high quality and long-term climate and epidemiological data and have few pre-existing local studies to consider within a V&amp;A. They may also have few climate and health models for application, low capacity within country teams to conduct the analysis, and limited financial resources and time to contract appropriate academic teams to conduct more sophisticated studies.
