<p class="p">In the short-term, policy and program managers often require information from V&amp;As to inform near-term decisions related to staffing, procurement, and programming, for example for efforts to address a particular intervention (e.g., heat-health warning systems, health promotion campaign, disaster management plan, food safety program) found to be ineffective. This can present a fundamental challenge in applying the results of V&amp;A assessments to decision-making. Adaptation options identified in assessments may include important recommendations to strengthen health system management, such as strengthened surveillance, training and capacity building, but lack recommendations for immediate actions. In such cases, gaining buy-in of decision makers that action is required is difficult because results pertaining to near-term adaptations are not included in the study. This type of information requires analysis of how current climate and extreme weather events are driving and influencing health outcomes and health system performance in a country or region. This analysis is often not possible with existing resources (e.g., data, financial, expertise, time) for the assessment. However, improved understanding and analysis of current seasonality, inter-annual climate patterns, conditions and projections of extreme rainfall, temperature, and drought in the country can provide decision-relevant information that is easily applied to current planning cycles, and is also likely representative of future climate conditions.</p>
