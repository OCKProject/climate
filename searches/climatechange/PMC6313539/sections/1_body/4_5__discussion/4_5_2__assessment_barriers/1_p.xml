<p class="p">In the face of increasing calls for more information about climate change impacts on health and interest from health authorities in undertaking assessments, a number of important barriers exist in completing these studies. A key challenge for health authorities conducting V&amp;As is to provide information in timescales relevant for decision making. To be most useful V&amp;As should provide rigorous findings that help policy makers identify both short-term and longer-term adaptation options. However, as highlighted above, WHO analysis of a sample of completed assessments indicated that only half included either qualitative or quantitative projections of future health impacts of climate change. Limited data, a paucity of climate and health models, uncertainty related to climate projections, and a lack of resources, expertise or time often make estimating future health impacts of climate change in a region or community difficult. Robust indicators that can be used to track: (1) vulnerability, risk, and exposure of populations and health systems to climate change hazards; (2) actual impacts from such hazards; and (3) progress in adapting and building resilience are lacking from local to national scales [

To ensure consistency in approaches and comparability of findings V&amp;As often consider and apply findings from existing national climate assessments conducted by the government or other sectors, including the same climate projections (e.g., global and regional SRES, RCP projections). This is useful to raise awareness that current health vulnerabilities, if not addressed now, may increase significantly in the future. However, in resource poor contexts this information alone is rarely sufficient to justify and motivate investments in health adaptation.
