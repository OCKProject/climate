<p class="p">National V&amp;As have been conducted relatively recently and time is needed to gauge accurately the degree to which findings and recommendations will inform concrete efforts to prepare for climate change impacts on health. It is possible that information from national level assessments is being used by health decision makers at other levels of government (e.g., local, regional) or by non-governmental partners to adapt. This could include efforts to raise awareness of impacts, build networks for cooperation, or pursue targeted actions such as the development of heat-health warning systems that warn the public of impending dangerous temperatures to support protective behaviors. </p>
