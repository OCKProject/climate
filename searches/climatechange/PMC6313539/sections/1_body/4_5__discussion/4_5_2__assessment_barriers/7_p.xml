<p class="p">Health authorities often have difficulty effectively translating the findings from a V&amp;A into adaptation practice to protect populations from current climate hazards and future climate change [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This includes little application of the knowledge produced into relevant policy processes at the national level such as the NAPs, the UNFCCC National Communications and Nationally Determined Contributions. Challenges can be faced by the health sector in efforts to engage in national climate change processes, which are most often led by the environmental sector. This may also occur because some assessments are not producing information and data most needed by decision makers to protect health and because of a lack of evidence informed activities and tools to support knowledge translation (e.g., spatial tools such as GIS, training kits, education and outreach materials, communities of practice) and facilitate efforts to reduce population health risks. As noted above, while two thirds of the V&amp;As reviewed by WHO indicated intent to use the findings to inform health adaptation planning, only one third identified specific populations vulnerable to climate change health impacts. In addition, Hayes and Poland [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] suggest that many V&amp;As have not included investigation of mental health impacts of climate change, a growing concern among health authorities. Decision makers are therefore often not receiving needed evidence-based information to develop targeted public health interventions to prepare for climate change.
