<p class="p">Robust V&amp;As build upon existing locally relevant evidence, which has already established associations between climate variables, tested data sets, and can describe local vulnerabilities and disease dynamics. However, many developing countries do not have this evidence base, or sufficient data and capacity to conduct this research, and are thus dependent upon proxy studies which may be relevant, but conducted in other locations. This is reflected in WHOâ€™s 2018 finding [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] that only half of the reviewed assessments were able to include future risk projections. V&amp;As in developing countries often focus their resources on establishing associations between weather and health outcomes and not future climate change due to this lack of existing evidence. They often conclude with recommendations for additional studies; closer collaboration between the international research community and local policy communities would help address these gaps.
