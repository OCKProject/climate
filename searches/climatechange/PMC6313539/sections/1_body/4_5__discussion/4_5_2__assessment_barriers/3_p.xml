<p class="p">Many V&amp;As also focus narrowly on building the evidence-base of climate-sensitivity related to specific health outcomes of concern for a specific jurisdiction, frequently measured as disease burdens. They often do not investigate in great enough detail the climate-sensitivity of broader components of the health system (e.g., health facilities, health workforce, new adaptation technologies, adaptation networks and partnerships) as identified in the WHO Operational Framework for Building Climate Resilient Health Systems [

This focus on disease outcomes can result in insufficient attention to potentially critical vulnerabilities and impacts from climate change on health-related sectors such as a projected collapse of food stocks, large-scale landscape changes due to sea-level rise or hydrological changes, or population migration from climate impacts. It also results in inadequate attention to measuring impacts on the health sector itself, such as those on health systems and facilities and on levels of adaptive capacity; information on such impacts could generate specific actionable recommendations. Future studies would benefit from greater focus on the potential impacts of climate change, including stresses and shocks, on health systems [
