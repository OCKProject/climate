<p class="p">Opportunities also exist to inform decision making with V&amp;A findings by integrating results into relevant initiatives within existing mechanisms and processes (e.g., HNAPs, Health and Environment Strategies Alliance (HESA), Situation Analysis and Needs Assessment (SANA), disaster risk reduction) that support efforts to protect health from climate change impacts. Although an important challenge, V&amp;As will benefit from efforts to increase knowledge of local level climate change risks to health and the needs of vulnerable populations. This can be achieved through the conduct of local and regional V&amp;As, as the US BRACE example discussion above illustrates, or by integrating such information into national studies (e.g., investigation of perceptions, adaptive capacity; use of case studies).</p>
