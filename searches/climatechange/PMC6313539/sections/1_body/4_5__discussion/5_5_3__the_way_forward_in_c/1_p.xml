Establishing health impact, vulnerability and adaptation baselines through a V&amp;A allows health authorities to monitor progress made, or adaptation failures, in efforts to protect the health of populations from climate change impacts. Most countries have not yet repeated their V&amp;A assessment to assess whether the baseline constructed in the first study is sufficient to monitor the success of adaptation efforts and the health outcomes related to climate change. In the future, WHO support for countries to undertake Climate and Health Country Profiles biennially [
