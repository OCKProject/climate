<p class="p">Climate change and health action by health authorities and partners can be strengthened by the development of indictors from local to national scales that capture trends among populations and health systems related to: (1) vulnerabilities, risks and exposures to climate hazards; (2) impacts from such hazards and (3) adaptation and resilience building. Regular tracking of climate change impacts with such indicators supports iterative risk management where evidence is synthesized through V&amp;As and then disseminated and applied through health adaptation [

As part of this approach, V&amp;As should be regularly updated to ensure health authorities are using the latest information about key vulnerabilities and are monitoring progress in addressing climate change impacts on health [
