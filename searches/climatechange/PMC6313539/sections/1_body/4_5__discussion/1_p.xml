<p class="p">Irrespective of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, climate change will continue for decades resulting in gradual warming punctuated by stresses and shocks that have the potential to severely impact individuals, communities and health systems. Learnings from engagement with researchers and decision makers in V&amp;As suggest that climate change is transforming the milieu in which public health officials and partners understand health risks and make decisions to reduce them due to:
