<p class="p">As V&amp;As by health authorities generate more robust evidence, this information can be integrated into international scientific reports including regular studies by the IPCC, the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate, and WHO, thereby providing a more comprehensive global evidence-base of the vulnerability of people to climate change impacts and progress being made to reduce risks. International reports facilitate a common understanding of the risks posed by climate change, improve access to climate and health data, support calls for action to address climate change and inform the development of new tools and methods for assessment. The WHO V&amp;A assessment guide [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02626" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] was informed by leading edge concepts, methods and frameworks related to climate impact assessment developed by bodies, such as the IPCC. In turn, evidence regarding risks and vulnerabilities to health from current climate variability and future climate change presented in these international reports contributes to the development of local to national V&amp;As.
