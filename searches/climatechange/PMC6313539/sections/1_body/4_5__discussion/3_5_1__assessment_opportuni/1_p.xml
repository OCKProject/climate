<p class="p">Climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments have assisted some health authorities and researchers in efforts to raise awareness of possible impacts on vulnerable populations, build capacity to prepare for impacts, understand data and evidentiary requirements for decision-making, and establish the required knowledge base for climate change adaptation in the health sector [

Assessments have also helped health authorities to integrate the needs of the health sector into national climate assessment and policy efforts. Ministries of Health, which have undertaken V&amp;As, are better prepared to join national and international policy fora and related processes on climate change (e.g., national adaptation planning and strategy development, UNFCCC negotiations, World Health Assembly), and to advocate for action which benefits health and builds the climate resiliency of the health sector.
