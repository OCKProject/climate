<p id="Par14" class="p">Extreme wet conditions can produce wet stress. This stress accumulates weekly once the soil moisture has passed a wet stress threshold (SMWS) at a given rate (HWS). Waterlogging may reduce growth, photosynthesis and cause a loss of biomass production or even death. Older maize plants are more tolerant to waterlogging than younger ones

 </sup>. The phenological stages that are more susceptible to waterlogging precede those of tasselling and flowering. Damage to the roots, due to the accumulation of toxic bioproducts, affect yields
