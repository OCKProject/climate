<p id="Par13" class="p">This stress starts to accumulate when the conditions are too dry for the species. The weekly dry stress threshold (SMDS) accumulates at a given rate (HDS). Maize is susceptible to drought, especially during flowering, tasselling, silking and pollination, as well as during the grain-filling stage during which a lack of water can cause losses of nearly 90%, with little or no grain yield
