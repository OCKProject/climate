<p id="Par10" class="p">Distribution data for India, China and neighbouring countries was not used for parameter fitting, but was reserved for model validation. The reasons for the choices of parameter values are described in detail below. Each parameter was manually and iteratively adjusted until an acceptable visual level of agreement was obtained between the potential and current distribution of maize. The stress indices were first adjusted to maintain the population within the observed distribution limits and to model the core distribution. After adjusting the stresses, the temperature and moisture indices were fixed. All of the CLIMEX parameters were compared with experimental biological data to ensure their validity (TableÂ
