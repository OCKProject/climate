<p id="Par19" class="p">Occurrence data from India, China and neighbouring countries was not used in the fitting process, but was reserved for the validation process. Once the parameter fitting was satisfactory, the validation area was verified to check the performance of the model in this region. Furthermore, a cross validation that is incorporated in CLIMEX was performed, using two maps of current maize distribution based on productivity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>
 </sup>. The agreement between the modelled historical potential distribution and the seasonal phenology of the modelled species in different areas provided the cross validation for the model
