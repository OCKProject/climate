<p id="Par9" class="p">CliMond provides 10′ (18.55 km) and 30′ (55 km) global high-resolution data for bioclimatic modelling for CLIMEX and Bioclim. CliMond data are based on WorldClim 10′ (minimum and maximum monthly temperature, monthly total precipitation) and CRU CL2·0 10′ (mean relative humidity). For this study, the climatology of 10′ gridded resolution data was used to model the potential current and future distribution of maize. The data were downloaded in CLIMEX format, containing average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures, average monthly precipitation and relative humidity at 9:00 hours and 15:00 hours

 </sup>. The future potential distribution was modelled using A2 SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) scenario (business as usual) for 2050 and 2100 based on two GCMs: CSIRO Mk3·0 from Australia

 </sup>. The CLIMEX CliMond climatology data are based on CSIRO and MIROC because these two GCMs have the climate data required for CLIMEX model and have superior performance in areas with a range of climates compared with other GCMs
