 </sup>. The data were verified for biological reasonability; furthermore, duplicate records and those without geographic coordinates were eliminated from the database. Nearly 15,000 records were gathered and used for parameter fitting, with more than 50% of the records representing Mexico. These records geographically represent the current known global distribution of maize (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The use of native and planted (agricultural) distribution records to adjust CLIMEX parameters could generate a better model that more accurately reproduces the potential distribution of the species of study, allowing for the expansion of the fundamental niche
