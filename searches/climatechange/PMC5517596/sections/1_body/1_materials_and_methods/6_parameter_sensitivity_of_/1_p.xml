<p id="Par18" class="p">The sensitivity analysis determines how the accuracy of the parameters affect the model output when applied on an individual basis. A parameter sensitivity analysis runs the model repeatedly, altering individual parameters successively to exceed their fitted values. This analysis was carried out with the global CliMond database. Variables with a greater effect on the model output are described as ‘sensitive’, whereas those that have no impact on the model output are termed ‘insensitive’
