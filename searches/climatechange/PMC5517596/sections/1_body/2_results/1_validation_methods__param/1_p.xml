<p id="Par22" class="p">The modelled distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) shows an acceptable match with the current known distribution of maize (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Approximately 96% of the occurrence records are classified in the marginal to optimal categories, while 88% of the occurrence records for the validation area (India, China and neighbouring countries) are located within the modelled marginal to optimal areas. The global distribution of You 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., (2014) and Leff 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., (2004), used for cross validation, indicates broad agreement with our maize model under historical conditions. These validations confirm the optimal performance of the present model and the validity of the parameter values selected.
