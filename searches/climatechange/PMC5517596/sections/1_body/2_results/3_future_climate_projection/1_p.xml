<p id="Par25" class="p">The future scenarios project a loss of climatic suitability area for maize in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, but an expansion in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The following section describes the results for 2050. Both GCMs project similar trends for America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. For South America, a shift in climatic suitability can be observed, with previously medium areas changing to marginal suitability. In North America, an increase in areas of marginal suitability have also been projected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,c</xref>). Both GCMs project a loss of approximately 5% of general suitability in South America and an increase of approximately 10% in general suitability for North America (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In Africa, areas of climatic suitability for maize cultivation are projected to contract, with shifts from medium to marginal climate suitability in Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Congo (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,c</xref>). The CSIRO model indicates a reduction of 11% in areas with climatic suitability, with this figure at 7% in the MIROC model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In Asia, including the Middle East, climatic suitability for maize is projected to remain similar to current conditions. In India, marginal areas will become unsuitable, whereas in South East Asia, most medium suitability areas will change to marginal suitability by 2050. Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia will see a decrease in medium suitability areas and an increase in marginal suitability areas. An increase of 4% in climatically suitable areas for maize cultivation is projected under both GCMs for Asia, especially China (Fig.
