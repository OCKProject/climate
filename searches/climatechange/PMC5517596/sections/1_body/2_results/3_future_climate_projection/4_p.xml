<p id="Par28" class="p">By 2100, America, Europe and Oceania indicate some differences may occur between the two GCMs. Canada and the USA are projected to become more suitable for maize, with MIROC exhibiting larger increases in the south-eastern parts of Canada compared to CSIRO. Most Latin American countries are projected to experience a reduction in maize suitability, mainly in the optimal areas. Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Peru may preserve some optimal and medium suitability areas. Interestingly, Uruguay may remain as optimally suitable until 2100 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,d</xref>). Climatic suitability in North America is projected to increase by 19% and 20% under CSIRO and MIROC, respectively. South America is projected to decrease in suitability by 43% under both GCMs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). All of the European countries are projected to be suitable for maize to some extent. The MIROC model projects an important increase in optimal suitability in Scotland, England, France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Belarus and Russia. An increase in marginal suitability is expected for the Nordic countries and western Russia. CSIRO indicates a shift from marginal to medium suitability in northwestern Russia and in the Nordic countries, and an increase in the medium category in England and Italy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,d</xref>). The percentage change in these areas is similar under both GCMs, with 16% under CSIRO and 14% under MIROC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Finally, in Oceania, CSIRO predicts a three-times greater increase in unsuitable areas in Australia (30%) compared with MIROC (10%). New Zealand remains similar to current conditions (Fig.
