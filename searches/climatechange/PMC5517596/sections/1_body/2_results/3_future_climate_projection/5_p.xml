<p id="Par29" class="p">The stresses were mapped to visualise the changes from the current scenario to the future projections. Cold stress is projected to decrease poleward at a global scale. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the reduction in Europe and Asia. Heat stress may increase as a result of climate change, mainly in South America, Africa, parts of Asia and Australia. An illustration of the increase in heat stress is shown for Africa and some Asian countries in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Regarding dry stress, a worldwide increase is projected in accordance with a decrease in wet stress (Fig.
