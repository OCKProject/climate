<p id="Par27" class="p">Interestingly, Africa and Asia exhibited similar trends under both GCMs for 2100. For Africa, there is a considerable reduction in climatic suitability for maize. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique Central African Republic, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo and Nigeria may have small areas with marginal suitability remaining by the end of this century. Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Madagascar could be some of the few remaining African countries with medium and optimal suitability by 2100 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,d</xref>). Unsuitable areas will increase under CSIRO, with a 36% increment, compared to the 29% indicated under MIROC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In Asia, reductions in climatic suitability for maize cultivation are projected for India, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia. Mongolia and Southern Russia may become marginally suitable by 2100. Eastern China is projected to increase in optimal suitability, particularly under the MIROC scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,d</xref>). The increase in suitability is low for Asia, at 7% under CSIRO and 11% under MIROC (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
