<p id="Par26" class="p">In Australia, areas of marginal suitability are projected to decrease in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria under CSIRO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Larger decreases in areas with a medium climate for maize are projected under MIROC (5%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). For Europe, the modelled projections under the two GCMs indicated slight differences. MIROC projected larger increases in the medium category compared to CSIRO, with medium areas extending to Russia and an increase in optimal suitability for England, France, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Both GCMs projected a change from unsuitable to marginal suitability in the Nordic Countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,c</xref>). The projected percentage of change under CSIRO and MIROC is similar, with increases of 10%. However, CSIRO projected an increase in the marginal suitability category, whereas under MIROC the increase corresponds mostly to optimal areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
