<p id="Par31" class="p">Under current climate conditions, approximately 50% of the global area, with some degree of suitability for maize, falls into the territories of these five major producers. Argentina has a large area of optimal suitability, whereas Brazil has larger areas in the medium category. The three remaining countries have mainly marginal suitable areas for maize (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Under projected future climate conditions, a reduction in optimal areas in Argentina is indicated. In the 2050 scenario, Argentina will see a reduction in climate suitability for maize, but may recover some by 2100 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). It is projected that cold and dry stresses may decrease in Argentina by 2100, and heat stress is not projected to occur in Argentina. Brazil, between 2050 and 2100, may see a radical reduction in climate suitability, principally in the medium and optimal categories due to an increase of dry and heat stresses, even when wet stress is expected to decrease and no changes are expected in cold stress. South of the Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Sao Paulo remain as areas of optimal or medium suitability. A decrease of 64% in suitable areas is projected for Brazil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). China remains similar to current conditions in the 2050 scenario under both GCMs, with an approximately 5% increase in suitable areas. Under CSIRO for 2100, suitability in eastern China could increase by 13%, whereas under MIROC, this figure is as high as 20% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). For China, cold and wet stresses may decrease in future scenarios, whereas dry stress is projected to increase slightly. For Mexico, an increase of greater than 60% in unsuitable areas is projected by 2100 under both GCMs. Areas with medium suitability may be considerably reduced under future climate scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The USA exhibits a reduction in optimal areas, with an increase in areas in the medium category. Under CSIRO, a 16% increase in suitable climatic areas is projected for the USA, with MIROC indicating a more conservative increase of 9% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) In Mexico and the USA, cold and wet stresses are projected to decrease, contrary to heat and dry stresses, which will increase. Dry stress will cover almost the entire territory of Mexico by 2100, but only the western part of the USA. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> indicates the percentage of suitable areas for maize cultivation under the current scenario for the major five maize producers. The future scenarios indicate increases or decreases in this area for the major groups in relation to the current scenario.
