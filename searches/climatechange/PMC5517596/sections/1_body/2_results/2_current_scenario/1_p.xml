<p id="Par24" class="p">The modelled results indicate medium to optimal climatic suitability for the eastern United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, some other South American countries, Central and Southern Africa, most of Europe, Southern India, Eastern China and the Australian coasts. The Sahara Desert, central Australia, most of Canada, Mongolia and a large part of Russia are among the countries or territories with unsuitable conditions. The current modelled projection results show that over 60% of the African continent has some degree of climatic suitability for maize, compared with 77% of South America. Europe was projected to have the largest area of climatic suitability for maize cultivation, with almost 82% coverage (TableÂ
