<p id="Par36" class="p">Even where the areas of climatic suitability estimated for the current conditions in this research match the known distribution, the CLIMEX maize model differs from other projections. The EcoCrop mechanistic model projects higher maize suitability in Africa, Australia and India and lower suitability in the Maize Belt of the USA, Europe and China under current conditions

 </sup>. This may be because the EcoCrop temperature thresholds differ from those used in this research. For example, the EcoCrop maximum temperature was set at 47 °C, whereas in this study, a value of 35 °C was used. This difference may be a result of the high level of biological diversity and climatic requirements of maize

 </sup> and of the model choice; for example, the Maize Belt of the USA has an average temperature between 26 to 34 °C, whereas in Ethiopia, Mexico and the Andean zone, the range is between 18 to 24 °C

 </sup>. Furthermore, the EcoCrop niche projection for the USA does not predict high suitability in the Maize Belt of the USA; however, this region produces more than 30% of the world’s maize yield, mainly under rainfed conditions
