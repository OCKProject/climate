<p id="Par42" class="p">Recently, in the AR5 report, the IPCC adopted representative concentration pathways (RCP) to replace the SRES. Moreover, new general circulation models (GCMs), such as the Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3), MIROC3.2, CNRM-CM3, CSIRO Mark 3.0, CM2.0-AOGCM, FGOALS1.0_g, INMCM3.0, Parallel Climate Model (PCM) and HadCM3 are becoming available. The new data from the RCPs can be used in various correlative species distribution models, such as MaxEnt, the Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest and Boosted Regression Trees; however, the available data for CLIMEX are only from two SRES (A1B and A2) and two GCMs (CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H).
