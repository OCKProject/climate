<p id="Par43" class="p">We would also like to note that the CLIMEX model does not incorporate certain limiting abiotic and biotic factors, such as soil type, pests, pest interactions and weed impacts. Thus, one criticism of this study is that estimates of technical feasibility fail to identify the areas where it would be economically desirable to cultivate the species. Inclusion of non-climatic factors, such as topography, soil taxonomy, physicochemical properties of soil, and land usage on the national level, are required and could be included in future studies of maize suitability projections, either at global or regional levels. Furthermore, in the present study, the potential genetic progress of the species was not taken into account.</p>
