<p id="Par33" class="p">This study was based on the biological and climatic requirements that cover all of the maize mega-environments. Taking into account these requirements, the model provides a good fit with the current global distribution of maize, including the validation area, which provided data that was not used to determine the bioclimatic requirements (India, China and neighbouring countries) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In this study, the model represented approximately 96% of the occurrence records worldwide during the calibration phase and 88% of the occurrence records within the validation area matching the suitable areas for maize cultivation estimated using CLIMEX modelling.
