 </sup>. At the global level, the results of this research indicate a significant reduction in climatic suitability for maize cultivation in developing countries and expanded or greater suitability for some developed countries (USA, Canada, Europe and Australia). These previous results indicate comparative agreement with increases in heat stress over Africa and dry stress in Latin America, as noted in the projections in this study. Moderately higher temperatures, shortening of the growing cycle resulting in reduced dry matter in grain maize, and the increase in heat stress and dry stress are likely to be responsible for reduced yields and degraded climate suitability
