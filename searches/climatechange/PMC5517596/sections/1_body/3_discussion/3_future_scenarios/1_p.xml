 </sup>. These findings agree with the results of the present study, which indicate the expansion of climatic suitability for maize in cooler regions (northern latitudes) such as North America and Northern Europe, in agreement with a reduction in cold stress in future scenarios, under both GCMs for these regions. Currently, maize does not have optimal conditions in Northern Europe, but despite climate constraints, it has become established as a competitive crop in countries such as Denmark

 </sup>. The Nordic countries started to cultivate maize mainly for silage, due to the short growing season and the low temperature limits for grain production. These countries are projected to increase maize cultivation into more northern latitudes as a result of the use of new hybrids and/or the climate change impacts

 </sup>. This change in suitability may increase the competitiveness of maize in cooler regions and may create conditions for grain production, not only silage.
