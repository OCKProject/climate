<p id="Par38" class="p">The CERES (Crop Environment Resource Synthesis) crop model predicts a reduction in production of almost 12 million tons per year; representing 10% of the current production of Latin American and African countries by 2055, using data based on four maize varieties in rainfed conditions

 </sup>. Such a prediction bears a direct relationship to the results of the present study in terms of the projected reduction of suitability in Latin America and Africa. Though production yields were not estimated in the present study, the level of climatic suitability is directly related to changes in maize production. Another study, using the SRES and HadCM3 GCM, with production functions that incorporate temperature, precipitation and the response to CO
