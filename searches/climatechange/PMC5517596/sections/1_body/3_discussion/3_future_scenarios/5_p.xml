<p id="Par41" class="p">This future global scenario has important implications for food security in developing countries. However, development of new technologies and management adaptation could mitigate the impact of climate change on maize cultivation. For example, the development of stress tolerant varieties can reduce losses due to heat, drought, frost and hail in areas where conditions become unfavourable
