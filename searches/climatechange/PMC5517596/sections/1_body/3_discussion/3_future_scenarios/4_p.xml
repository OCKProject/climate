 </sup>. The present model projects an increase of up to 16% in climatic suitability for maize in the USA, and China is also projected to have increased climate suitability. In China, maize is one of the major crops and is grown over an extended range of climatic conditions, from cold temperate to sub-tropical. During recent decades, there has been a tendency to increase the sown area and consequently the production yield in China

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>
 </sup>. The more productive regions in China and the USA are those projected to increase in suitability, as shown by the present results. In contrast, our results indicate a reduction in areas of climatic suitability for maize in Brazil and Mexico. Some researchers have suggested that the availability of agricultural areas will be reduced due to climate change in northeastern Brazil and, as a consequence, productivity could be reduced

 </sup>. By 2050, a 30% reduction in maize production is predicted for Brazil

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>
 </sup>; the present study projects a reduction of climate suitability of 5% by 2050 and a dramatic increase by the end of the century to 64%. Similarly, reports from Mexico suggest a reduction in rain-fed maize production and areas suitable for its cultivation

 </sup>. Travasso 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., (2009) modelled maize production in Argentina with the regional model MM5/CIMA and predicted increases in yield with the inclusion of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects, whereas without the inclusion of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects the production would reduce by 9% under SRES A2.
