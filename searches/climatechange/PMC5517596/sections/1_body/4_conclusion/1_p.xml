<p id="Par44" class="p">This study assessed the potential impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on climate suitability for maize cultivation, and consequently its distribution around the world. The use of CLIMEX allowed for a deeper understanding of the stress factors reducing the climate suitability of a species under future scenarios. Moreover, the high percentage of records in the validation area, as well as the sensitivity analysis, reduced the uncertainty in the CLIMEX model. Our main findings indicate that areas of climatic suitability for maize production are projected to increase in many developed countries (poleward areas), such as the USA, which is a major production area, due to a reduction in cold stress, whereas reductions in suitability are projected mainly for developing countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, which are two important production areas, and in many African countries, due to an increase in heat and dry stresses. Millions of people in Africa and Latin America depend on maize as their staple crop. Smallholders in these countries, as well as a portion of the population they feed, may be affected by the reduction in maize suitability, jeopardizing food security. The USA and China, two of the main maize producers (60%), are likely to see an increase in areas suitable for maize cultivation. This study indicate that heat and dry stresses may limit maize suitability in the future for countries between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; however, agricultural research and the genetics of plant cultivars could mitigate some of the negative effects of climate change for maize with new varieties that are tolerant to heat and drought conditions.</p>
