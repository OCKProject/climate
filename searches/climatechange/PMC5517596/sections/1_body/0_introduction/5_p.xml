<p id="Par6" class="p">The objectives of this research were as follows: (i) to employ CLIMEX as a mechanistic species distribution model to assess potential changes in the global distribution of agricultural land for maize cultivation based on shifts in climatic suitability for current versus two time periods, 2050 and 2100 according to projections from two general circulation models (GCMs) CSIRO Mk3.0 and MIROC-H and assuming the A2 emissions scenario; (ii) to identify current maize cultivation regions that are likely to be severely impacted as a consequence of climate change and to identify future stresses; and (iii) to perform a sensitivity analysis to quantify species response to temperature, soil moisture and cold stress changes and to identify the parameters of functional importance to provide a greater understanding of the climatic factors that most impact species distribution.</p>
