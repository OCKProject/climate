<p id="Par5" class="p">To assess the potential changes in global maize distribution due to climate change, an appropriate modelling technique should be applied. There are close to one hundred mechanistic and crop niche models that can simulate the potential consequences of climate change on crop production and species distributions. These models differ in their input parameters, protocols and methods

 </sup>. Some widely used distribution models include the following: EcoCrop, which is a mechanistic model that integrates the FAO-EcoCrop database and uses temperature, rainfall and length of the growing season as inputs

 </sup>; MaxEnt, which is an empirical approach that models the potential distributions of species based on presence information of the species of interest

 </sup>; and CLIMEX, which is a hybrid statistical-mechanistic model that is used to estimate the potential abundance and geographic distribution of an organism using climatic data and biological parameters

 </sup>. CLIMEX has been widely used to model the suitability of a variety of organisms, from weeds to insects, at global and regional levels, providing important insights into the ecology of a species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. An important insight available in CLIMEX is the daily or weekly species’ response to climate variables. Furthermore, the model allows us to explore abiotic constraints, such as heat, cold, dry and moisture stresses
