Herbarium specimens are also collected over a greater period of time from a larger geographical area while field data are often from specific localities over a shorter time period (

Despite criticisms, herbarium specimen data have been shown to produce similar enough results to field data that herbarium specimen data are now widely accepted in phenological studies.
