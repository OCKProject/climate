<p class="p">An early study by 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Borchert (1996)</xref> found that herbarium specimen data produced slightly longer flowering durations than field data, but noted that durations were mostly similar overall. 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Borchert (1996)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rivera &amp; Borchert (2001)</xref> found phenology data from field sites largely overlapped that of herbarium specimens with only slight differences. The negligible differences between herbarium specimen data and field data in these studies helped justify the use of herbarium specimen data to analyze phenology in more recent studies. Nevertheless, several more recent studies specifically compared phenology estimates from field data to those made from herbarium specimens.
