 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bolmgren &amp; Lonnberg (2005)</xref> compared herbarium specimen data directly to field data and found the two data sets were overall highly correlated with only minor differences. For example, herbarium specimens showed a slightly earlier mean flowering for spring-flowering plants than field data, but the difference was not significant (

 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al. (2015)</xref> also primarily focused on testing the validity of using herbarium specimen data. 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robbirt et al. (2011)</xref> used a principal axis regression analysis to compare herbarium derived peak-flowering dates with field derived peak-flowering dates and found a high degree of correlation. 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robbirt et al. (2011)</xref> discussed how the high degree of correlation between herbarium and field data also supports the notion that geographically different records will not significantly alter the robustness of either data set. A study by 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al. (2015)</xref> used a paired

 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al. (2015)</xref> concluded that both specimen and field data could be combined and used as a whole.
