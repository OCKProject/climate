<p class="p">Larger sample sizes may be required if phenology varies across a speciesâ€™ geographic range. In order to analyze species distributions using herbarium specimens, 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Proosdij et al. (2016)</xref> found that the minimum number of herbarium specimens sampled should be between 14 and 25 depending on the geographical range of the species. The 
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Proosdij et al. (2016)</xref> study used simulated species to assess the minimum herbarium samples required for acceptable model performance in both virtual and real study areas. Some species with narrow geographical ranges could be modeled with as few as 14 herbarium records while wide ranging species could be satisfactorily modeled with a minimum of 25 records (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Proosdij et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these studies, we recommend caution when interpreting results from samples sizes with fewer than 30 records (
