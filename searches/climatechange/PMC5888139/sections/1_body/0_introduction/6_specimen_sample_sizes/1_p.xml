<p class="p">Sample size, or the number of specimens used per species, varied across studies (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The minimum number of specimens used per species was occasionally as low as two or three records (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Searcy, 2012</xref>). Some studies using herbarium data have set a minimum number of herbarium specimens per species or a minimum time range for collections in order to more accurately estimate phenologies and change over time. 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis (2013)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallagher, Hughes &amp; Leishman (2009)</xref> set a minimum of 10 specimens in order to meet statistical assumptions of different models. 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moln√°r et al. (2012)</xref> eliminated a species from analyses because collections only yielded dates across an eight year time span. 
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park &amp; Schwartz (2015)</xref> eliminated species with records that spanned less than three years. 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Neil, Landrum &amp; Wu (2010)</xref> organized species into functional groups (spring ephemerals, spring shrubs, fall ephemerals, winter-spring ephemerals, and winter-spring shrubs) in order to overcome the problem of low sample sizes for each species but found that responses of individual species varied greatly within functional groups.
