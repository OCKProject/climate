<p class="p">Studies in temperate regions have used varying methods to determine flowering status for species with long flowering durations. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Molnár et al. (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bertin (2015)</xref> excluded species that flowered outside of the peak flowering season of the region, defined as the period from late-spring to early-summer. 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Molnár et al. (2012)</xref> removed one species because its peak flowering date was in September and focused on 40 other taxa that had flowering peaks from in spring and early-summer. The excluded species was a strong outlier and it was suggested that autumn climate events may affect species differently than spring climate events (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Molnár et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park (2012)</xref> also removed outlier records when flowering records fell outside the peak regional flowering season. Flowering records before Julian day 45 and after Julian day 310 were removed from analyses to reduce biases caused by winter flowering species. Additionally, 
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park (2012)</xref> removed records that were 150 days after the median flowering date for each species to reduce errors caused by any second flowerings that can happen in autumn months. Several other studies removed taxa with long flowering durations to reduce variance among species. 
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bertin (2015)</xref> excluded native weedy species with flowering durations from spring to fall. 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallagher, Hughes &amp; Leishman (2009)</xref> only used species with a flowering duration of less than three months. 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Panchen et al. (2012)</xref> chose to use only species with clear beginning and ending points to investigate long and short flowering duration. 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Panchen et al. (2012)</xref> found that plants with shorter flowering durations required smaller sample sizes to produce significant results when regressing flowering day on year.
