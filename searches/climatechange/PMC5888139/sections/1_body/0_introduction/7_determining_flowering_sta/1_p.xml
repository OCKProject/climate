<p class="p">Some studies have simply recorded the presence or absence of flowers from herbarium specimens as an indicator of flowering, but other studies have used more detailed criteria to assess flowering status on specimens. 
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haggerty, Hove &amp; Mazer (2012)</xref> provided a primer to assist researchers with collecting data from herbarium specimens. 
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haggerty, Hove &amp; Mazer (2012)</xref> suggested researchers assign a phenophase for each specimen, such as pre-flowering, first-flowering or peak flowering. 
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haggerty, Hove &amp; Mazer (2012)</xref> also noted that researchers must assume the stem on the herbarium sheet represents the flowering phenophase for the entire plant. Past studies, such as 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diskin et al. (2012)</xref>, have used a scoring system from 1 to 5 to categorize phenophase stages raging from “no flowers” to “end of fruiting” on each specimen. 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diskin et al. (2012)</xref> categorized flowering as 50% of buds open on the specimen. 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis (2013)</xref> also categorized flowering as 50% of flower buds in anthesis to ensure that the samples were in peak flowering. For a species with an inflorescence, 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al. (2015)</xref> only counted specimens as flowering if greater than 75% of flowers were open. Standardization of phenological terms remains a core challenge of mining phenological data (
