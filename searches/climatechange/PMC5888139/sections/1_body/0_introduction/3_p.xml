<p class="p">An early criticism of using herbarium specimens was that plant parts preserved as herbarium specimens might not have been collected during their peak flowering season, potentially biasing interpretations (

 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Daru, Van der Bank &amp; Davies (2017)</xref> concluded that while some of these biases can be accounted for using statistical approaches, future herbarium collections should focus on filling large gaps in the data. Other studies have found that large sample sizes afforded by herbarium specimens, and the use of mean flowering times (mean of Julian dates), could yield valid inferences, even if specimens were not collected at the time of peak flowering (
