<p class="p">Future studies of phenology could benefit from such geo-referencing methods because several phenology studies only included data from specimens with GPS coordinates. Studies using GPS data are able to account for climate variation with higher resolution, although accuracy still depends on the underlying empirical data and modeling approach used to generate GIS climate layers.</p>
