<p class="p">Among species that have broad geographic ranges, differences in climate in different parts of the species’ range can complicate attempts to correlate a species’ flowering day with temperature. Several methods have been used to account for climate variability across a species’ range. An early study by

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in Quebec, Canada. Temperature data from 88 meteorological stations were averaged together across this range. To account for early snow cover melt in the southern part of this range, flowering dates from individuals in southern locations were normalized with individuals in northern locations by subtracting extra periods of snow cover from individuals in the north. The adjusted dates indicated flowering occurred 33 days earlier over the last century while original (unadjusted) dates indicated flowering occurred 19 days earlier over the last century.
