<p class="p">In order to more accurately estimate temperature averages across a region, recent studies have used Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to project finer-scale climate layers across a region and extract temperature data from specific Global Positioning System (GPS) points. 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallagher, Hughes &amp; Leishman (2009)</xref> referenced GPS locations for each specimen and extracted the temperature averages at specimen GPS points from a gridded map of temperature averages across Australia (âˆ¼5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> resolution). 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hereford, Schmitt &amp; Ackerly (2017)</xref> also extracted climate data from 176 collection locations in order to analyze species distributions and phenology. 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rawal et al. (2015)</xref> used the nearest data point from gridded climate averages across Victoria, Australia. 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Edwards &amp; Still (2008)</xref> analyzed the climate envelopes of grasses by assigning GPS points to herbarium specimen locations in order to extract temperature averages from gridded climate maps (250 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> resolution). 
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kosanic et al. (2018)</xref> manually geo-referenced locations using herbarium specimen localities and provided a methodology for assigning GPS coordinates when analyzing species distributions and phenology. Standardizing methods for geo-referencing localities of herbarium records without GPS coordinates could allow for more specimen data and larger sample sizes. 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bloom, Flower &amp; DeChaine (2018)</xref> developed a comprehensive protocol for standardizing spatial accuracy of geo-referenced specimen localities for species distributions.
