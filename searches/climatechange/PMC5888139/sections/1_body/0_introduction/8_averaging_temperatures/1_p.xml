<p class="p">The foundational study by 
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Primack et al. (2004)</xref> examined temperature averages from three calendar months prior to the specimen flowering date, with the assumption that flowering date is a function of temperatures experienced in past months. Field investigations such as 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fitter et al. (1995)</xref> have shown temperature averages from different sets of months preceding flowering affected flowering phenology in different ways. More recently, 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis (2013)</xref> chose to regress the month of flowering with temperature averages from each of the eleven months prior to flowering. They found that temperature averages from three months prior to the date of flowering showed the strongest correlations with flowering (

 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robbirt et al. (2011)</xref> investigated three sets of temperature averages over three month intervals and also found that three months prior to flowering had the most predictive power. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rawal et al. (2015)</xref> regressed flowering on temperature averages for each species from 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months prior to flowering, because responses can vary by species. 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rawal et al. (2015)</xref> also found that mean temperatures three months prior had the greatest influence on flowering time for all species.
