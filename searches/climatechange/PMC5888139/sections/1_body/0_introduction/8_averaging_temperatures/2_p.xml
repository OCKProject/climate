<p class="p">Other studies have used average temperatures from spring months because spring temperatures generally have the most predictive power for flowering date (

 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bertin (2015)</xref> found an interesting trend that supported the effect of spring temperatures: the earlier a species’ mean flowering time occurred in the spring, the more the species’ mean dates had shifted toward an earlier day of year over time. 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robbirt et al. (2011)</xref> also found the highest correlations of flowering day with spring temperature averages across March, April and May. 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis (2013)</xref> found significant changes in flowering in response to average spring temperatures (February–May) but not in response to summer temperatures (June–September). 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gaira, Dhar &amp; Belwal (2011)</xref> found the highest correlations between flowering and temperatures in earlier months from December–February in a Himalayan perennial. As an alternative to using mean monthly temperatures, 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diskin et al. (2012)</xref> investigated the averages of temperature anomalies, or deviations from the overall long-term mean, for 2, 3, and 6 month periods from January to June and found averages from six months prior to flowering had the strongest correlations. 
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park (2014)</xref> used temperature averages across three month periods from early spring to late summer and found a similar trend. Temperature averages were organized into early, mid, and late seasonal classes within the months of February–October. 
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park (2014)</xref> found warming temperatures had affected species in the early spring class more than other classes. 
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park &amp; Schwartz (2015)</xref> also used early, mid and late seasonal classes for spring and summer and found that mid-season phenology events should be modeled differently than early or late season events. 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hart et al. (2014)</xref> used annual temperatures and temperatures from each season (spring, summer, fall, and winter) and found significant correlations for annual and fall temperature averages, but with opposite effects. 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hart et al. (2014)</xref> discussed that warmer fall temperatures may delay the chilling requirement for 
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron</italic> species, resulting in a delay in flowering while warmer annual temperatures will lead to advances in flowering overall. Other studies found annual temperature means were as useful as spring temperatures. 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al. (2015)</xref> found similar results between spring and annual temperature averages and used annual averages in analyses. 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallagher, Hughes &amp; Leishman (2009)</xref> also used annual temperature means for analyses and explained that seasonal means were correlated with annual means.
