<p class="p">We recommend investigating the effect of temperature by analyzing averages from multiple sets of months prior to flowering for each species rather than using only one fixed spring interval or only annual temperatures (

 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis, 2013</xref>). Caution should be taken when analyzing temperature averages from the same months prior to flowering for all species when flowering month varies by species. For example, when analyzing the effect of temperature averages from three months prior for all species, 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calinger, Queenborough &amp; Curtis (2013)</xref> found that for many species, flowering was correlated with temperatures three months earlier, yet for species with an earlier mean flowering day in April, January temperatures (three months prior to flowering) did not predict flowering date; instead, temperature averages from the months of February, March and April were better predictors for those species.
