<p class="p">Between 2015 and 2017, we compiled and reviewed studies that used herbarium specimens to assess climate change and flowering phenology. We searched Web of Science (1900—present), JSTOR (1665—present) and Google Scholar for studies containing the terms herbarium, specimen, phenology, and climate change. The methods of each study were reviewed for; sample size, determining flowering status of specimens, approach to determining temperatures, geographic variation, and any validations of the use of herbarium specimens (e.g., comparisons to field observations). Studies and methods were then categorized and a synthesis of each category is discussed; sample sizes and regression methods were also summarized (
