<p class="p">The use of herbarium specimens for the investigation of flowering phenology has grown considerably during the past decade. As efforts to produce digital copies of specimens and label information have amassed large datasets, new approaches for analyzing responses to climate change are rapidly becoming available. Although small sample sizes have often been used in early studies of phenology, various factors, such as wide geographic range, may require larger sample sizes. Based on recent validations, estimations of mean-flowering should be used rather than first-flowering because estimates of first-flowering are more sensitive to sampling. Statistically modeling the start of the flowering process appears to be another promising approach to investigating how climate change has affected the beginning of a flowering cycle (

GPS point data allow for correspondence with higher resolution temperature data in climatically diverse geographical regions. Studies using herbarium specimen data will continue to help us understand the impact of recent climate change on plant reproductive phenology. Other aspects of plant phenology that can be analyzed using herbarium specimens, such as fruit ripening and spring leaf emergence, have important implications for higher trophic levels, which may include rare animals dependent on plant resources (

Future studies investigating phylogenetic signals and plasticity are needed to further improve our understanding of adaptation and resilience to climate change. As temperatures continue to rise globally, herbarium specimens will continue to be crucial resources for analyzing phenological responses to climate change.
