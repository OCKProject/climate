<p class="p">Ecological niche modelling has emerged in recent years as a key method for predicting the potential distribution of a species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Ecological niche models have already been constructed for several sand fly species in parts of Latin America, with or without predictions based on climate-change scenarios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Ecological niche modelling on a continental scale has only been reported for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] because of the earlier paucity of verified presence records for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic>. A published niche model of 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> is restricted to north-west Argentina because it is based on field-collected data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, datasets and methods are frequently being improved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], and the present report is the first to investigate how differences in the fundamental ecological niches of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> could affect their future distributions throughout South America.
