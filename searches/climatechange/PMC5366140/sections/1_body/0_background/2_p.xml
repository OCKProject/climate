<p class="p">Before 1996, 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> was usually treated as a junior synonym of the morphologically similar 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>], which has long been considered an important vector of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania braziliens</italic>is, the causative agent of much cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in South America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Both sand fly species are now incriminated vectors of 
 <italic class="italic">L. braziliensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>] in different regions, such as 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> in south-east Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> in south Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>] and Argentina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, many earlier records do not permit the differentiation between the two species and previous authors have not recognised them as separate species. In those cases, we refer here to 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">sensu lato</italic>). The females of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> are opportunistic blood feeders, feeding on domestic animals, rodents and humans alike, and can be found in both forests and anthropic environments in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil or Paraguay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Distinguishing between 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> is important because any differences in their habitat preferences, adaptations to deforestation and urbanisation, biting preferences and vectorial capacities could influence which areas are at risk of leishmaniasis transmission [
