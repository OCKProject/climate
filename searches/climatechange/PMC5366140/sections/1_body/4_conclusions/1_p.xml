<p class="p">Our findings indicate that climate change will not always lead to the expansion of the geographical distribution of disease vectors such as sand flies. 
 <italic class="italic">Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> will have smaller areas of climatic suitability available to them in the future, but they might disperse into new areas, such as southwards into Brazil and Argentina (
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic>) and within northeast Brazil (
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic>). Ecological niche models should be species specific, carefully selected and combined in an ensemble approach.
