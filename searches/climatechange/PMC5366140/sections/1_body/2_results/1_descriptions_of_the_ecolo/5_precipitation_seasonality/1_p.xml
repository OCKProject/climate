<p class="p">Mean temperature seasonality, but not mean precipitation seasonality, was statistically much higher for 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> than for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic>, with only the former occurring where temperature seasonality shows &gt; 35 standard deviations. For 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai,</italic> precipitation seasonality displays a positive quadratic distribution with temperature seasonality &gt; 10 standard deviations (all but one record) (Fig.
