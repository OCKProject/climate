<p class="p">For all ecological niche modelling algorithms, each climate change scenario predicted modifications in the distributions of the climatic conditions suitable for both sand fly species within the four countries where they currently occur, namely Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Uncertainty mapping showed the least confidence in current and future predictions for
