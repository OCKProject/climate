<p class="p">Using the consensus for the five ecological niche modelling algorithms, both climate change scenarios indicated different patterns of range stability, contraction or expansion for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). For 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> the predictions were for substantial contraction in the southern part of its range, where uncertainty mapping lent confidence to the predictions; and any expansion was limited to small areas in the northern part of its range, where uncertainty mapping suggested moderate-high confidence in the predictions. In contrast, for 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> the predictions were for a large range shift southwards, and uncertainty mapping lent confidence to the predictions.
