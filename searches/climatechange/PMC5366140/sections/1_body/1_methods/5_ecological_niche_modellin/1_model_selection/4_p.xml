<p class="p">The algorithm GARP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] was used to model the ecological niche of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic> (
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.)Â to help compare our findings with those of Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. GARP is a genetic algorithm based on a series of classificatory rules that are developed according to relationships between predictive variables and species occurrences. The various rules 'evolve' in a process analogous to natural selection, and they are excluded or selected to maximise predictability [
