<p class="p">There are numerous approaches to ecological niche modelling, with each algorithm producing a different predictive result and map. The choice of algorithms will depend in part on the availability of presence data alone, presence and background data (the environment across the entire study area), or both presence and absence data. However, there is no single approach that is consistently considered superior to all others, as discussed by Ara√∫jo et al. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] and Beaumont et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] in relation to predicting species distributions under climate change. Therefore, to overcome the limitations of each algorithm when used in isolation, five modelling algorithms were applied: BIOCLIM, Generalised Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forests (RANFOR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
