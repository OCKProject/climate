<p class="p">BIOCLIM is classified as a ‘profile’ modelling method, i.e. it only considers species presence data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. It works by computing the similarity of environmental variables at known locations of species occurrence to the value of those variables at locations where the species has not been observed, to identify potentially climatically suitable environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. GLMs are a form of regression model. In this method, the dependent variable is transformed relative to its mean value, and the relationship between the transformed variable and a set of predictor variables assessed to forecast climatically suitable environments for a species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Logistic regression was utilised for this study because it is the most popular form of GLM for ecological niche modelling and adequate for presence/absence data.
