<p class="p">MaxEnt, RANFOR and SVM are all machine learning models that consider both presence and absence or presence and background data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. MaxEnt computes a probable distribution within the study area that satisfies constraints derived from the environmental conditions at current presence locations. It then selects an area that has maximum entropy within the specified distribution area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. RANFOR is a classification tree-based modelling method that works by dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups based on the value of predictor variables and describing each subset resulting from these splits according to their homogeneity in the response variable through a sum of squares [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. SVM models estimate the current and future fundamental niche of a species by fitting a hyperplane to separate presence and absence data, and applying a linear analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Among machine learning and other modelling algorithms, MaxEnt models have consistently performed well in comparative and validation studies when used to predict habitat changes due to climate change [
