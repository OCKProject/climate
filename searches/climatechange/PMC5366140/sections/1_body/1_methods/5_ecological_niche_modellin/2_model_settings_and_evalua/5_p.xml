<p class="p">Only model outputs with TSS scores above or equal to 0.7 were retained for mapping the climatic suitability areas of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic>. Outputs with the highest TSS scores from each algorithm were overlaid and areas of agreement extracted per the majority ensemble rule [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], to produce binary ensemble maps. These were validated by TSS using the set of presence records that was left out of the modelling procedures during the spatial thinning process (see above). Potential changes in the climatic suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> were assessed from these maps.
