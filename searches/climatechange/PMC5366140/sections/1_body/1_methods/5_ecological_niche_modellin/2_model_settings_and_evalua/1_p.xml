 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] under default settings, except for GARP models that were run in OpenModeller (version 1.1.0), using its 'Best Subsets' implementation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. For every modelling algorithm, 10-fold cross-validation was applied, to use the whole set of presence/pseudo-absence records for both model training and testing. In each model run, 10% of records were randomly selected for model testing. 60 model runs were performed; 10 runs for each of the six algorithms.
