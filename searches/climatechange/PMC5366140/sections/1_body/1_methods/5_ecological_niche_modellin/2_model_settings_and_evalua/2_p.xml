<p class="p">The model outputs were mapped as continuous values per pixel representing climate suitability. The standard deviation of each pixel was used to compare results from different algorithms and map uncertainty. As the range of values is different for each algorithm, outputs were converted to binary (0 and 1) by applying a sensitivity and specificity maximisation threshold, and maps were inspected for areas of disagreement. This threshold rule was chosen because it is objective, minimises both false positives and false negatives, and has been found to perform well in ecological niche models assessing the effects of climate change [
