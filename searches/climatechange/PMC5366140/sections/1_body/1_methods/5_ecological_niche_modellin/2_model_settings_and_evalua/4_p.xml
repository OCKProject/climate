<p class="p">The performance of each model was evaluated by the true skill statistic (TSS), a derivative of Cohenâ€™s kappa. While kappa alone is a popular measure of model performance, recent studies suggest that it is overly dependent on presence data, and equal proportions of presences and absences only contribute to the kappa score when sensitivity and specificity are uniform, which biases estimates of predictive accuracy [
