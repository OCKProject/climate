<p class="p">Presence records gathered from sources prior to 1996 were cross-referenced with the major reviews of Marcondes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] and Andrade-Filho et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>], to check for any inconsistencies in the identifications of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic>, which were reclassified when necessary. All presence records were plotted on a map of South America using ArcGIS v. 10.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] to identify potential outliers. If a record appeared to fall outside the distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> described by the two major reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>], the original paper was consulted to assess the accuracy of the database entry and the taxonomic expertise of the identifier. The authors were then contacted for verification, and expert opinion was sought from those listed in the previous section.
