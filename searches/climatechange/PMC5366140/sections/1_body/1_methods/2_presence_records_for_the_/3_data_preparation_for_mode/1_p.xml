<p class="p">Presence records from secondary data tend to be spatially biased; therefore, the datasets were refined to reduce spatial autocorrelation. A spatial thinning process was applied with R package 
 <italic class="italic">spThin</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], to randomly select a subset of records for which each neighbouring pair was at least 10Â km apart. The remaining data was retained for independent validation of the models.
