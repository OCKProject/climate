<p class="p">Pseudo-absences were sampled outside the environmental domain favourable for the species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], with the latter estimated using the simple bioclimatic envelope model BIOCLIM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. The number of pseudo-absences was the same as the number of presence records for each species.
