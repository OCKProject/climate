<p class="p">The approximate area of climatic suitability was extracted from the final binary ensemble maps of each species under each scenario (current, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), to give an objective numerical overview of potential climatic habitat contraction and expansion. Binary model predictions from each scenario were overlapped in ArcGIS v. 10.00 [
