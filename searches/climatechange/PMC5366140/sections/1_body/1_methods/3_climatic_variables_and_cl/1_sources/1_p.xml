<p class="p">Historical (1960–1990) climate data for South America was sourced from WorldClim, an online database of 19 climatic variables derived from monthly averages of temperature and precipitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Also sourced from WorldClim were climate projections for 2050 (average for 2041–2060) under different scenarios based on the different RCPs underlying the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report models. Each of the RCPs is based on potential increases in total radiative forcing (defined as the ‘cumulative measure of human emissions of [greenhouse gases] from all sources expressed in Watts per square meter’), simulated in integrated assessment models to 2100 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were chosen because they represent contrasting greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. RCP4.5 is a stabilisation scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. It assumes growth in the greenhouse gas emissions trajectory is limited through initiatives including carbon capture and storage, the development of low emissions energy technologies, and the introduction of global greenhouse gas emissions pricing. RCP8.5 corresponds to the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the RCP collection. It is a ‘business as usual’ scenario, in which no climate-specific mitigation targets or policies are set, population growth is high, and only modest improvements in energy-use intensity and technology change are experienced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. It does assume a slight reduction in emissions intensity from the 2010 baseline after 2030.
