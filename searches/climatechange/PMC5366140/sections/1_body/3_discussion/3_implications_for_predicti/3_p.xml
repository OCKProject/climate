<p class="p">Our models indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> will become more tropical, while 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> will shift southwards and become more subtropical. This contradicts the suggestion that 
 <italic class="italic">L. whitmani</italic> might replace 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.) as the more important vector of 
 <italic class="italic">L. braziliensis</italic> in southern Brazil and nearby Argentina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Currently, 
 <italic class="italic">L. whitmani</italic> is likely to share transmission of CL with 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> only in the south-east region of Brazil, such as in Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In fact, there is no evidence in the past 13 years that 
 <italic class="italic">L. whitmani</italic> has spread into the far south of Brazil, where 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> is the only reported vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. Our results agree with the previous niche model of 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> produced by Maxent for north-west Argentina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. In Argentina, 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> is the most abundant sand fly species in CL transmission areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>], and modelling predicts it will persist there in the future.
