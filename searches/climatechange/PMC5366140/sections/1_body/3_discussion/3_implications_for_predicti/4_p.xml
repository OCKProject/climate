<p class="p">In northeast Brazil, the models predict a future increase in climatic suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> mainly in central Piauí state. This is a region of transition between the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, which are substantially drier and warmer than the Atlantic Forest where 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> currently occurs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. This region is poorly sampled for sand flies. However, captures performed in the late 1990s detected only 
 <italic class="italic">L. longipalpis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. whitmani</italic> as potential vector species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. There is a single record of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> in Piauí State, in the capital Teresina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Future field studies should survey this area for the occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and other potential vectors.
