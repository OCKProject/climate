<p class="p">The shifting distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> in response to climate change will affect regional investigations of transmission cycles, including those using overlaid ecological niche models of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> and its vectors in south-east Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Because climate is a first order determinant of the spatial distribution of species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>], predictive models at finer spatial scales are needed to guide more precise assessments of disease risk and surveillance. These models will require the inclusion of environmental variables at higher resolution, including land cover as well as climate.
