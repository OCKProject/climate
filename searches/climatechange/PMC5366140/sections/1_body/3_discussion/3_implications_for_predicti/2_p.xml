<p class="p">The intersection map (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) shows that the range overlap between the two sand fly species in south-eastern Brazil will decrease substantially under both climate change scenarios. Currently, both species occur in sympatry mainly in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Both species have been found in the Ribeira Valley, a CL endemic area in São Paulo, although substantial local variations in their densities have been reported: At Parque Estadual do Alto Ribeira (PETAR), an Atlantic forest reserve, their low densities suggested a minimum risk of disease transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]; while in the nearby Serra district, where visiting tourists to PETAR stay, 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> had such high frequencies that their presence in peridomestic areas suggested a high risk of CL transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. In Corinto and Lassance (Minas Gerais), the two species represented 97% of the captured sand flies and were suggested as local vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. The role of both species as CL vectors in sympatric areas thus might depend on local variations in population density determined by other environmental variables besides climate. Man-made environmental impacts such as deforestation might favour the selection of sand fly species that can survive in these areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. This was clear in the studies mentioned above in Ribeira Valley, where although forest and anthropic areas have very similar phlebotomine faunas, the frequency of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> was considerably higher in anthropic areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Similar findings were observed in an ecotourism area of Rio de Janeiro, where 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> predominated in peridomestic areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. Climate may thus constrain the distribution of these species at coarser spatial scales, but other variables gain importance at fine scales, such as land use and cover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. The future loss of climate suitability in sympatric areas of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> might influence local changes in the distribution of both species and in the transmission of CL.
