<p class="p">Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] previously published an ecological niche model for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.), but not for each of the two species owing to the paucity of confirmed presence records at the time. Based on a GARP model, Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] found that environments suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.) extended from Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará states in northeast Brazil, south along Brazil’s eastern coast into Uruguay and Argentina, and west into Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru, with small disjunct pockets in Colombia and Guyana. Using two climate change scenarios, HHGSDX50 (conservative) and HHGGAX50 (extreme), they predicted 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia </italic>(
 <italic class="italic">s.l</italic>.) will experience slight climatic improvements in its current habitats, and spread further along the eastern slopes of the Andes [
