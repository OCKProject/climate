<p class="p">Again considering resolution, Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] utilised scenarios from the HadCM2 coupled climate model, which has a much coarser resolution than the HadGEM2 predictions used in the present study (417 × 278 km at the equator compared to 208 × 139 km) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. HadGEM2 also accounts for more climate change processes, including modifications to vegetation through a dynamic vegetation layer, and has demonstrated significant improvements in predictive ability on previous Met Office climate models [
