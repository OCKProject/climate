<p class="p">There are several potential explanations for the differences in our findings and those of Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. First, the latter used only the GARP program, rather than the ensemble approach utilised in this study. This new approach significantly reduces the prediction uncertainty from the use of a single algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Additionally, the dataset they worked from could not account for sand fly surveys conducted post-2001 and therefore had fewer records. Consequently, the significance of relationships between predictor and response variables may have been misinterpreted. To test the impact of these differences, we removed post-2001 studies from our dataset and applied the GARP algorithm to the reduced list (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). The results were similar for the GARP and ensemble analyses, but neither predicted the pattern of range expansion reported in 2003 [
