<p class="p">Additionally, the resolution of current and past climate data utilised by Peterson &amp; Shaw [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] was coarser than it is in the present investigation, at five arc minutes rather than 2.5. While extremely high-resolution environmental data layers are not required for ecological niche modelling based on climate data, finer spatial data can capture environmental variability, particularly in mountainous areas, that can be obscured at coarser resolutions [
