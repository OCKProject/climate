<p class="p">In a comparative study of the performance of five modelling techniques, Elith &amp; Graham [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] found GARP was consistently outperformed by the newer methods, a result consistent with the findings of Peterson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. In particular, it was prone to over-predicting the test species' distribution and had relatively low sensitivity and specificity scores. Therefore, the updated methods and dataset used in the present study are likely to have produced more accurate predictions of the current and future climatically suitable ranges of
