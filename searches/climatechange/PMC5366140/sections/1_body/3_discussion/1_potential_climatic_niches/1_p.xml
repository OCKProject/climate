 <italic class="italic">Lutzomyia intermedia</italic> was shown to be the more tropical of the two species, with its climatic niche being defined by higher annual mean temperatures, lower temperature seasonality and sometimes higher precipitation seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> was shown to be more subtropical, and diapause [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] might allow it to survive very high-temperature seasonality sometimes associated with lower precipitation seasonality. The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> to survive in warmer and more humid environments than 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> was previously suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Differences in latitudinal ranges explain the predicted responses of the two species to climate change, with the tropical 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic> mostly contracting its range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), and the subtropical 
 <italic class="italic">L. neivai</italic> mostly shifting its range southwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). This is a common difference between tropical and subtropical species, probably resulting from their adaptations to natural climate change in previous geological periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>].
