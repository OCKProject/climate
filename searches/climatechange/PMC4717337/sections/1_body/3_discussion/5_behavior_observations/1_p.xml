<p class="p">We found pika activity was lowest when temperatures were highest, which is consistent with the literature (e.g., Barash 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>; MacArthur and Wang 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>; Smith 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>). Niche Mapper identified a limiting temperature threshold of 20°C for a 150 g pika with summer fur, above which we observed restrictions in most above‐talus behaviors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). We found no correlation between behavior and temperature below this threshold, suggesting that other factors may exert stronger influences on behavior below 20°C. For example, the predominance of short activity bouts may play a role in predator avoidance. Pika calls, which were negatively correlated with temperature, probably serve as a conspecific territorial defense mechanism and a predator alarm (Conner 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>), but may also increase individual predation risk by revealing the caller's location (Smith and Ivins 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). Our results suggest that temperature may modulate an individual's cost–benefit curve for making vocalizations as well as restrict above‐talus activity.
