<p class="p">Although recent work has shown that pika extirpations during the past 35–55 years in the Great Basin were correlated with high mean summer temperatures and both extreme heat in the summer and extreme cold in the winter (Beever et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), the mechanisms driving these losses are unclear. A critical gap exists regarding our understanding of how climate and pika physiology interact to affect behavior. Thus, it is unclear how pika physiological tolerances and behavioral flexibility will impact their individual and population‐level responses to rapid climate change. To date, the most thorough studies of pika behavior relative to temperature found that pikas were less active during midday, especially at lower elevation sites (Smith 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>), and that activity durations were short. It was presumed that pikas used short activity bouts to limit heat accumulation and used the sub‐talus microclimate to dissipate heat (MacArthur and Wang 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>). Others have reported midday activity decreases in GNP (Barash 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>), as well as the Sierra Nevada (Severaid 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1955</xref>) and Great Basin (Hall 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1946</xref>). However, research in Colorado (Broadbooks 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>; Krear 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>), and the high Sierra (Grinnell and Storer 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1917</xref>) suggested that pikas remained active throughout the day. Thus, analysis of the mechanisms driving pika extirpations requires a greater biophysical understanding of pikas as well as their capacity to behaviorally thermoregulate.
