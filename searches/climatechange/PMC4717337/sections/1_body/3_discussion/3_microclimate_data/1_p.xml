<p class="p">Uncertainty in a temperature‐occupancy threshold for pikas in the literature (e.g., Beever et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Millar and Westfall 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Smith and Nagy 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) may stem from a reliance on broad‐scale weather data in place of pika‐relevant microclimate data (Potter et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Mean free atmospheric lapse rates are too coarse to accurately characterize temperature over complex terrain and at fine spatial scales (Minder et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Instead, regional monthly and daily surface temperature lapse rates such as those we calculated are more appropriate (Blandford et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), especially when combined with a microclimate model such as Niche Mapper's. We identified relatively large variation in the relationship between the microclimates available to pikas and elevation in GNP; when consistent, this lapse rate had a 1–3°C greater magnitude than expected for the region (Ray et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Pikas could potentially exploit this variability during warmer summers by increasing their activity during short periods of favorable conditions or even increasing nocturnal activity (Severaid

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>). We recommend caution when applying large‐scale climate data and model predictions, such as lapse rate estimates, in mountainous terrain.
