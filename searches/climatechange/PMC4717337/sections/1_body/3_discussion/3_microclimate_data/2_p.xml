<p class="p">The thermal refuge beneath the talus plays a critical role in pika thermoregulation. We found that it provided a buffer of up to 20°C during the hottest times of day, which is consistent with the literature (MacArthur and Wang

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), although it can be more pronounced in the presence of subsurface ice features (Wilkening et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This buffer allows pikas to remain active under the talus surface and avoid acute heat stress or death on hot days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, our simulations showed that relatively shallow talus may provide insufficient thermal refuge during heat waves, especially in the late afternoon and early evening, such that microclimates become unsuitable both above and below the talus.
