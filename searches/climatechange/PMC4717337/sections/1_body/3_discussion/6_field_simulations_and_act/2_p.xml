<p class="p">We demonstrated that fur properties, molt timing, and animal size have significant metabolic impacts on pikas, thereby constraining activity time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The role of fur properties in pika behavior, morphology, and physiology has, to date, been unexamined. To our knowledge, only three studies have documented pika fur properties. Krear (

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1924</xref>) documented two annual molts, noting that summer pelage is generally worn for &lt; 2 months and that winter fur is up to twice the length of summer fur, while Severaid (
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1955</xref>) examined the effect of reproductive status on molt timing. However, the extent to which subpopulations inhabiting disparate climatic regions (or microclimates on the same mountain) vary in fur properties and molt timing is not well known. Our simulations suggested that plasticity in molt timing, to a certain degree, may reduce activity restrictions predicted under future warming scenarios. In particular, pikas that shed their winter pelage sooner could be less restricted in early growing season activity.
