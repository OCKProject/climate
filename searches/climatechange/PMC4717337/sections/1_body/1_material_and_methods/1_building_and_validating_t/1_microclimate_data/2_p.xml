<p class="p">In the second stage, we used four loggers to measure the thermal refuge provided by the talus by measuring above‐ and below‐talus temperature at two locations representing elevation extremes (1056 m and 2521 m). At both sites, one logger was placed, unshaded, on top of the talus. The other was placed under the same rock and next to a hay‐pile. These loggers recorded temperature and relative humidity at 20‐min intervals. We did not deploy loggers at all behavioral observation sites, so in order to interpolate above‐ and below‐talus temperatures at those sites, we applied our estimated lapse rate of −8°C/km (from stage one) to the stage‐two thermal refuge data. Our estimated lapse rate fell within the range considered appropriate for GNP (Ray et al.
