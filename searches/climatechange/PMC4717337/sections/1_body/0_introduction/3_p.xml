<p class="p">For many such species presumed and demonstrated to be at risk from climate change, considerable gaps in our understanding exist concerning the driving biological mechanisms, because fine‐scale data on the physiological effects of the thermal environment are rarely available (Beever and Belant 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Biophysical models therefore hold enormous potential for complementing traditional correlative approaches to fill gaps in knowledge for species of conservation concern. For the American pika (

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In particular, more data are needed concerning pikas' abilities to tolerate high ambient temperatures through behavioral thermoregulation. This need, along with its known temperature sensitivity, makes the pika an ideal model organism for investigating temperature‐driven behavior modification from a biophysical perspective.
