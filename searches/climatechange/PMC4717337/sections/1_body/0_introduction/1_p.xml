<p class="p">Species respond to rising temperatures in numerous ways. For example, some shift the elevation or latitude of their range (Thomas

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, before shifting geographically, individuals attempt to tolerate novel environmental conditions and maintain their mass/energy balance through behavioral thermoregulation (Huey et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). These earliest responses to environmental change may not initially reduce body condition below thresholds where individual survival or fecundity is impacted. However, as environmental conditions deviate further from the range of conditions to which organisms are ecologically adapted, individuals may be forced to make behavioral trade‐offs to maintain energy balance (Speakman and Król

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), which, on relatively short timescales, may lead to population‐level effects such as range shifts, local extirpations, and ultimately extinction (e.g., Sinervo et al.
