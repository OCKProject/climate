<p class="p">To understand and predict the earliest behavioral responses to climate change, we must consider the biophysical mechanisms that limit the activity of organisms. Optimality theory states that organisms evolve to make behavioral decisions so as to maximize their fitness, and these decisions are informed by environmental cues that may have historically limited fitness (Westneat and Fox 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For example, at the height of a temperate growing season, organisms may limit foraging time when temperatures are high, and instead rest or take refuge in cooler microclimates. Although foraging confers essential fitness benefits through the improvement or maintenance of body condition, resting or taking refuge when temperatures are high may confer even greater fitness benefits by reducing heat gain and avoiding hyperthermia (Ricklefs and Miller 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). These critical decisions are fundamentally governed by the biophysical parameters of organisms (i.e., metabolic rate, surface properties) in combination with the external environmental conditions (i.e., landscape, microclimate) in which the organism resides, which together comprise the underpinning features of biophysical animal models. Biophysical models may prove useful in predicting how different animal populations are affected by climate and how they may respond; essential information for management and recovery of imperiled species. For example, biophysical models may allow us to better prioritize conservation efforts by identifying species with the least ability to tolerate rising temperatures through behavioral thermoregulation and also species whose fundamental and realized niches may move beyond the borders of current protected areas (Monzon etÂ al.
