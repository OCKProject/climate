<p class="p">In addition to our model selection‐based approach evaluating aggregate pika activity in relation to minimum above‐talus temperature and site‐level variables, we used an ANOVA‐based approach to evaluate whether minimum above‐talus temperature and time of day were significantly related to specific pika behaviors. We found that pikas were significantly more active in all behavior categories (except for haying) when minimum above‐talus temperature was below 20°C (all
