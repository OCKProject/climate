<p class="p">The difference between below‐ and above‐talus temperature varied considerably depending on the time of day, and generally below‐talus temperatures were less variable than above‐talus temperatures. In the mornings (05:15–08:15), temperatures below the talus were slightly warmer than above‐talus conditions, with higher minimum (mean°C below talus – mean°C above talus [standard deviation]: +2.50°C [1.69°C]), and maximum temperatures (+2.62°C [1.69°C]). During the warmest part of the day (13:00–16:00), the temperature‐damping effects of the below‐talus thermal refuge were most pronounced, exhibiting substantially lower minimum (−13.08°C [2.42°C]) and maximum temperatures (−15.44°C [1.94°C]). The evenings (19:00–21:00) produced higher minimum temperatures below‐talus (+2.75°C [1.95°C]), but lower maximums (−3.75°C [1.78°C]).</p>
