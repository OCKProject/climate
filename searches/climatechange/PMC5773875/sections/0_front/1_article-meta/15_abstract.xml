 <p id="Par1" class="p">The impacts of climate on health and wellbeing occur in time and space and through a range of indirect, complicated mechanisms. This diversity of pathways has major implications for national public health planning and influence on interventions that might help to mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, nationally and internationally. This paper draws upon evidence from public health and adverse impact studies across climate science, hydrology, agriculture, public health, and the social sciences. It presents a conceptual model to support decision-making by recognizing both the 
  <italic class="italic">proximal</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">distal</italic> pathways from climate-induced environmental change to national health and wellbeing. The 
  <italic class="italic">proximal</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">distal</italic> pathways associated with food security, migration and mobility illustrate the diverse climate change influences in different geographic locations over different timescales. We argue that greater realization and articulation of proximal and distal pathways should radically alter how climate change is addressed as a national and international public health challenge.
