<p id="Par19" class="p">The MEA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] achieved a more inclusive and policy-relevant representation of the wider importance of ecosystem services by identifying four different types of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting. The MEA also projected how ecosystem services impact on human wellbeing, whether through the supply of material goods or through supporting social relations, security and freedom of choice and undermining health itself. Since then, the concept and structure of ecosystem services and their relationships with, and relevance for, humanity have been widely discussed. Fisher et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] distinguish between 
 <italic class="italic">intermediate</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">final</italic> ecosystem services, while De Groot et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] relate ecosystem functions and the services they provide in a comprehensive, integrated framework, incorporating earlier work by Daily et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. A common feature of many ecosystem services (ES) definitions, e.g. as used in the MEA and the UK National Ecosystem Assessment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] is that some services provide direct benefits (provisioning, regulating and cultural ES). In contrast others, like nutrient recycling or soil formation underpin ecosystem function (supporting ES).
