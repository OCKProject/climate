<p id="Par18" class="p">More recently, Reis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] developed an ecosystems enriched (
 <bold class="bold">eDPSEEA</bold>) model to make explicit how environmental health encompasses both the proximal environmental determinants of health and wellbeing, and also the impacts caused by anthropogenic damage to ecosystems. The 
 <bold class="bold">eDPSEEA</bold> model incorporates the insights of the MEA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] by explicitly linking ecosystem services (the benefits which humans derive from ecosystems) to human health and wellbeing within a notional chain of causation. It presents the health of humans and of ecosystems as intimately interconnected, and thus equally important to consider both as important outcomes.
