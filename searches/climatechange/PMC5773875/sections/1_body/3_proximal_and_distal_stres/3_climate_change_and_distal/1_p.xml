 <sub class="sub">2</sub> both lead to a changing climate and can reduce the nutritional quality of crop production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Relative to an unchanging climate, yields of principal agricultural crops are already being affected globally, and have the potential to decline without major adaptations in technology and water use efficiency [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. These changes are spatially sensitive, with risks of yield decrease likely to be greater in the hotter parts of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. However, there is considerable scope for the food and trade-system to adapt to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. This might be achieved via changes in the area of production (expansion of which may exacerbate climate change by liberating carbon in land conversion), and through impacts on trade and prices. However, given the complexity of the system, it is not clear how the multiple potential drivers of food availability and price will interact around issues such as: food for feed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]; biofuels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]; carbon pricing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]; water availability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]; competition for land and other resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]; and the need for agriculture to be sustainable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Increasing weather variability may lead to short term unexpected shocks to supply [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>] that create significant volatility in food prices, impacting on the wellbeing of food insecure populations in all parts of the world.
