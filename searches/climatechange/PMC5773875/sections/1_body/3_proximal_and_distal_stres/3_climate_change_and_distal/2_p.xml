<p id="Par25" class="p">Variation in prices driven by weather-related impacts have accentuated price shocks and created localized food shortages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]; both factors impact most, the poor sections of populations. For example, in the UK, analysis of purchases following the 2007/8 global commodity food price spike show that as prices increased, households purchased 4.2% less food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>] and bought lower quality alternatives. The greatest impact was on the poorest income decile: they spent 17% more in 2011 compared to 2007, so their relative food bill increased by 40% more than the UK average. On a global basis, food price spikes, driven by weather in the main bread-basket regions, directly impact market prices in the import-dependent low income countries, as well as indirectly influencing the food aid donated by the rich world. As a result, in sub-Saharan Africa particularly, the number of hungry increased following the 2007/8 and 2010/11 food price spikes. Furthermore, the food price spike of 2010/11 has been estimated to have pushed &gt;40 million people globally below basic needs poverty line in those years [
