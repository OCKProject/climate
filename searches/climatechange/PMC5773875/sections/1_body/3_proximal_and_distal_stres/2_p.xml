<p id="Par23" class="p">Individuals and socio-economic groups in local environments are affected by a combination of proximal and distal effects, some immediate, but others subsequently translated by economic, biogeochemical and resource flow mechanisms. These mechanisms have been elaborated by Adger et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] as teleconnections linking vulnerabilities across space and time, and by Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] as connections between sending, receiving and spillover systems. Here, we develop insights using a dichotomy between the distal and the proximal pathways from environmental change to human health and wellbeing, recognizing the inherent complexity of most interactions. Macro and micro level processes continually interact and are tele-connected through systemic environmental processes, through the flows of material and mobility of populations around the world, and, importantly, through market and economic linkages [
