<p id="Par31" class="p">The principal form of migration globally, however, continues to be the movement of populations to urban centers within their national borders. In terms of absolute numbers, this trend is apparent and stark in Asia and Africa in particular [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Geographically, these migration trends are fueling trends of population movement towards coasts, and movement away from dry land and mountain environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. This dominant migration trend, in terms of numbers, creates significant environmental and public health challenges. The migrant populations moving into cities are differentially exposed to climate hazards in those places: low income migrant communities are often located in flood prone zones or areas susceptible to landslides. Migrant populations cluster in areas with low air quality or in slums with lack of access to sanitation or clean water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Hence migration trends exacerbate environmental health risks: as many people are moving towards risks as moving away from them. These processes have both distal and proximal dimensions.
