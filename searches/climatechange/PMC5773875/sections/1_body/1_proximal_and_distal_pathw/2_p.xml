<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we propose the terms 
 <italic class="italic">proximal</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">distal</italic> pathways to better capture the true landscape of risks for those living in a particular location or country. The near term and lived proximal experience of climate change is related to encountering local and current changes in daily and seasonal weather patterns and extreme events. These manifestations, and their implications for health and wellbeing, can be widely understood and addressed (in part) by local responses, adding a sense of urgency and purpose to local adaptation and mitigation efforts.
