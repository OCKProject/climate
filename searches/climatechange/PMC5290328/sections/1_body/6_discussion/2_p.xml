<p class="p">Our findings suggest large and regionally variable shifts in the distribution of temperate drylands under a changing climate, and highlight the complex interplay between seasonal soil water resources and intensified ecological droughts during the growing season that differ with soil depth. While increased water availability at depth would be expected with more cold-season precipitation (favouring woody and deep-rooted species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>), our results suggest instead a soil moisture regime that is increasingly dominated by longer ecological droughts particularly at depth and by available water restricted to surface soils (favouring shallow-rooted herbaceous species

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>) and the cool season (favouring winter annuals, including invasive grasses
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>). Increasing water scarcity in deep soils is relevant for ecosystem function because soil moisture at depth is an important resource for deep-rooted woody species as drought proceeds

Our study emphasizes the need to differentiate among drylands and describes intensifications of seasonal and soil depth patterns of drought that could affect temperate dryland plant communities and the services they provide, including water resources, wildlife habitat, soil conservation, agriculture and carbon storage.
