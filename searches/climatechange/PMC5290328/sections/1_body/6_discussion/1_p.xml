<p class="p">Net reductions in the area of temperate drylands occurred in our projections following an intermediate and a high-emission scenario across all five temperate dryland regions and illustrate the different impact of climate change on the distribution of temperate versus subtropical drylands. The latter are projected to expand due to conversions from temperate to subtropical climate in addition to increased aridity in currently sub-humid subtropical regions
