<p class="p">Ecological droughts during growing periods, which we estimated as the longest snow-free, frost-free period when soil water potential was continuously &lt;−3.0 MPa, could last longer under projected future scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Our model, driven by soil data and climate inputs from 16 GCMs, projected increasing drought periods in every temperate dryland region, except for parts of Asia, that are not projected to shift in distribution under climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>). Ecological droughts may become longer over 65% (31–96% among GCMs) of the area of temperate drylands in surface soil layers (0–20 cm) and 85% (68–97%) in deeper layers (&gt;20 cm). This increase in growing season droughts coincided with a reduction of the warm/wet season overlap due to increasing cold-season precipitation (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 6–7</xref>). Increasing ecological drought, particularly during the warm and dry season

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. East Asia is the only region with projections that consistently diverged from the trend of increasing ecological drought, which is consistent with previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. This may be related to East Asia being the only region with a positive warm/wet season overlap (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Ecological droughts in East Asia may become shorter instead of longer in over 43% (surface layers) and 26% (deeper layers) of the region.
