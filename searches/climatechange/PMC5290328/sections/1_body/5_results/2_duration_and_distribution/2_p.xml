<p class="p">The projected intensification of ecological droughts is more pronounced for deep layers (+10%, 0–20%, corresponding to +18 days, 8–38 days, longer dry periods) than surface layers (0%, −12 to 30%; +2.6 days, −7 to 17 days) particularly for contracting and expanding zones. This result was surprising since increased cold-season precipitation might be expected to enhance available soil moisture at depth due to reduced evaporative competition for percolating soil moisture

As a consequence of differential drying of deep versus surface soil layers, future vegetation was projected to extract more water from shallow rather than deeper layers. Our simulations suggest that overall the importance of transpiration from shallow layers increases under climate change, that is, the proportion of total transpiration that derives from deep layers decreases (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>). We estimated the proportion of transpired water derived from deep soil layers to decrease by a median of 8% (4–12%) for South America, 2% (−2 to 7%) for Central and Western Asia, 11% (7–15%) for the Western Mediterranean basin, and 5% (−1 to 9%) for North America. The exception was again East Asia where we estimated increased water uptake (2%, −2 to 5%) from deep soil layers (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>). Our simulation results suggest also that transpiration from shallow layers may increase in the median case in most regions. Median decreases occur in the Western Mediterranean basin and the expanding zone of South America. In addition, our results also indicate a heterogeneous pattern where the overall regional trends are interrupted at smaller spatial scales (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>). This heterogeneous pattern of the geographic distribution of increases and decreases is more prominent for transpiration derived from soil moisture at deep soil layers (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>). Among regions and within some regions (specifically East Asia, South America and the Western Mediterranean), we found a negative relationship between the projected change in the proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture and the current value (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). This negative relationship indicates a homogenization of plant water uptake among soil layers implying a reduction of niche spaces, associated plant functional types, and biodiversity
