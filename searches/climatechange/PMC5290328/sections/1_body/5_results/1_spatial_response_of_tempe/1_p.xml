 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>, that general statement masks our result that temperate drylands may contract while subtropical drylands expand. We found that a median of 36% (24–51% among GCMs) of current temperate drylands would be converted under the considered scenario mainly to warmer subtropical drylands (
