 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, responses to increased droughts and warming under climate change remain difficult to constrain. Potential outcomes include plant functional type shifts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>, woody plant mortality
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> and encroachment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, and resistance of some vegetation types
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. These vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on seasonal and soil depth dynamics of soil moisture in addition to climate
