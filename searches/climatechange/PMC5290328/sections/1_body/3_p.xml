<p class="p">We applied a two-tiered approach to assess consequences of climate change for global temperate, arid and semiarid drylands. First, we quantified zones of contraction, expansion and stability of the distribution of five temperate dryland regions. Second, we estimated impacts of climate change on seasonal and depth patterns of ecological drought, and their consequences for plant water uptake using SOILWAT

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, an ecosystem water balance simulation model. SOILWAT utilizes site-specific soils and weather data (here we evaluated spatially and temporally downscaled output from 16 GCMs driven by an intermediate and a high emissions scenario), and SOILWAT soil moisture outputs compare very favourably with GCM estimates (see Methods). Furthermore, SOILWAT provides high temporal resolution (daily) information about ecosystem water balance and plant available moisture that reflects the influence of site-specific soil conditions.
