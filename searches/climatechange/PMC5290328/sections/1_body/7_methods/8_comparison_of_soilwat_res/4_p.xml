<p class="p">The resulting Budyko curves agree well with SOILWAT output that was aggregated without functional constraints, for example, when summarized by locally weighted polynomial regression lines (

This comparison confirms that that actual evapotranspiration in dry regions is limited not primarily by potential evapotranspiration rates, but by other factors including seasonal soil moisture, soil conditions, and vegetation
