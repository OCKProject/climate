<p class="p">We compared projections of GCMs against SOILWAT output of mean monthly soil moisture. The variable ‘mrso' (total soil moisture content) was extracted for seven GCMs under historical and future (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios from non-downscaled data from the ESGF node

We calculated normalized mean monthly values for the periods of 1980–2005 and 2070–2099 for each of our simulated raster cells and compared agreement with equivalent soil moisture values from SOILWAT output. We estimated agreement between models with Duveiller's
