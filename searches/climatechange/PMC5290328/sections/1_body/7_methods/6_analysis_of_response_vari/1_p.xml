<p class="p">Each SOILWAT simulation run produced daily output for each process and water compartment for the 31-year simulation period discarding the first year as spin-up (see ‘Simulation framework'). On the basis of the daily data, we calculated derived response variables (see next paragraph) and then aggregated temporally across 31 years by mean and standard deviation. We calculated these derived and aggregated variables for the current climate condition and for 16 GCMs under two RCPs. We captured the variation among GCMs for each RCP by agreement level of temperate dryland classification and by the selection of study area cells for the aggregation of response variable values (details in ‘Variation of response variables'). Because our simulation experiment was deterministic, we estimated effect sizes and performed an evaluation of simulation results, but no statistical hypothesis testing
