<p class="p">We chose two derived response variables to capture ecohydrological constraints on potential vegetation. We estimated the mean annual duration of continuous ecological droughts during growing periods for surface soil layers of 0–20 cm depth (DDGP0) and for deep soil layers&gt;20 cm depth (DDGP20) as the longest snow-free, frost-free period when soil water potential (SWP)&lt;−3.0 MPa continuously. We estimated mean annual proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture (&gt;20 cm depth; T20/T) as the ratio of transpiration resulting from water uptake from deep soil layers (T20) to transpiration resulting from water uptake from all soil layers (T).</p>
