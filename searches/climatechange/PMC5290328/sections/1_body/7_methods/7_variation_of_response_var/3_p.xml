<p class="p">We estimated the relative contributions of cells, regions, shifting zones, GCMs, and RCPs to the variation of two groups of variables: climate inputs/drivers (MAT, MAP, AI, PET, wet/warm-season overlap) and the derived ecohydrological response variables. We calculated the uniquely attributable variation based on additive elements by Whittaker

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" class="xref">81</xref> as percentage of the total variation for each variable for the extent of the study area for each climate condition. We partitioned the variation for the absolute variable values under each climate condition and as difference between future and current conditions. Absolute values indicated that most of the variation was attributable to among-cell variation (mean±1 s.d. are 68±30% for climate drivers, and 63±19% for response variables) and most of the rest to among-region variation (

Variation attributable to among-GCM and among-RCP variation were of similar size, but only relevant for differences between future and current conditions (20±11% and 22±27% for climate drivers, and 9±5% and 7±12% for response variables). The large variation among climate drivers for the attribution of RCP arose because MAT and PET were primarily driven by variation in RCP whereas other drivers (MAP, AI, wet/warm-season overlap) showed larger variation among GCMs.
