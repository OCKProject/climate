<p class="p">We estimated level of spatial agreement by counting GCMs that classified a cell as temperate dryland. We identified three shifting zones for each GCM: the contracting zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under current, but not under future climate condition; the stable zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under current and future conditions; the expanding zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under future, but not current conditions. We calculated summaries by region and shifting zone in two steps to simultaneously account for both aspects of variation among GCMs, that is, the within-cell and the spatial components. We first calculated for each GCM the target summary statistic among those cells that are part of a zone and region. In a second step, we calculated the median value among the 16 GCM summary values and used the minimum–maximum GCM range as indicator of among GCM variation. We determined for each shift the contribution of each defining factor and determined whether a cell changed the climate classification between temperate and boreal
