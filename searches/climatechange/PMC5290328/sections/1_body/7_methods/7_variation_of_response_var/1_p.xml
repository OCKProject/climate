<p class="p">We allowed for variation among raster cells within regions, variation among regions, variation among RCPs, and variation among GCMs. Here, we reported results under RCP8.5, which is closely tracked by recent greenhouse gas emissions

In the article, we focus on variation among regions and among GCMs (note: overall variation among RCP was for precipitation-related variables as large as variation among GCMs, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). The variation among GCMs arose due to spatial variation of extent and location of our study area (temperate drylands are defined as a function of climate) and due to within-cell variation in forcing from the 16 GCMs.
