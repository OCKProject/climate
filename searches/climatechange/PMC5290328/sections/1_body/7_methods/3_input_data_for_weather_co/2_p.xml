<p class="p">We extracted for the centre of each cell 32 projected future climate conditions as monthly time-series for 2069–2099 from 1/2° downscaled and bias-corrected products of the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project

We combined historical daily data (NCEP/CFSR) with monthly GCM projections of historical and future conditions with a hybrid-delta downscaling approach to obtain future daily forcing
