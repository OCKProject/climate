The typical precipitation regime under current conditions was dominated by cold-season precipitation except for Eastern Asia, which showed consistent warm-season precipitation. Winter precipitation is the sum of mean monthly precipitation of December, January and February on the northern hemisphere, and the sum of mean monthly precipitation of June, July and August on the southern hemisphere. Wet/warm-season overlap is the mean annual Pearson correlation coefficient between mean monthly temperature (° C) and monthly precipitation (mm). +1 indicates a perfect match between the warm and wet season; −1 indicates a perfect match between the cold and the wet season. Median changes in the overlap of the wet/warm-season were for each region (except South America) and overall mostly small with a trend towards less wet/warm-overlap by −0.019 (−0.064 to 0.045), but varied within regions and among GCMs from more wet/cold- to more wet/warm-season overlap (
