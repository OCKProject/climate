<p class="p">We identified temperate drylands using three criteria: mean annual temperature (MAT), the Trewartha climate classification scheme
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>, and the FAO/UNEP aridity index (AI) (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>). In addition, we restricted the analysis to areas with soils of less than 90% sand content. We classified temperate areas if MAT&gt;0 ° C and Trewartha climate group was category D, that is, the number of months with mean temperatures ≥10 ° C is ≥4 but &lt;8. We included areas as drylands if 0.05≤AI&lt;0.5, that is, arid and semiarid types excluding hyper-arid
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. AI was calculated as MAP/PET, where PET is potential evapotranspiration and MAP is the mean annual precipitation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>, particularly, this index is equivalent to the inverse aridity index of the Budyko framework
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. Because our classification is climate dependent, we determined the study area under current climate and for each future climate scenario.
