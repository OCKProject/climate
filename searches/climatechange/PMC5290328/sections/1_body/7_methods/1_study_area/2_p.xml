<p class="p">We applied a geographic raster with 0.3125° square cells, so that exactly one cell centre of the NCEP/CFSR T382 Gaussian grid
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref> fell in each of our cells. Our raster contained 1,152 × 576 cells and had its origin at 90° S and 179.84375° W. We made an initial generous estimate due to lack of complete knowledge about which cells may be identified as temperate drylands. From the total possible 663,552 cells in the raster, we included 20,021 cells for running simulations. After completing simulation runs, we determined that 12,638 out of the 20,021 raster cells classified as temperate drylands under either current climate or at least one future scenario. We considered only this subset of cells for further analysis.
