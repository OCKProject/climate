<p class="p">Soil texture data were derived from the ISRIC-WISE global soil data set
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref> at 5 arc-min spatial resolution and at 20 cm depth intervals up to 1 m. We split the 0–20 cm layer into two 10 cm deep layers to improve the representation of surface soil processes and account for ISRIC-WISE cells of 10 cm depth (lithosols). We calculated sand and clay content for each layer and cell as area-weighted averages of soil map units and soil types. Soil depth was based on the ISRIC-WISE data set unless the soil was deeper that 1 m, in which case depth was estimated as 95% of the maximum root depth with 50 cm depth intervals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref> and soil texture was assumed to be the same as the deepest ISRIC-WISE layer. We calculated elevation for each raster cell as area-weighted median based on a 30-arcsec global elevation data set
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>.
