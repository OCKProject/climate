<p class="p">Here we illustrate that GCMs for the late twenty first century project a net loss of c. 15% (following the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>)) to 30% (following RCP8.5) of current temperate dryland extent due to climatic changes. We show that the duration of ecological droughts during growing periods may substantially increase, especially in deeper (&gt;20â€‰cm) soils. Water uptake by vegetation under future climate could be increasingly reliant on surface soil moisture, favouring shallow-rooted over deep-rooted vegetation, which contrasts with previous projections of increasing dryland woody encroachment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. Plant water uptake patterns within and among regions are projected to become more similar, suggesting a homogenization of niche spaces and vegetation composition. Our findings emphasize contrasting spatial trajectories between subtropical and temperate drylands and highlight the need to assess seasonal as well as spatial patterns of soil moisture dynamics to understand factors that shape the future of temperate drylands and the services they provide.
