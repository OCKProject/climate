  <title class="title">Relationship of the proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture between current values and its future response.</title>
  <p class="p">Current values refer to transpiration derived from soil moisture at &gt;20 cm depth; future response refers to the change between values under RCP8.5 for 2070–2100 and current values. Regional responses are summarized for each GCM by locally weighted polynomial regressions (lines) and 90% data clouds (shaded areas) for all areas that meet either current and/or future classification (
