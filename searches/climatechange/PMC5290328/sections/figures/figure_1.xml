  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Five temperate dryland regions with their current extent for 1980–2010 (green): (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) South America; (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) North America; (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Western and Central Asia; (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) Mediterranean Basin; (
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) Eastern Asia. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) Future projected change in extent under RCP8.5 for 2070–2100, depicted as stable (grey), contracting (orange; no longer temperate dryland in 2070–2100), and expanding (blue; newly temperate dryland in 2070–2100) zones. Inset vertical histograms for 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> illustrate areal abundance in each category of GCM agreement about expansion or contraction of temperate drylands. Left (grey-orange) histogram depicts GCM agreement (that is, number of GCMs that agree in the direction of change) about the fate of current temperate drylands and shows the number of cells within each category ranging from pure grey (all 16 GCMs forecast stable temperate drylands) to pure orange (all GCMs forecast conversion from temperate dryland to non-temperate and/or non-dryland). Right (light blue—dark blue) histogram indicates GCM agreement of temperate dryland expansion into new areas and shows the number of cells within each category ranging from dark blue (all GCMs forecast conversion to temperate dryland) to light blue (one GCM forecasts conversion).
