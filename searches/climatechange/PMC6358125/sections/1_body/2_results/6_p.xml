<p id="para770" class="p">At a GTC corresponding to a 1·5°C increase, around 350 million people would be exposed to WBGTs exceeding the workability threshold (range 140 million–1·5 billion for individual models). For GTCs of approximately 2·5°C, the number of people exposed to WBGTs in excess of the workability threshold approaches 1 billion people in all models (median of 1·4 billion), consistent with highly-populated tropical and subtropical regions experiencing extreme heat stress (
