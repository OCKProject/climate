<p id="para760" class="p">The presence of extreme heat exposure in highly populated regions leads to amplified overall risks to workability and survivability. The number of people who are exposed to WBGTs that are greater than the thresholds for workability and survivability will reflect the interactions between regional exposure and population growth. The use of thresholds means that rapid changes in the exposed population can occur in response to natural climate variability and climate change, as we have modelled and as happens in reality. We have separated urban and rural populations to assess these interactions.</p>
