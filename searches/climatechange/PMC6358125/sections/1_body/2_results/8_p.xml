<p id="para790" class="p">Other models also showed considerable variability over several decades in exposure to the workability threshold in south Asia (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>). For example, the total population who would be exposed to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold increases in one decade by more than 500 million people at GTCs above 2·5°C in the projections based on the MIROC5 model, which is attributable largely to climate shifts on the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, even if the GTC increases relatively smoothly, the presence of a threshold in workability means that the population exposed can change suddenly.
