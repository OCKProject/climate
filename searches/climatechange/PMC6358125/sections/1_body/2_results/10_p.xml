<p id="para810" class="p">Projections with other models indicate smaller increases in population exposure to WBGTs greater than the survivability threshold as a function of the GTC; however, the number of people exposed is largest for GTCs corresponding to increases of more than 2·5°C. With the MIROC5 model, population exposure to heat stress greater than the survivability threshold increases by an order of magnitude to more than 40 million people for increases in global temperature of more than 2·5°C because more populous regions of north Africa are affected. Such associations highlight the sensitivity of threshold behaviours in coupled social-climate systems to projected patterns of population change, particularly in urban areas. All models showed that many millions of people could be exposed to heat stress that exceed thresholds for workability or survivability at increases in global temperature of more than 2·5°C.</p>
