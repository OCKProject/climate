<p id="para800" class="p">A smaller proportion of the global population is projected to be exposed to the survivability threshold than the workability threshold (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). According to several models, the exposure to the proposed threshold for survivability of heat stress was not reached in the recent past. From the multi-model median projection, the numbers of people exposed to risks to survivability increases with GTC, to reach around 20 million people globally at warming of about 2·5°C. For a mean global temperature increase across models of 3°C, about 50 million people globally would be exposed to WBGT above the survivability threshold, but with a large model uncertainty. Like the findings for risks to workability, populations exposed to a survivability threshold are predominantly located in urban areas. Projections based on the HadGEM2-ES model indicate non-linear increases in population exposure to WBGT greater than the survivability threshold from about 50 million people at increases of 1·5°C in global temperature to about 140 million people at increases of 2·5°C in global temperature. This abrupt increase in one model is associated with expansion of specific at-risk areas in central Africa (including Chad and Niger) and in highly populated areas of northeastern Pakistan and northern India.
