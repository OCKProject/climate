<p id="para780" class="p">The median population exposure to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold across several models increases as a function of GTC. All models project increases in the number of people exposed to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold of 100 million people or more for some decades as populous low-latitude areas smoothly cross thresholds of persistent extreme heat with increasing GTC (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). However, considerable variability exists across models and over decades. Projections based on one model, the GFDL-ESM2M, indicate an increase of about 1 billion people exposed to extreme heat stress that is greater than the workability threshold for GTCs approaching 1·5°C. Consistent with this result, projections with the GFDL-ESM2M model indicate more geographically widespread risks of extreme heat exposure at increases in global temperature of 1·5°C when compared with other models (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>). This rapid increase mainly arises when the workability threshold is crossed in urban centres of India and Pakistan. At increases in the global temperature exceeding 1·5°C, projections with the GFDL-ESM2M model indicate a smaller increase in total population exposed and a reduction in rural population exposure due to less geographically widespread extreme heat in rural populations of central north India (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>). This model behaviour indicates that persistent extreme heat across populous areas of south Asia might be strongly modulated by natural climate variability and how that variability is itself affected by climate change.
