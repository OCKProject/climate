<p id="para600" class="p">In this modelling study, we analysed the risk of heat exposure in humans at global scales, combining climate change projections for this century (ie, from the recent past [1986–2005] to 2100) from several current climate models with existing population projections. We used these combined climate–population scenarios to project changes to workability and survivability that could occur in response to GTC targets, based on recently proposed heat stress thresholds.</p>
