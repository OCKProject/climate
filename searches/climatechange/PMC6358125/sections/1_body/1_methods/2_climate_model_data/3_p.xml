 </xref> To adjust for bias, model variables were remapped onto a 0·5° regular grid with a first-order conservative scheme that preserved spatial averages. Bias adjustment to closely align model results with observations is necessary when applying temperature and humidity in studies of human effects that require absolute values rather than anomalies. The ISIMIP2b bias adjustment approach was previously described
