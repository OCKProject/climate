 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">17</sup>

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>) and no radiation sources. In-shade WBGT was used to represent a metric of unavoidable heat stress, as distinct from models of outdoor in-sun WBGT, which include the additional effects of total heat radiation.

  <sup class="sup">18</sup>
 </xref> WBGT was calculated from air temperature, vapour pressure, and barometric surface pressure (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>) with daily climate data, to simulate patterns of acute heat exposure. WBGT was estimated for the warmest part of the day by use of daily maximum surface air temperature. Vapour pressure was calculated from the ISIMIP2b daily mean specific humidity and barometric surface pressure, and dewpoint temperature was calculated from vapour pressure (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">appendix</xref>). Atmospheric moisture content changes derived from specific humidity show only a small diurnal component when compared with other metrics such as relative humidity, which depends on temperature and therefore has large diurnal variation. Additionally, we calculated estimates of GTC for each model from simulated land-ocean global mean surface temperature as decadal averages.
