<p id="para660" class="p">Mechanisms for thermoregulation of the human body and the physical responses to dangerous heat exposure are well understood. Although adaptation to present and future climate-driven heat stress is likely to result in varying population responses based on income level and other social factors, physiological thermodynamic arguments suggest that upper limits to adaptation could affect the survival of individuals.

 </xref> In the absence of reliable active cooling measures, such as air conditioning, extreme heat threatens the habitability of some regions as a result of inability to perform essential activities of daily living, such as physical work, when individual exposure thresholds are reached. Exposure to climate-change driven heat stress might have already caused rural to urban human migration in Pakistan.
