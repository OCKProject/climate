<p id="para680" class="p">The effects of heat exposure accumulate depending on the duration and persistence of the exposure. We used two thresholds that estimate aggregated daily heat exposure risks, which were adapted from the proposals of Kjellstrom and colleagues
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">25</sup>
 </xref> and broadly reflect the ability to work (workability) and the ability to survive for heat-sensitive people (survivability). These thresholds reflect current work safety measures with an additional 3-day persistence criterion for the survivability threshold, based on heatwave duration studies.
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref> These thresholds refer to shaded conditions without adaptation (eg, active cooling) and are therefore particularly relevant for countries where part of the economy relies on work in workshops and factories without efficient cooling.
