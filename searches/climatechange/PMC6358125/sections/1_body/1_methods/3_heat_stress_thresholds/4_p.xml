<p id="para690" class="p">We defined the upper threshold for workability as a monthly mean of the daily WBGT during the warmest part of the day of 34°C. For work that causes a metabolic rate of 300 W, in which the monthly mean WBGT for the hottest part of the day exceeds 34°C, it is suggested that it is too hot to work safely for a large part of the month.
