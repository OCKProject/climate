<p id="para700" class="p">The survivability threshold is defined as a heat stress condition in which exposure causes core body temperature to increase to potentially fatal levels during low-intensity physical activity.
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">25</sup>
 </xref> This threshold was set as daily maximum WBGT that exceeded 40Â°C for 3 consecutive days. This threshold builds on a previous study,
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">25</sup>
 </xref> but introduces the use of 3 consecutive days to provide a conservative estimate and limit the effects of avoidance strategies and adaptation, which could occur over longer periods of intermittent exposure. Increases in mortality rates during current heatwaves are related to both duration and intensity of exposure

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref> but largely affect older people. Our proposed survivability limit is much higher than current exposures and would threaten exposed people of all ages. In our study, we used Climate Data Operators version 1.7, pyFerret version 1.2.0, and Ferret version 6.93 software.
