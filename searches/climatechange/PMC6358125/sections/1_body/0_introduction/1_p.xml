The Paris Agreement states that the global community needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that the mean global temperature change (GTC) can remain well below a 2°C increase above pre-industrial levels, and that it needs to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1·5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the combined effect of the nationally determined contributions, representing the pledged mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions that countries submitted in advance of COP21, would result in an estimated GTC of around 3°C by 2100,
