<p id="para820" class="p">By use of physiology-based thresholds for workability and survivability under extreme temperatures, we showed that habitability has the potential to be impeded for some subtropical and tropical areas in response to projected climate change. Extreme heat exposure could affect hundreds of millions of people globally in response to GTCs that would meet international targets. These results agree with the conclusions of a previous study

 </xref> that used a different approach and did not directly assess thresholds of the survivability of populations. Non-linear interactions between risk of heat exposure and regional climate variability mean that substantial increases in populations exposed to heat stress above workability and survivability thresholds could occur within a decade. For instance, as highlighted by Rohini and colleagues,

In other tropical and subtropical regions where heat exposure risk is largest, annual variability in summertime WBGT has been shown to be low.
