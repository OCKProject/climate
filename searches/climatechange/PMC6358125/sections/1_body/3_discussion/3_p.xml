<p id="para840" class="p">Population growth is projected to be highest in the regions at the highest risk of heat exposure (eg, central and west Africa and south and southeast Asia), emphasising the importance of anticipating and preparing for future change with effective adaptation strategies. The largest changes in risks to workability and survivability occur in urban populations, where increases in heat stress could be further amplified by patterns of urbanisation and the associated changes in land use.

 </xref> Cities tend to be hotter than rural areas through the so-called urban heat island effect, which is not incorporated into these models and which includes heat loading outside buildings and reduced cooling from reduced evaporation. Our estimates of extreme heat exposure are therefore conservative for urban areas in the absence of air conditioning.
