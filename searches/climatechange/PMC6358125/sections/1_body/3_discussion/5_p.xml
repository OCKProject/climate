<p id="para860" class="p">Several measures could be implemented to reduce the risks of exposure to temperatures greater than workability and survivability thresholds. Such measures include keeping global temperature increases to the minimum possible and recognising that serious risks scale with the level of warming. The options for local adaptation are restricted to active cooling such as air conditioning or changing the work schedule to the coolest parts of the day or to different seasons, provided that these changes are affordable and practical. Millions of people might have no other adaptation option other than migration, either within the country (seasonally or permanently)
