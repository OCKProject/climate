<p id="para830" class="p">Risks of heat stress are lowest at lower GTCs; the proportion of the population that is likely to be exposed to WBGTs above workability thresholds is greatly reduced if GTCs remain at less than 1·5°C more than pre-industrial levels, at which point the projected population exposure reaches 350 million people (model range 140 million–1·5 billion). Risks to survivability are also lowest if GTCs remain at less than 1·5°C above pre-industrial levels, compared with a multi-model mean global temperature increase of approximately 3°C in which about 50 million people would be exposed globally; however, the model uncertainty for the number of people exposed to heat stress that would exceed the survivability threshold was large.</p>
