<p id="para850" class="p">Reducing people's capacity to work could increase poverty and inequality in some regions by reducing income or increasing risk of death because of pressure to maintain livelihoods. The ability to work will also be impaired to a considerable extent below the applied workability WBGT threshold and the limitations in work capacity will be particularly pronounced for heavy labour. For poor rural communities, it is also possible that subsistence farmers could be exposed to full-sun outdoor heat stress conditions in the future, which are, on average, 3Â°C WBGT higher than for the shaded conditions that we have estimated (

 </xref> For affected rural populations, there are few adaptation options because of the need to work outdoors all year and because of the high cost of air conditioning. As such, to combat workplace heat stress in low-income and middle-income countries affected by climate change, new occupational health initiatives and mechanisation will be required.
