  <p class="p">Global risks of occupational heat exposure in the shade during the hottest part of the day, averaged over the hottest month</p>
  <p class="p">Results are illustrative from an average of four models calibrated to observations. For global temperature increases of 1·5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the temperature change for individual models is taken from the first decade at which they reach that temperature. For global temperature increases of 3°C, 2090–99 is taken (which is the last decade available). Low risk was defined as a WBGT of 25°C or less; moderate risk was a WBGT of 26–29°C; high risk was a WBGT of 30–33°C; and extreme risk was a WBGT of 34°C or more. Results of individual models, which also show individual climate variability, are shown in the
