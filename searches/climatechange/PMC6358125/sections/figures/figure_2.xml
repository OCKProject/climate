  <p class="p">Number of people exposed to heat stress above the risks to workability and survivability thresholds at a given change in global mean surface temperature relative to pre-industrial levels</p>
  <p class="p">Data are shown for the effects of an increased global surface temperature on risks to workability, overall (A), and in urban (C) and rural (E) areas, and on risks to survivability, overall (B), and in urban (D) and rural (F) areas. Climate and population data are aggregated by decade and exposure reflects the population at the time a given GTC is reached. The workability threshold is crossed when the maximum monthly mean wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 34°C at the warmest part of the day, and the survivability threshold is crossed when the maximum daily wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 40 °C for 3 consecutive days. Median number of people exposed across the four models is shown for each decade. The median, rather than the mean, is used because it is more representative of the model ensemble, given the relatively small number of models and the large spread among models. Dotted lines are overlaid at an increase in global temperature of 1·5°C and 2°C.</p>
