An understanding of the effects of different global temperature changes on population health is needed to inform the continued implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and to increase global ambitions for greater cuts in emissions.

We defined and applied thresholds for risks to workability (where the monthly mean of daily maximum wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 34&#x000b0;C) and survivability (where the maximum daily wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 40&#x000b0;C for 3 consecutive days), and we used population projections to quantify changes in risk associated with different changes to the global temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The risks to workability increase substantially with global mean surface temperature in all four climate models, with approximately 1 billion people affected globally after an increase in the global temperature of about 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C above pre-industrial levels. There is greater variability between climate models for exposures above the threshold for risks to survivability than for risks to workability. The number of people who are likely to be exposed to heat stress exceeding the survivability threshold increases with global temperature change, to reach around 20 million people globally after an increase of about 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C, estimated from the median of the models, but with a large model uncertainty.

The Paris Agreement states that the global community needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that the mean global temperature change (GTC) can remain well below a 2&#x000b0;C increase above pre-industrial levels, and that it needs to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C above pre-industrial levels. However, the combined effect of the nationally determined contributions, representing the pledged mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions that countries submitted in advance of COP21, would result in an estimated GTC of around 3&#x000b0;C by 2100,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and a higher GTC if mitigation measures fail.</p><p id="para520">Exposure to high temperatures can cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> leading to aggregate effects that could reduce labour productivity<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and increase the risk of temperature-associated mortality.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> An increase in global summertime heat stress on humans between 1973 and 2012 has been reported.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Future increases in heat stress have been projected over the next few decades at the regional<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and global<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> scales in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.

By use of historical and projected climate conditions, we aimed to investigate the effects of climate change on workability (ie, the ability to work) and survivability (the ability to survive), which may have implications for the potential habitability of heat-vulnerable regions.</p><p id="para530"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para540"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para550">An important feature of global climate change is increasing air temperatures across most areas of the world. Extremes of atmospheric temperature are a known health hazard, since good health relies on maintaining the core body temperature within a narrow range (36&#x000b7;5&#x02013;37&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C) under different external environmental conditions. If core body temperature increases to more than 38&#x02013;39&#x000b0;C, there is a risk of heat exhaustion. At core body temperatures of more than 40&#x000b0;C, serious heat stroke can cause death. Evaporation of sweat is a key mechanism for cooling the body when the external temperature is above 35&#x000b0;C. In high-humidity environments, evaporation of sweat is inhibited, so this important natural heat loss mechanism is undermined. Many tropical and subtropical areas can already experience high levels of heat stress annually for several months of the year. Ongoing climate change is projected to substantially increase temperatures in many densely populated areas. In assessments of the health risks associated with increasing global temperature, it is essential to consider temperature, humidity, and the heat generated from physical activity. Acclimatisation to high temperature does occur, but there is a limit, and combinations of high temperature and high humidity can lead core temperature to reach problematic levels.</p><p id="para560"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para570">Most epidemiological studies and impact assessments have analysed the effects of high temperatures on mortality during heat waves and have focused on older people. In this study, we analysed the effects of temperature, humidity, and work rate on adults in their daily activities (workability) and on their physiological ability to cope with heat (survivability). By use of bias-corrected climate model data to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature, the most widely used heat-stress index used to assess health risks in physical work situations, we found that risks to workability and survivability increase with modelled global temperature changes, particularly in tropical or subtropical regions. To our knowledge, no previous peer-reviewed publication has presented such an analysis, which projects changes in heat exposure risk based on thresholds for work and survival, and which contributes to the accumulating evidence of the serious planetary health threats of climate change.</p><p id="para580"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para590">In combination with previous reports, our assessment of health effects highlights the importance of environmental heat for global population health. The heat stress that we have evaluated affects the active adult population in many countries during the hot season, and it is not just restricted to those experiencing extreme heat waves. During the hot season, people are already physically acclimatised and adaptation via air conditioning in residences and workplaces can reduce heat exposure risk. However, it is unlikely that people receiving low incomes will be able to afford efficient cooling systems and many work situations cannot always be protected with such systems. In many cases, those affected by extreme heat will receive greatly reduced income for at least 1 month a year, which will increase the risk of impoverishment. This new evidence on the effects of climate change should inform future policies for the protection of planetary health via mitigation of climate change, highlighting the importance of limiting global temperature increases in line with Paris Agreement targets.</p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design</title><p id="para600">In this modelling study, we analysed the risk of heat exposure in humans at global scales, combining climate change projections for this century (ie, from the recent past [1986&#x02013;2005] to 2100) from several current climate models with existing population projections.

these risks have similar zonal and meridional distributions but show notable expansions in southeast China, the USA, and Australia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="para750">Patterns of heat exposure risk (including moderate and high exposure) for individual models are broadly consistent with mean projections across all models (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>); however, between-model differences highlight the important effects of structural differences and internally generated variability in model projections.</p><p id="para760">The presence of extreme heat exposure in highly populated regions leads to amplified overall risks to workability and survivability. The number of people who are exposed to WBGTs that are greater than the thresholds for workability and survivability will reflect the interactions between regional exposure and population growth. The use of thresholds means that rapid changes in the exposed population can occur in response to natural climate variability and climate change, as we have modelled and as happens in reality. We have separated urban and rural populations to assess these interactions.</p><p id="para770">At a GTC corresponding to a 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C increase, around 350 million people would be exposed to WBGTs exceeding the workability threshold (range 140 million&#x02013;1&#x000b7;5 billion for individual models). For GTCs of approximately 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C, the number of people exposed to WBGTs in excess of the workability threshold approaches 1 billion people in all models (median of 1&#x000b7;4 billion), consistent with highly-populated tropical and subtropical regions experiencing extreme heat stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Urban populations account for most of the increases in median population exposure to the workability threshold at higher GTCs across several models.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Number of people exposed to heat stress above the risks to workability and survivability thresholds at a given change in global mean surface temperature relative to pre-industrial levels</p><p>Data are shown for the effects of an increased global surface temperature on risks to workability, overall (A), and in urban (C) and rural (E) areas, and on risks to survivability, overall (B), and in urban (D) and rural (F) areas. Climate and population data are aggregated by decade and exposure reflects the population at the time a given GTC is reached. The workability threshold is crossed when the maximum monthly mean wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 34&#x000b0;C at the warmest part of the day, and the survivability threshold is crossed when the maximum daily wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 40 &#x000b0;C for 3 consecutive days. Median number of people exposed across the four models is shown for each decade. The median, rather than the mean, is used because it is more representative of the model ensemble, given the relatively small number of models and the large spread among models. Dotted lines are overlaid at an increase in global temperature of 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C and 2&#x000b0;C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="para780">The median population exposure to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold across several models increases as a function of GTC. All models project increases in the number of people exposed to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold of 100 million people or more for some decades as populous low-latitude areas smoothly cross thresholds of persistent extreme heat with increasing GTC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). However, considerable variability exists across models and over decades. Projections based on one model, the GFDL-ESM2M, indicate an increase of about 1 billion people exposed to extreme heat stress that is greater than the workability threshold for GTCs approaching 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C. Consistent with this result, projections with the GFDL-ESM2M model indicate more geographically widespread risks of extreme heat exposure at increases in global temperature of 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C when compared with other models (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This rapid increase mainly arises when the workability threshold is crossed in urban centres of India and Pakistan. At increases in the global temperature exceeding 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C, projections with the GFDL-ESM2M model indicate a smaller increase in total population exposed and a reduction in rural population exposure due to less geographically widespread extreme heat in rural populations of central north India (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This model behaviour indicates that persistent extreme heat across populous areas of south Asia might be strongly modulated by natural climate variability and how that variability is itself affected by climate change.</p><p id="para790">Other models also showed considerable variability over several decades in exposure to the workability threshold in south Asia (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). For example, the total population who would be exposed to WBGTs greater than the workability threshold increases in one decade by more than 500 million people at GTCs above 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C in the projections based on the MIROC5 model, which is attributable largely to climate shifts on the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, even if the GTC increases relatively smoothly, the presence of a threshold in workability means that the population exposed can change suddenly.</p><p id="para800">A smaller proportion of the global population is projected to be exposed to the survivability threshold than the workability threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). According to several models, the exposure to the proposed threshold for survivability of heat stress was not reached in the recent past. From the multi-model median projection, the numbers of people exposed to risks to survivability increases with GTC, to reach around 20 million people globally at warming of about 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C. For a mean global temperature increase across models of 3&#x000b0;C, about 50 million people globally would be exposed to WBGT above the survivability threshold, but with a large model uncertainty. Like the findings for risks to workability, populations exposed to a survivability threshold are predominantly located in urban areas. Projections based on the HadGEM2-ES model indicate non-linear increases in population exposure to WBGT greater than the survivability threshold from about 50 million people at increases of 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C in global temperature to about 140 million people at increases of 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C in global temperature. This abrupt increase in one model is associated with expansion of specific at-risk areas in central Africa (including Chad and Niger) and in highly populated areas of northeastern Pakistan and northern India.</p><p id="para810">Projections with other models indicate smaller increases in population exposure to WBGTs greater than the survivability threshold as a function of the GTC; however, the number of people exposed is largest for GTCs corresponding to increases of more than 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C. With the MIROC5 model, population exposure to heat stress greater than the survivability threshold increases by an order of magnitude to more than 40 million people for increases in global temperature of more than 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C because more populous regions of north Africa are affected. Such associations highlight the sensitivity of threshold behaviours in coupled social-climate systems to projected patterns of population change, particularly in urban areas. All models showed that many millions of people could be exposed to heat stress that exceed thresholds for workability or survivability at increases in global temperature of more than 2&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para820">By use of physiology-based thresholds for workability and survivability under extreme temperatures, we showed that habitability has the potential to be impeded for some subtropical and tropical areas in response to projected climate change. Extreme heat exposure could affect hundreds of millions of people globally in response to GTCs that would meet international targets. These results agree with the conclusions of a previous study<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> that used a different approach and did not directly assess thresholds of the survivability of populations. Non-linear interactions between risk of heat exposure and regional climate variability mean that substantial increases in populations exposed to heat stress above workability and survivability thresholds could occur within a decade. For instance, as highlighted by Rohini and colleagues,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> future changes in the variability of heat waves, particularly on the Indian subcontinent, might occur in response to projected increases in the sea surface temperature in the tropical Indian Ocean and central Pacific. In other tropical and subtropical regions where heat exposure risk is largest, annual variability in summertime WBGT has been shown to be low.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p id="para830">Risks of heat stress are lowest at lower GTCs; the proportion of the population that is likely to be exposed to WBGTs above workability thresholds is greatly reduced if GTCs remain at less than 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C more than pre-industrial levels, at which point the projected population exposure reaches 350 million people (model range 140 million&#x02013;1&#x000b7;5 billion). Risks to survivability are also lowest if GTCs remain at less than 1&#x000b7;5&#x000b0;C above pre-industrial levels, compared with a multi-model mean global temperature increase of approximately 3&#x000b0;C in which about 50 million people would be exposed globally; however, the model uncertainty for the number of people exposed to heat stress that would exceed the survivability threshold was large.</p><p id="para840">Population growth is projected to be highest in the regions at the highest risk of heat exposure (eg, central and west Africa and south and southeast Asia), emphasising the importance of anticipating and preparing for future change with effective adaptation strategies. The largest changes in risks to workability and survivability occur in urban populations, where increases in heat stress could be further amplified by patterns of urbanisation and the associated changes in land use.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Cities tend to be hotter than rural areas through the so-called urban heat island effect, which is not incorporated into these models and which includes heat loading outside buildings and reduced cooling from reduced evaporation. Our estimates of extreme heat exposure are therefore conservative for urban areas in the absence of air conditioning.</p><p id="para850">Reducing people's capacity to work could increase poverty and inequality in some regions by reducing income or increasing risk of death because of pressure to maintain livelihoods. The ability to work will also be impaired to a considerable extent below the applied workability WBGT threshold and the limitations in work capacity will be particularly pronounced for heavy labour. For poor rural communities, it is also possible that subsistence farmers could be exposed to full-sun outdoor heat stress conditions in the future, which are, on average, 3&#x000b0;C WBGT higher than for the shaded conditions that we have estimated (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In these communities, this full-sun exposure could substantially increase impoverishment.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> For affected rural populations, there are few adaptation options because of the need to work outdoors all year and because of the high cost of air conditioning. As such, to combat workplace heat stress in low-income and middle-income countries affected by climate change, new occupational health initiatives and mechanisation will be required.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref></p><p id="para860">Several measures could be implemented to reduce the risks of exposure to temperatures greater than workability and survivability thresholds. Such measures include keeping global temperature increases to the minimum possible and recognising that serious risks scale with the level of warming. The options for local adaptation are restricted to active cooling such as air conditioning or changing the work schedule to the coolest parts of the day or to different seasons, provided that these changes are affordable and practical. Millions of people might have no other adaptation option other than migration, either within the country (seasonally or permanently)<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> or to other countries, particularly when the survivability threshold is exceeded. Anticipating and managing heat stress in hot regions and building on commitments in the Paris Agreement is therefore crucial in responding to climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
