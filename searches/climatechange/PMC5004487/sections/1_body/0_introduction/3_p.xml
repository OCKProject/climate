<p class="p">In the context described above, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. Furthermore, the ability to identify the most suitable crop varieties and practices with the most robust characteristics for withstanding climate change, is crucial for formulating adaptation strategies in this region where farmers are already able to select adapted varieties (e.g., late or early millet) or to adapt their practices (e.g., delayed or early sowing) to a changed environment (Dingkuhn et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, although there is a growing literature on the impact of climate change on crop productivity in Africa, there are large uncertainties in climate change projections, in the response of crops to such changes and in the adaptation of agricultural systems to future climate conditions (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Roudier et al., 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture in West Africa based on the recent scientific literature.
