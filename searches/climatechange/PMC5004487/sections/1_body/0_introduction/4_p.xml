<p class="p">This review is based on a wide review of the literature on climate variability and change in West Africa and associated impacts on crop productivity. Given the sensitivity of the topic, the available literature is vast (more than 200 papers are cited in the references), the review presented here does not claim to be exhaustive and certainly misses many studies. However, an effort has been done to present a selection of the most important results, with a special attention to the recent studies. Moreover, the extensive and coordinated discussion of the crop productivity problem and the related climate dynamics aspects represents the noticeable novelty of this review. Section Climate Change Scenarios of this review paper provides observed evidences of climate change in West Africa and gives some robust features about expected changes in the next decades. Section The Impact on Crop Yield and Potential for Adaptation investigates how such climate changes affect crop production as well as potential for adaptation for the major crops in West Africa. Each section attempts to stress the most robust results in the screened literature but, more importantly, includes a discussion about limitations and uncertainties. The reader is invited to read the cited papers for more details on any specific aspects discussed in this review.</p>
