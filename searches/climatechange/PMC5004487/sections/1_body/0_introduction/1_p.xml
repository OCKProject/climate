<p class="p">Climate has a strong influence on agriculture, considered as the most weather-dependent of all human activities (Hansen, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) with impacts on food security (Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Both variability and change in climate affect food production availability, stability of food supplies, food utilization, access to food and food prices everywhere in the world (Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). It is especially true in Sub-Saharan Africa which is known to be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to a combination of naturally high levels of climate variability, high reliance on rain-fed agriculture and limited economic and institutional capacity to cope with and adapt to climate variability and change (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; MÃ¼ller et al., 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Roudier et al., 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Indeed, under its current climate Sub-Saharan Africa is already facing recurrent food crises and water scarcity triggered or exacerbated by climate variability and extreme events such as droughts, excessive rains and floods which affect agricultural productivity and hence rural household food security (Dilley et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Haile, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). This chronic food insecurity may even increase in the future since the food demand is expected to be multiplied by more than five in Africa by 2050 (Collomb, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>).
