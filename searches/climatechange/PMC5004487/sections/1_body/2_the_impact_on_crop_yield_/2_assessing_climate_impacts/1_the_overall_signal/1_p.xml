<p class="p">Although there is a growing literature on the impact of climate change on crop productivity in tropical regions, it is difficult to provide a consistent assessment of future yield changes because of large uncertainties in regional climate change projections, in the response of crops to environmental change (rainfall, temperature, CO

 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). These uncertainties result in a large spread of crop yield projections indicating a low confidence in future yield projections. As an example of the diversity of yield scenarios that have been produced, Roudier et al. (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) found that the response of crop yield to climate in change in West Africa can vary from −50% to +90% in a selection of 16 publications. This range is even larger in the review made by Müller et al. (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) which showed that projected impacts relative to current African production levels range from −100% to +168%. This range reflects the variety of regions, crops, climate scenarios and models and crop models chosen in the studies.
