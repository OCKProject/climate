<p class="p">If rising atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations directly contributes to climate change, it has the potential to increase crop water productivity by enhancing photosynthesis and reducing leaf-level transpiration of plants (Tubiello et al., 
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Leakey, 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Deryng et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Significant increases of crop yield due to elevated levels of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> have been reported in experiments for different crops (Kimball, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>; Kimball et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) and most of the recent modeling studies simulate the effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Deryng et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of impacts of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization on crop yields in observations and models (Long et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ainsworth et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), especially in Africa where few field observations are unavailable to validate and further improve the models. In particular there is no free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments in Africa. Yet, the impact of higher atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is a major source of uncertainty in crop yield projections (Soussana et al., 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Roudier et al., 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). For instance, by conducting a systematic comparison between yield response to climate change with, or without, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect, Müller et al. (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) found a yield increase of 8% in Africa (percent change in 2046–2055 relative to 1996–2005) with full CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, and a yield loss of −8% without the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect. More recently, Deryng (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that simulated median yield of rain-fed crops in six countries of semi-arid areas (including Senegal and Burkina Faso in West Africa) increases by 4.7 ± 9.6% when including the effects of both climate change and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations while median yield decreases by 4.5 ± 7.3% when excluding the effects of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations. Sultan et al. (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) also found that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization would significantly reduce the negative climate impacts, increasing sorghum yields on average by 10%, and drier regions would have the largest benefits. However, other studies show lower differences between full and no CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization scenarios (Berg et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Overall most studies conclude that benefits of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> will be greater for C3 crops (e.g., soybean, groundnut) which are likely to accumulate more biomass and for C4 crops in arid regions through increased water use efficiency (Berg et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sultan et al., 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Deryng et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, while showing benefits of higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations on water crop productivity, Deryng (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and Sultan et al. (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) both show that it partially offsets the impacts from climate changes especially in the Western part of Africa where yield losses are expected even after accounting for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. Deryng (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found a decrease of crop yield of groundnut, millet, sorghum, and maize in Senegal by the 2030s even when including the effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The author also found a slight increase of crop yield of millet and sorghum in Burkina Faso when including CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> but yield of groundnut and maize decreases. Moreover, even if we can expect benefits from increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on crop productivity, nutritional value may nevertheless be compromised (Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Indeed, a meta-analysis conducted by Myers et al. (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) demonstrated that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization is likely to have adverse effects on the nutritional value of many key food crops by reducing the concentrations of essential minerals and protein with potential serious consequences in food security (Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
