<p class="p">The response of the crop to climate change is subject to uncertainty that can arise from several sources (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In particular, significant differences were found in yield response from process-based vs. statistical models. Knox et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Roudier et al. (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) both found that the dispersion around the mean is greater using process-based crop models. Furthermore, Challinor et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that statistical models predict a greater negative impact of climate on crop yields. The review of Müller et al. (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) based on recent climate change impact assessments (14 quantitative, six qualitative) in Africa also stressed this larger dispersion with projected impacts relative to current production levels range from −84% to +62% in process-based and from −57% to +30% in statistical assessments. The larger dispersion of process-based crop models can be induced by the fact that they incorporate more complex factors in the yield response to climate change (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect, rainfall distribution, extreme temperatures) but also that the lack of sufficient data for accurate calibration and validation (Lobell and Burke, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lobell et al., 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) and site specific parametrization of the crop management options and cultivars (Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) in developing countries such in as Africa increase uncertainty in the crop response. More recently, systematic intercomparison studies of climate change impacts in West Africa were conducted using five process-based crop models (EPIC, GEPIC, LPJ-GUESS, pDSSAT, and PEGASUS; see Deryng, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and two process-based crop models (DSSAT and APSIM in Adiku et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; SARRA-H and APSIM in Sultan et al., 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) using the same forcing climate datasets. They all found a general agreement in the sign of the crop yield response to climate change scenarios while the amplitude of the impact varied strongly across models and simulated crops.
