<p class="p">Important regional differences have been found in the response of crop yield to climate change. Roudier et al. (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) found that cropped areas in the Soudano-Sahelian zone are likely to be more affected by climate change than those located in the Guinean zone. This difference can be explained by the projections of future climate in Africa which show a greater warming over continental Africa (particularly in the Sahel and Sahara) while the temperatures of the Guinean zone, which are influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, are expected to increase more slowly.
