<p class="p">Using simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM), Sultan et al. (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) found a West-East dipole in the impacts of crop yield to climate change in West Africa. Indeed, in broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, their subset of bias-corrected climate models depicted a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger) in the decades of 2031–2060 compared to a baseline of 1961–1990. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, mean crop yield of sorghum decreases by about 16–20% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. This West-East dipole is confirmed by the study of Deryng (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) which uses a set of five global climate models and six different global gridded crop models to assess climate change impacts on crop productivity in semi-arid croplands by the 2030s under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Without including the effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on crop photosynthesis and water demand, the author shows in Senegal, where three over five GCMs simulate drier conditions a median decrease of rainfed crop (−8.5 ± 9.9%) while in the Eastern part of West Africa in Burkina Faso, where four of the five GCMs simulate wetter conditions, the results show a slight decrease (−3.9 ± 4.3%). This dipole was also found in the study of Adiku et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) which used DSSAT and APSIM to simulate climate change impacts on crop yields in two locations in Nioro (Senegal) and Navrongo (Ghana). The effect of climate change was higher in the Senegalese site than in the one in Ghana using both crop simulation models.
