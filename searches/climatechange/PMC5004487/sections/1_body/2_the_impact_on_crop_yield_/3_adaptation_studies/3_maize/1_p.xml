<p class="p">Maize is the most important staple food and accounts for nearly 20% of total calorie intake in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, data). In their meta-analysis, Challinor et al. (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) compared the effect of climate change on maize yields in the Tropics with and without adaptation; adaptation options including changes in planting dates, fertilizer use, irrigation, cultivar or other agronomic options. They concluded that in contrast to what has been published for wheat and rice in the temperate latitudes, there is no effect of adaptation in the Tropics and little evidence for the potential to avoid yield loss in maize yield since the varieties of crop grown are already adapted to high temperatures. Similar results were also found by Deryng et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) who reported substantial yield losses in developing countries located in the Tropics for maize even after allowing for adjustment of planting dates and varieties grown. Using simulations from the GEPIC model in Sub-Saharan Africa, Folberth et al. (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) investigated different intensification options for growing maize under climate change. They found that intensive cultivation is predicted to result in lower yields under future climate conditions and increased soil erosion while eco-intensification shows better yields. However, yield losses are simulated in all management scenarios toward the end of the century suggesting a limited effect of eco-intensification as a sole means of adapting agriculture to climate change. Finally, promising results of rainfall harvesting have been found by Lebel et al. (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) which found that applying this technique to maize cultivation across Africa could mitigate 31% of yield losses attributable to water stress and increase maize yields by 14â€“50% on average under the projected climatic conditions of the 2050s.
