<p class="p">Using the EcoCrop model to investigate the response of important staple food crops for Africa including maize, millets, sorghum, banana, and beans to climate projections by 2030, Jarvis et al. (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) found that cassava reacted very well to the predicted future climate conditions compared to other crops. Whilst most simulated crops in Africa were predicted to experience decreases in overall suitability in Africa, cassava always outperformed or (in the worst case) equaled the average and appeared as a highly resilient staple crop. Crop improvements toward greater drought tolerance and heat tolerance in localized pockets of West Africa and the Sahel could bring some additional benefits.
