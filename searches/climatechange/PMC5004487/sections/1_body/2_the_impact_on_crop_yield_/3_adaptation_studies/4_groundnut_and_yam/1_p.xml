<p class="p">Groundnut is an important crop for Nigeria, southern Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Senegal. Parkes et al. (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) investigated the benefits of breeding cultivars of groundnuts with heat and water stress resistance as well as the potential of marine cloud brightening to reduce the rate of crop failures in West Africa using the GLAM model. The authors found that climate change will increase mean yields of groundnut and reduce the risk of crop failure in West Africa. This projected increase in yields is due to the carbon dioxide fertilization effect also to increased seasonal rainfall in the unique GCM simulation used in this study. Parkes et al. (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) investigated the benefits of breeding cultivars of groundnuts with heat and water stress resistance as well as the potential of marine cloud brightening to reduce the rate of crop failures in West Africa. They found that water stress, rather than heat stress, is the main cause of crop failure in current and future climate and also demonstrated a positive impact of marine cloud brightening.
