<p class="p">Despite large uncertainty, there is a robust conclusion from the above section: agriculture in West Africa is at risk to be negatively affected by climate change. These potential adverse negative climatic changes effects are superimposed on top of high natural variability in seasonal rainfall, which historically has produced large inter-annual variations in rainfall and prolonged droughts (Giannini et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and the recent increase in rainfall intensity and extreme heavy-rainfall events (Panthou et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Both climate variability and trend pose a challenge for the primarily rain-fed agriculture systems in West Africa. Since the 1970's, the largest food crises in Africa that required large-scale external food aid (1974, 1984/1985, 1992, and 2002) have been attributed fully or partially to extreme weather events (Dilley et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Thus, any successful adaptations should be able to cope with the short-term climate variability as well as reduce the negative impacts of climate change in the long term (Saba et al., 
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Lobell, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Hertel and Lobell (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) distinguished between three categories of adaptation: (i) adaptation options based on current technology which can also identified as autonomous adaptation, (ii) adaptation involving a new technologies, and (iii) adaptations involving the institutional environment within which the producer is operating such as markets and policy and resulting from planned adaptation. Adjustments in planting and harvesting dates, varieties of crops to be grown (including combination between crops and cultivars as intercrop or the use of existing varieties more resistant to climate-induced stress), increase planting density and/or fertilizers use, use of crop residue as mulch are examples of options already available to farmers in West Africa to adapt to climate variability and change. Breeding more resilient crop varieties (Rötter et al., 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), advanced breeding methods including more effective root system size, dehydrin genes, phenotyping (Araus et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Setter, 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Vadez et al., 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Amelework et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>); innovating water harvesting techniques (Lebel et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Rockström and Falkenmark, 
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) belong to the second category of adaptation options. In the third category defined by Hertel and Lobell (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), fertilizer subsidies, crop insurances (Berg et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), credits, climate services (access and use of weather and seasonal forecasts; Sultan et al., 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Roudier et al., 
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) are such important changes in the institutional and market environment of West Africa that would affect producer decisions. Assessing various possible adaptation options and their uncertainties is crucial for optimal prioritization of adaptation investments for supporting adaptation strategies in West Africa that may counteract the adverse effects of climate change. However, pointing out the most promising adaptation options remains challenging since there is a large scatter of possible results across locations and situations, indicating the need for a more contextual approach on regional and local scales (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). We will thus give some examples of some recent studies who quantified the potential of adaptation for major crops in West Africa showing sometimes apparent contradictory and crop-specific results.
