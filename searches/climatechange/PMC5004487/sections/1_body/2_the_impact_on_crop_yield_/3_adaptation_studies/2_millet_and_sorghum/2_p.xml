<p class="p">Several studies also investigated new technologies for mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change on millet and sorghum production. Adiku et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) used two crop models DSSAT and APSIM to simulate millet cultivars adapted to future climate conditions. They found positive effects on crop yield whereas the benefits depend on the location, the crop and the climate model used for the simulation. Sultan et al. (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) also found advantages of breeding varieties with higher thermal requirements which can partly counteract the shortening of crop-cycle duration in a warmer climate. Guan et al. (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">in press</xref>) used two crop models APSIM and SARRA-H to assess five possible and realistic adaptation options for the production of sorghum (late sowing, increase planting density and fertilizer use, increasing cultivars' thermal time requirement, water harvesting, and increase resilience to heat stress during the flowering period). They found that most proposed adaptation options are not more beneficial in the future than in the historical climate so that they do not really reduce the climate change impacts. Increased temperature resilience during grain number formation period is the main adaptation that emerges from this study.
