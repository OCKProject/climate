<p class="p">These two crops are among the main staple crops of sub-Saharan West Africa (64% of the total cereal production in 2000; FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref> data). On-farm surveys have shown the dominance of traditional cultivars of sorghum and millet characterized by a strong sensitivity to photoperiod (Traore et al., 
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Photoperiod sensitivity would likely present some advantages in the event of future change in the timing of the rainy season. Indeed, it allows for flowering at the end of the rainy season for a wide range of planting dates and avoids incomplete grain filling, a problem for late maturing varieties faced with water shortage at the end of the rainy season (Dingkuhn et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Furthermore, Sultan et al. (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found that traditional photoperiod-sensitive cultivars are less affected by temperature increase since the photoperiod limits the reduction of the crop duration. On the opposite, adverse impacts of climate change have been found to be the lowest on mean yield and yield variability for photoperiod-insensitive cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes (Sultan et al., 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This result is consistent with the study from Kouressy et al. (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), which demonstrated that potentially high-yielding and photoperiod-insensitive cultivars display an advantage where the rainy season is short. Modeling studies (Turner and Rao, 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sultan et al., 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) suggest that while increasing fertilizer inputs and restoring nutrients imbalance in low-input, smallholder, sorghum farmers of Africa would increase overall food production and have fundamental benefits increasing food security (Vitousek et al., 
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), the trade-off is that it would increase the sensitivity of those systems to climate variability and increase adverse impacts of climate change.
