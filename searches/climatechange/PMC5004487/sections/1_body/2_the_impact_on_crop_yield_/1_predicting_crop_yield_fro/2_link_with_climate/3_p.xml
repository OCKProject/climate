<p class="p">Another important issue which has already been discussed in Section Climate Change Scenarios is the large plausible range of future climate changes at the regional scale of West Africa. Although there are some robust features in climate change scenarios in the region (see Section Climate Change Scenarios), there is a wide spread in current climate model projections of regional rainfall changes over West Africa, especially with respect to summertime rainfall totals (Druyan, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) which are crucial for yields of staple food crops in West Africa (Berg et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Up to now, using the largest number of GCMs from the CMIP5 ensemble of around 36 GCMs remains the best way to represent the range of climate futures in impact assessment. Knox et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) showed that increasing the number of climate models used to force crop models reduces the median range and outliers about the mean change in future yields. Important biases or underestimation of uncertainties can be expected from climate impact assessments based on subsets of CMIP datasets, and similarly from downscaled or bias-corrected datasets (like CORDEX) which are based on a restricted subset of GCMs. This point is illustrated by McSweeney and Jones (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) who investigated how well the widely used Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISI-MIP) subset of five CMIP5 models (see for instance Adiku et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) represent the plausible range of future climate changes. They found that the fraction of the full range of future projections captured by the ISI-MIP subset is sometimes very low depending on the variable, the season and the region especially for summer rainfall and temperatures in the Western part of West Africa (McSweeney and Jones, 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
