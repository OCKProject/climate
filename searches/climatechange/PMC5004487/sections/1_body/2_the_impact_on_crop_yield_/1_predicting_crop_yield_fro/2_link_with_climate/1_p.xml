<p class="p">The use of climate projections from GCMs to force crop models is challenging and raises several important issues. First, combining GCMs and process-based crop models raises a scale mismatch since climate models typically operate on spatial scales much larger than the processes governing the yields at the plot scale and most factors affecting crops such as soil properties and farming practices (Baron et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). To overcome this issue, climate data can be downscaled to the scale of a crop model with two types of downscaling approaches that can be sometimes combined (see for instance Zorita and von Storch, 
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Statistical downscaling relies on the use of empirical relationships between mesoscale and local climate observed variables to relate GCM output to local climate (Zorita and von Storch, 
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). An alternative approach is the use of dynamical downscaling which offers a self-consistent approach that captures fine-scale topographic features and coastal boundaries by using regional climate models (RCMs) with a fine resolution (~10–50 km) nested in the GCM (Paeth et al., 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Glotter et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The use of dynamical downscaling in long-range climate projections has recently increased with the growth of computing resources and large simulations databases of downscaled climate outputs are available for intercomparison and impacts assessment (Glotter et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For instance the international Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment Africa (CORDEX Africa) simulations are now publicly available and used in the literature, including a downscaled subset of GCMs simulations with different RCMs (Diallo et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, although it can improve weather and climate variability (Feser et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Gutmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) as well as crop yield projections (e.g., Mearns et al., 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Adams et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Tsvetsinskaya et al., 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>), it is important to keep in mind that downscaling is an additional source of errors and uncertainties to crop yield projections. For example, when different RCMs were used to downscale atmospheric re-analyses to force the SARRA-H crop model in Senegal, Oettli et al. (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), large differences were found in the simulated sorghum yields depending on the RCM used. More recently, Ramarohetra et al. (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) conducted a sensitivity analysis of the WRF model and found that a change in the physical parameterizations of a single RCM as well as internal variability of the RCM can lead to major changes in the simulation of crop yields of millet and maize in West Africa. As alternative to downscaling, the use of large-area crop modeling has grown in recent years (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Tao et al., 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). This approach offers the possibility of using the outputs from climate models directly in a process-based way, suppressing the needs for downscaling, has grown in the literature (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Several models have been used in West Africa like the GLAM model used to simulate groundnut (Parkes et al., 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) or LPJ-ml (Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) and ORCHIDEE (Berg et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) which are part of Earth System vegetation models in which they account for tropical croplands.
