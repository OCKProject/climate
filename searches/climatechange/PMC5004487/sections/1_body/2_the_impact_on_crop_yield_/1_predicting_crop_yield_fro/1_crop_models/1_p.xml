<p class="p">Predicting the potential impacts of climate change on crop yields requires a model of how crops respond to future conditions induced by anthropogenic climate change, such as: warmer temperatures, more frequent extreme temperatures, possible changes in rainfall mean, seasonality spatial and temporal distribution. In addition, there is a direct impact of atmospheric composition on crops with elevated levels of carbon dioxide acting to increase crop yields through the stimulation of photosynthesis and reduction of drought stress (Tubiello et al., 
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Leakey, 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) while elevated levels of atmospheric ozone which are expected in developing countries like Africa (Royal Society, 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) can lead to yield losses (Van Dingenen et al., 
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Crop models typically simulate the response of the crop to variability and change in weather and climate related to temperature, precipitation and radiation, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). There are numerous crop models with different levels of sophistication (Di Paola et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and several reviews can be found in the literature, describing the concepts and limitations (see for instance Boote et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; White et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Affholder et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Di Paola et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Crop models can be roughly divided into two categories: statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather, such as growing season average temperature and precipitation (Lobell and Burke, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) and process-based crop models which simulate explicitly the main processes of crop growth and development (see for instance Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref> shows a selection of models that have been used to assess the impact of climate change on yields of various crops in West Africa. If the use of process-based models for climate change impact and risk assessment studies has become increasingly important (Tubiello and Ewert, 
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; White et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; RÃ¶tter et al., 
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Angulo et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) since they are able to simulate impacts of climate, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations on bio-physical processes (e.g., phenology, photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and soil evaporation) and other production constraints such as N limitations, these models require extensive input data on cultivar, management, and soil conditions as well as calibration and validation data that are often unavailable in Africa (Lobell and Burke, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Even in the presence of such data these models can be very difficult to calibrate because of a large numbers of uncertain parameters (Iizumi et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Tao et al., 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Furthermore, research effort in crop modeling has focused on the world's major food crops such as wheat, maize, rize, and sorghum and the simulation of crops common in African farming systems (sorghum, millets, yam) is less well developed as well as simulations of crops grown as intercrops across Africa (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; White et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Ensemble modeling including a variety of crop models is thus highly recommended to enable a quantification of the uncertainty (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In this context, extensive model intercomparisons such as the ones conducted throughout the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP;

 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), which includes Sub-Saharan Africa as one of the target region (Adiku et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), are likely to improve substantially the characterization of the threat of crop yield losses and food insecurity due to climate change.
