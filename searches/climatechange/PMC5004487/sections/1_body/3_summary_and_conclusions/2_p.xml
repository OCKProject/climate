<p class="p">The dominant role of the WAM in determining the regional climate is highlighted, and the importance of the global SST in driving the multi-time scales variability is described (Rodr√≠guez-Fonseca et al., 
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In particular, the relationship of the WAM precipitation variability with the tropical ocean SST at the interannual time scales (Rowell, 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Polo et al., 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Losada et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011b</xref>), and with the extratropical ocean SST at multidecadal time scales (Zhang and Delworth, 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ting et al., 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>; Villamayor and Mohino, 
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), is illustrated. The long lasting wet phase characterizing the Sahelian precipitation in the twentieth century up to the 70s, and the following severe drought affecting the Sahel culminating in the 80s, have been related principally to the SST variability associated with the Atlantic multidecadal variability (Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>). At the turn of the twenty-first century, the Sahel experienced a slight recovery of precipitation (Panthou et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Maidment et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sanogo et al., 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), but the attribution of this recovery is still debated. On the one hand, it is attributed to the differential warming between extratropical and tropical SST in the Northern Hemisphere, favoring the northward displacement of the ITCZ (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). On the other hand, the recovery is attributed to the regional radiative warming produced by the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> direct forcing, inducing a thermodynamic feedback on the monsoon system (Dong and Sutton, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The rainfall recovery has been characterized by a modification of the precipitation regime, with higher intensity rainfall events concentrated in less rainy days (Panthou et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, a widespread warming of the North African subcontinent, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes, such as heat waves ad hot summers, has been observed (Fontaine et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Moron et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
