<p class="p">There are many complex processes that drive the response of crop yield to such climate changes. These processes can act in a competing way as we can expect from the role of increased atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration which increase crop yield while warmer mean temperatures are likely to lead to crop yield losses. Such processes can interact together and their importance might depend on the region, the scale and the crop. The complexity of the risk posed by climate change and possible adaptation strategies have called for a number of climate change assessment studies especially in Africa where this risk can severely affect food security and impede development. Despite a large uncertainty in the published results and diverging future projections of summer monsoon rainfall which is key for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges from these studies. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter conditions as predicted in Central Sahel or elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations for C3 crops and C4 crops in the arid zones of the Sahel can partly or totally counteract this effect. On the opposite, yield losses will be the highest for C4 crops in the Soudano-Sahelian zones and in areas where rainfall is expected to decrease like in the Western part of the Sahel. Identifying the most promising adaptation options is even more uncertain since uncertainty about climate impacts is then cumulated with uncertainty about the effectiveness of adaptations. Most adaptation options illustrated in this review are implemented in process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options.
