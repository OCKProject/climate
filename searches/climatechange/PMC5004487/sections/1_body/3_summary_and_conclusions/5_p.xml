<p class="p">Although substantial progress has been made in the assessment of the effect of climate change on crop yield and potential for adaptation in West Africa, large gaps still exist. Important processes like the effect of heat stress or ozone are missing in crop models (Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), most effort on model development and intercomparison are biased toward major crops in temperate regions and the African region generally suffers from a lack of sufficient data for accurate calibration and validation of crop models (Lobell and Burke, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, specific crop management options and cultivars of low intensive systems as mainly found in West Africa (mulching, species mixtures, intercropping and reduced tillage technologies) are not well represented in crop models (Hertel and Lobell, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). If recent progress has been made to quantify the potential for adaptation in integrated assessment and modeling approaches linking biophysical and economic models (Patt et al., 
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), these approaches are built on assumptions which are more appropriate for the high income and developed countries with high adaptive capacity. Hertel and Lobell (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) concludes that they present a risk to underestimate the impacts of climate change in the Tropics and a risk of overstating the efficiency of adaptations in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa.
