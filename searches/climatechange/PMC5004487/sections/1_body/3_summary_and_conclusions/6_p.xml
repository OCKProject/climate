<p class="p">As suggested by Challinor et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), an objective quantification of impacts uncertainty is a necessary step to go beyond syntheses or meta-analyses of published studies with large heterogeneity resulting from inherently uncoordinated studies. Large ensemble of climate simulations, downscaling techniques and crop simulation ensembles including different modeling approaches and sensitivity analyses are necessary for improved understanding of how climate uncertainties and errors propagate into impact estimates, a better quantification of crop model uncertainty as well as a better quantification of downscaling and bias-correction uncertainty (Ramirez-Villegas et al., 
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In this respect, coordinated efforts such as the AgMIP initiative which aims to improve agricultural models including biophysical and socio-economic approaches at various scales and develop common protocols to systematize modeling for the assessment of climate change impacts on crop production represents a promising way toward more robust results (RÃ¶tter, 
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). While they are crucially lacking in Sub-Saharan Africa, observations are also a key to go forward in the quantification of uncertainty and possible reduction of its range. Most modeling work on climate impacts assessment needs quality data to validate and bias-correct climate simulations, calibrate, validate and force crop models or evaluate cropping systems adaptation. Improvement of quality, accessibility of data (including weather, soil, on-farm and experimental crop data, socio-economic data) as well as support for maintaining data over time and collecting long-term time series is of high importance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, if there is evidence that farmers and farming systems are highly resilient to environmental changes, adaptation to climate change needs to be supported and facilitated by governmental, institutional and macro-economic conditions (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Adaptation to climate change cannot be achieved without a considerable institutional and political commitments for technical support or access to credit for instance (Thornton et al., 
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) and many of institutional, economic, informational, and social constraints are still ignored in modeling approaches of adaptation (Hertel and Lobell, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) which need to better account for both the biophysical and socio-economic determinants and specificities of agricultural systems in Africa.
