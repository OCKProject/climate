<p class="p">In the last 15 years, a big effort has been made to understand climate variability and change in West Africa. The African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis program (AMMA;

The AMMA community is still active to provide the underpinning science to assess the impacts of WAM variability on health, water resources, food security and demography in the West African countries, and to define and implement monitoring and prediction strategies (Redelsperger et al.,
