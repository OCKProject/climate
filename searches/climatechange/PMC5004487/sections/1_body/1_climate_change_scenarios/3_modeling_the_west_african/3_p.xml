<p class="p">In the CMIP5 exercise, a specific effort had been devoted to climate prediction at decadal time scales (10â€“30 years), which is recognized as a key planning horizon in a socioeconomic perspective (Doblas-Reyes et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Results demonstrate that the WAM variability at decadal time scales is influenced by both the global SST natural variability and the green-house gases (GHG) external forcing, and the prediction skill is highly model dependent (Gaetani and Mohino, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Martin and Thorncroft, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Otero et al., 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Specifically, highest skill models are characterized by the ability in reproducing the WAM connection with, primarily, the Atlantic multidecadal variability (Gaetani and Mohino, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and, secondly, with the relative SST difference between the subtropical North Atlantic and the tropics and Mediterranean SST (Martin and Thorncroft, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
