<p class="p">After the devastating drought of the 70s–80s, West Africa is nowadays experiencing a partial recovery of precipitation, with a coherent increase in the annual rainfall in the Sahel (29–43 mm/year per decade in the period 1983–2010; Maidment et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This recovery is characterized by a modification of the seasonal cycle, showing a delay of the monsoon retreat in the Sahel (two days per decade in the period 1983–2010; Sanogo et al., 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and by a change in the rainfall regime, showing a decrease in the number of rainy days and an increase in the proportion of annual rainfall associated with extreme events (17% in the period 1970-1990 and 21% in the period 2001–2010; Panthou et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This precipitation recovery is accompanied by a stable rainfall/vegetation trend (Hoscilo et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The recent climate change is also characterized by modifications in terms of atmospheric circulation and surface temperature. The meridional overturning cell associated with the monsoonal circulation is shifted ~1° northward, with changes in the convection belt in West Africa and the subsidence over the Mediterranean region (Fontaine et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011b</xref>). Moreover, an amplified warming of the Sahara desert is detected (Cook and Vizy, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and the Saharan heat low shows an intensification (Lavaysse et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) with reduced desert dust emission in summer (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The origin of this climate change signal in the Sahara region has been related to the direct radiative forcing of the increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (Gaetani et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and to an augmented moisture availability in the lower troposphere over the desert, triggering a water vapor-temperature feedback (Evan et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The changes in the regional atmospheric dynamics accompanies positive temperature anomalies and extremes in spring and summer in the Sahel (Fontaine et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Russo et al., 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Using a network of 90 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> observations in West Africa, Moron et al. (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that the linear trends of annual mean maximum and minimum temperature equal respectively +0.021°C/year and +0.028°C/year.
