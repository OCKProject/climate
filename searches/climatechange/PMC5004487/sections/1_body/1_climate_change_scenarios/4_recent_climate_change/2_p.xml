<p class="p">The debate on the origin of the recent precipitation recovery in West Africa and the associated modifications in the regional atmospheric dynamics is open and heated, and the positions may be conveyed into two main arguments. On the one hand, the recovery is ascribed to the northward migration of the ITCZ in response to the SST warming at end of the twentieth century, which was stronger in the Northern Hemisphere than in Global Tropical Ocean (Park et al.,
