<p class="p">The WAM seasonal cycle is also affected by climate change in the twenty-first century. The projected precipitation increase in the central-eastern Sahel is characterized by a robust increase of the rainfall amounts in September-October (70% of the CMIP5 model runs; Biasutti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This results in a delay of the monsoon withdrawal, with a lengthening of the monsoon season (Monerie et al., 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The moisture transport dominates the water budget change in September, while the local recycling role is prominent in October (Monerie et al., 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Conversely, the drying of the western Sahel appears to be concentrated in June-July in 80% of the CMIP5 model runs (Biasutti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The future modifications in the WAM seasonal cycle are accompanied by coherent changes in the African easterly wave activity, showing a reduction in late spring and early summer and a large increase between July and October, although large differences exists in African easterly wave projections between high- and low-resolution models (Skinner and Diffenbaugh, 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Martin and Thorncroft, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
