<p class="p">High resolution RCMs provide a detailed description of the future climate change in West Africa, generally agreeing with GCMs on the temperature projection in the region. A robust warming is predicted throughout the twenty-first century, although even large differences (more than 1°C) with the driving GCMs exist locally (Laprise et al., 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Dosio and Panitz, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This will be accompanied, in the mid-twenty-first-century, by an increase in the number of heat wave days, by 20–120 days per year over the Sahel, by 20–60 days over Western Sahara, and by 5–40 days over eastern Sahara (Vizy and Cook, 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moreover, half of the CORDEX-Africa projections suggests that heat waves that are unusual under present climate conditions in West Africa, will occur on a regular basis by 2040 under high emission scenarios (Russo et al., 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Finally, in the mid-twenty-first-century, daily maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase, and the daily diurnal temperature range to decrease, by 0.3–1.2°C during boreal spring and fall over West Africa, and by 0.5–1.5°C during boreal summer over the Sahel (Vizy and Cook, 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
