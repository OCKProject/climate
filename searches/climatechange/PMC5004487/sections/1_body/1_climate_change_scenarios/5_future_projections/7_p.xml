<p class="p">Finally, it has been recently pointed out that the projected modification in the atmospheric dynamics over North Africa may impact the Saharan dust emission and atmospheric concentration, leading to a significant negative trend in the twenty-first century (Evan et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Other than on human health in the region, expected to be benefitted, the reduction in dust concentration may have a positive feedback on the monsoonal precipitation, through a reduction in the associated surface cooling and lower troposphere heating, favoring atmospheric instability (Yoshioka et al., 
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Ji et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
