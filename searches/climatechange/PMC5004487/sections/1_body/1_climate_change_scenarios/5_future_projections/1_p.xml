<p class="p">In the CMIP5 exercise, a positive trend in the WAM precipitation results from the multi-model mean in the twenty-first century, though the individual model projections are characterized by a large spread (Biasutti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Indeed, about 50% of the model runs in the CMIP5 archive shows a robust positive trend, about 25% shows a robust decreasing trend, while the trend is negligible in the remaining 25% (Biasutti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In the models predicting wet conditions, these are related to the direct radiative effect of the increase in GHG concentration, leading to local increased evaporation and vertical instability (Hoerling et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Giannini, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). On the contrary, models projecting dry conditions simulate reduced moisture transport and deep convection over land as a response to the global ocean warming, which heats the troposphere and imposes stability (Held et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Caminade and Terray, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, the competition between the response of the land-atmosphere system to the local GHG radiative forcing, and the response mediated through the warming of the global SST, emerges as a key component of the West African climate change (Bony et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gaetani et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), and understanding the relative impact of these two diverse forcings represents a task of primary importance for the climate modeling community.
