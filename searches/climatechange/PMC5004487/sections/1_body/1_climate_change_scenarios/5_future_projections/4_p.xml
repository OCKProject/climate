<p class="p">In contrast to the uncertainties affecting the future projection of the West African rainfall, a broad consensus characterizes the model simulations of the surface temperature for the twenty-first century. The future change in the monsoonal regime will be accompanied by a general warming of the African continent, with a maximum over the Sahara desert, ranging between 3 and 7°C, depending on the model and the emission scenario (Monerie et al.,

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Boreal winter in West Africa will be also affected by a 2–3°C warming, with the strongest anomalies over the Guinea coast (Dike et al.,
