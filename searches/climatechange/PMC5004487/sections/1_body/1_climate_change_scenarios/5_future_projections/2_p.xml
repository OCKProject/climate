<p class="p">The future projection in precipitation simulated by climate models in the twenty-first century is not spatially homogeneous over the Sahel. Indeed, future wet conditions in central-eastern Sahel (east of ~0°E) contrast with dry anomalies over western Sahel (west of ~0°E), and these sub-regional trends are more robust than the trend simulated in the extended Sahelian belt (Monerie et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Biasutti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The rainfall excess expected in central-eastern Sahel is mainly linked to a strengthening and northward shift of the meridional overturning circulation over West Africa, reinforcing the monsoonal flow, with a feedback in the lower levels from the increased temperature and evaporation associated with the GHG radiative forcing (Monerie et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The projected dry spot over western Sahel is associated with a reinforcement of the African easterly jet and modifications in the overturning zonal circulation connecting the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, which result in anomalous subsidence on its descending branch over subtropical North Atlantic (Monerie et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moreover, this east-west anomaly dipole in precipitation is consistent with the recently observed long term intensification of the Saharan heat low (Lavaysse et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The projected rainfall trends result to be gradually enhanced and extended in future scenarios with a global warming of 2–4°C and beyond, showing an approximately linear amplification with no tipping points being reached (James and Washington, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; James et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The twenty-first century evolution of the WAM precipitation simulated by a subset of the CMIP5 models is illustrated in Figure
