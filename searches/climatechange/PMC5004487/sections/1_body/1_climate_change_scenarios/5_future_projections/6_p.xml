<p class="p">The number of dry days is predicted to decrease by 3–7% over central Africa in spring and over eastern Sahel in summer. Conversely, the occurrence of extreme wet days will increase over West Africa by 40–60% (1–4 days) and the southern Sahel by 50–90% (1–4 days), uniformly during boreal summer. The associated changes in extreme wet rainfall intensity show a regional response, including a 30–70% decrease over northern Niger and northeastern Mali, and a 10–25% increase over Senegal, southern Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Nigeria, and southern Chad (Vizy and Cook,

On the one hand, RCMs tend to inherit the biases of the driving GCMs, so that a RCM downscaling several GCMs reproduces the inter-GCM spread, though with a reduced amplitude (Buontempo et al.,

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the other hand, a RCM may project its own trend regardless the inter-model spread of the driving GCMs, due to the differences in the specific physical formulation of RCMs and GCMs (Laprise et al.,
