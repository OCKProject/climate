<p class="p">The WAM is the response to the land-sea thermal contrast triggered by the seasonal cycle of incoming insolation at the surface, which favors the inland penetration of the deep convection associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ; Thorncroft et al., 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In the lower troposphere, the atmospheric circulation is characterized by a southwesterly moist flow from the Gulf of Guinea, contrasting a dry northeasterly flow crossing the Sahara desert. This intertropical front can be regarded as the northern boundary of the WAM, and at the peak of the monsoonal season it is displaced around 20°N (Issa Lélé and Lamb, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In the mid troposphere, the circulation is dominated around 12°N by the African easterly jet, originated by the meridional thermal gradient between the vegetated Guinean coast and the Sahara desert (Thorncroft and Blackburn, 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). The African easterly jet is the wave guide for synoptic disturbances propagating westward along the Guinean coast and the Sahelian belt, known as African easterly waves (Poan et al., 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). These disturbances are particularly important in triggering the monsoonal precipitation through the initiation and organization of mesoscale convective systems and squall lines during the monsoonal season (Cretat et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The annual evolution of the WAM thermodynamic features (moisture fluxes and convergence), and of the associated rainfall distribution, is strongly impacted by the emergence of the Atlantic cold tongue, and the installation of the Saharan heat low. The Atlantic cold tongue is a cold pool which characterizes the equatorial eastern Atlantic Ocean from boreal spring to early summer, and its variability influences the timing of the monsoon onset over the Guinean coast and the intensity of the inland precipitation (Druyan and Fulakeza, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The Saharan heat low is a lower tropospheric thermal depression over the Sahara desert west of 10°E, developing in response to the surface heating over West Africa in boreal summer (Lavaysse et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The Saharan heat low onset is closely linked to the WAM onset in late June, and its variability modulates the longitudinal distribution of the monsoonal precipitation in the Sahel, being strong Saharan heat low phases associated with wet/dry anomalies in eastern/western Sahel (Lavaysse et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>).
