<p class="p">The West African climate is deeply tied to the West African monsoon (WAM) system, which develops in May over the Guinean coast (~5–10°N), reaches the maturity in August in the Sahel (~10–15°N), and finally retreats to the coast in October (Sultan and Janicot, 
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Cook, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), concentrating in this period more than 70% of the annual precipitation in the region (CLIVAR, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The monsoonal rainfall is a key element of the regional climate, especially in the semiarid Sahel, where vegetation is highly sensitive to precipitation variability, at time scales from intraseasonal to interannual (Philippon et al.,

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Taylor, 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Moreover, the atmospheric circulation characterizing the monsoonal system is associated with mineral dust emission (Bou Karam et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and thermal anomalies (Guichard et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Fontaine et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) in the region.
