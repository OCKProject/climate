<p class="p">In the twentieth century, the West African climate has been characterized by the variability of the WAM, showing a succession of long lasting wet and dry periods. This climate variability has been particularly relevant in the Sahel, where a large scale drought during the 70s–80s has been followed by a partial recovery of precipitation at the turn of the twenty-first century (Trenberth et al.,
