<p class="p">The multidecadal variability of the WAM dynamics results from the combination of diverse low frequency global ocean signals (Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>). On the one hand, the warming of the Tropical Ocean, associated with global warming and positive phases of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation, favors dry conditions in the Sahel, through the inhibition of the tropical convection (Bader and Latif, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Villamayor and Mohino, 
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). On the other hand, positive phases of the Atlantic multidecadal variability, by displacing northward the ITCZ, favor precipitation in the Sahel (Zhang and Delworth, 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ting et al., 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The severe drought that affected the Sahel during the 70sâ€“80s has been attributed to a negative Atlantic multidecadal variability phase, concomitant with a positive interdecadal Pacific oscillation phase, in a global warming context (Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>).
