<p class="p">The SST variability in the Tropical Atlantic is the main driver of the monsoonal circulation at the interannual time scales, through the land-sea thermal gradient which influences the meridional displacement of the precipitation belt, with the strongest impact on the Guinean coast (Polo et al., 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Losada et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The Mediterranean Sea plays a role in modulating the interannual variability of the monsoonal precipitation over the Sahel, by feeding the convergence over the Sahel with moisture transported across Sahara (Fontaine et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Gaetani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The WAM interannual variability is also remotely influenced by the SST variability in the Tropical Indian/Pacific Oceans, which may induce stationary waves propagating along the Equator and interacting over the Sahel (Rowell, 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Mohino et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011b</xref>). These regional and remote connections are not stationary and are modulated at decadal and multidecadal time scales (Fontaine et al.,
