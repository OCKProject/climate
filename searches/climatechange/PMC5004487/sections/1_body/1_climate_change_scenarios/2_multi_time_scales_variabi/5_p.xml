<p class="p">Other than to the SST forcing, the West African climate is highly sensitive to land surface conditions and processes. Vegetation-associated land surface processes have in West Africa the largest climate impact worldwide, especially in summer (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), and the Sahel shows the strongest soil moisture/climate coupling (Koster et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). In this context, it has been shown that the vegetation degradation has a role in the drought events in the Sahel, through the increase in albedo and the reduction of evaporation, leading to reduced net radiation and inhibited convection, respectively, which in turn weaken the monsoonal circulation (Xue, 
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>).
