Because of this, the climate is just a natural part of the world that we have to accept and it is not affected by people’s behaviour. Climate change is not related to the burning of fossil fuels, climate is just unpredictable. I’m open to changing my beliefs, but I think the best way of solving any possible environmental problems is by returning to the ways of our ancestors. Things were better when I was younger, and I think that today’s technology plays an important part in the changes we see.

This means that we can also control the climate through technology, and that natural disasters are largely caused by people’s actions. The next generation will be influenced by our behaviour towards nature, but that doesn’t mean we should return to the ways of old.
