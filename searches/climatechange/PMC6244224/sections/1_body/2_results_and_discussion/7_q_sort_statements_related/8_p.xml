<p class="p">Derived from the researchersâ€™ interpretation, it is abductively argued that Q#18, Q#19 and Q#1 are representative of Afro-polychronic TO whereby the present and past constitute a unified timeframe. The attitudes towards Q#18 and Q19 may also support the Heideggerian supposition of 
 <italic class="italic">Vergangenheit Vergesenheit</italic> (the past, forgotten), where the past and present are inseparable (unified timeframe in 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic>) to such a degree that the past should be remembered to suppress the degradation of the present. Supportively, shared experiences in this unified timeframe provide wisdom to be utilised regarding solutions to climate change issues.
