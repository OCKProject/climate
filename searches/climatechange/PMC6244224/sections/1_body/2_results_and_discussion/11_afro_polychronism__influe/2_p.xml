 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic> focuses on a unified past–present orientation, with a near-sighted future view. This temporal view is supported by the respondents’ opinion that the climate was better in the past and that solutions for climate change can be found by returning to the ways (behaviour) of the past. This might provide a challenge when motivating the community to act in the present by evaluating the consequences current actions will have on future climatic changes.
