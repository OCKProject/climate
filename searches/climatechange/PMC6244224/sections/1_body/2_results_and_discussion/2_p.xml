<p class="p">The narrative description of each factor is a shortened version of the Q-sort statements that scored significantly in the factor arrays. Thus, the narrative serves as a description of the worldview or attitudes held by respondents as related to the research topics of beliefs and climate change. Additionally, each identified factor (worldview) is also subjectively labelled by the researchers to facilitate easier distinction between the five factors, for example, Factor 1 – Collectivist or Liberal; Factor 2 – Religious Determinist or Fatalist; Factor 3 – Religious; Factor 4 – Technology or Human; and Factor 5 – Governance or Structural.</p>
