<p class="p">A community’s culture will determine the beliefs of the group as illustrated by the respondent’s statement: ‘You have a culture. And it ends there. You will have to practice your culture. That is what will make you and that’s what is you’ (04-AB-Jouberton). These beliefs will influence the community’s risk perception when faced with climate change; hence, the investigation of cultural beliefs is of importance as a level of risk must be perceived to identify risks before context-specific adaptation strategies can be developed. However, to identify risks, DRR information must be present as the ‘socially influenced risk perception will be subjected to the rational ascribed to preceding hazardous events in order to support the cultural group’s harmony’ (Van Niekerk &amp; Terblanche-Greeff
