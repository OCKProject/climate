 <p class="p">‘What I could say – many people they don’t understand, once you’ve thrown the paper around the field … that causes the climate. Once, maybe you’re burning the fire around the environment you are doing the climate. People are not aware of that. But once, maybe you could take the people and sit down and motivate them to try to learn more about it, maybe it could solve the problem.’ (04-SS-Jouberton)</p>
