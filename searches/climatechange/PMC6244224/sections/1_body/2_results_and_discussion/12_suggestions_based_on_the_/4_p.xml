<p class="p">This quote illustrates that DRR information to raise awareness regarding climate change is identified as a possible solution to motivate change in the community’s behaviour. Based on the recognised need and the fact that a community’s culture will greatly influence risk perception and behavioural change, it is proposed that the community-based disaster risk management approach should be implemented. The participatory nature of this approach will enable the community to become part of the knowledge-sharing process. This approach also promotes the inclusion of the community with regard to the gathering of information pertaining to the specific culture of the community and the climate change risks faced by community members.</p>
