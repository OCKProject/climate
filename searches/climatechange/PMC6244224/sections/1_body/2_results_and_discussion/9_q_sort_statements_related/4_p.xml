<p class="p">The focus of Q#13 is on population growth as a contributor to climatic change and not on the specific actions of groups, which may explain the respondents’ disagreement (F4). The respondents might have been unable to identify with the term 
 <italic class="italic">population</italic> based on the Afro-polychronic collectivistic group orientation whereby members of a group identify as ‘We’. 
 <italic class="italic">Population</italic> might have been interpreted as consisting of various groups, thus enabling the respondents to distance their group from the concept. It might also be that the respondents deem population growth (maybe interpreted as an increase in members of a specific group) as positive as a result of 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic>’s emphasis on quality and timely interpersonal relationships of the ‘We’ group.
