<p class="p">Q#12, 
 <italic class="italic">The climate is affected by the behaviour of people</italic>, focuses on possible anthropogenic actions as contributing to climatic change, with which respondentsâ€™ agreed (F1 and F4). Q#13, 
 <italic class="italic">Increasing population growth causes climate change</italic>, implies that an increase in human population will lead to more human behaviour contributing to climatic change. Interestingly, respondents disagreed with this statement (F4). Based on the aforementioned attitudes towards Q#12 and Q#13, the contradiction is clear: Increasing population growth (which will lead to more anthropogenic behaviour) does not cause climate change regardless of agreement that the climate is affected by anthropogenic behaviour (F4).
