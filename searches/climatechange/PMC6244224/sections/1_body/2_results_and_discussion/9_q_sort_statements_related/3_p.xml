<p class="p">Abductively, the nonspecific nature of the term 
 <italic class="italic">people</italic> in Q#12 might have been interpreted as referring to no particular group of humans. Based on Afro-polychronic collectivism (SSC), the respondents may not identify with the behaviour of people who are not considered part of their communal ‘We’. This may enable the respondents to dissociate themselves from contributors to climatic change.
