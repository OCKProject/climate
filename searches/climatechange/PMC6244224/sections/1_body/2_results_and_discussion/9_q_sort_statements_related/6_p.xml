<p class="p">Q#14, 
 <italic class="italic">Climate change is caused by technology</italic>, states that technology (i.e. scientific advances, modern inventions and optimal industrialised practices) contributes to climate change. Respondents were neutral towards (F1) and in disagreement (F4) with this statement. This might be explained by the reflections some respondents made regarding technology: ‘This is modern technology, cell phones and other things’ (RM-02-Jouberton-P2) and ‘No. How by technology? Because technology is things like phones, and they are not related to the climate’ (IM-02-Jouberton-P2).
