<p class="p">During the semi-structured interviews, automobiles are also mentioned as burners of fossil fuels as supported by the assertion that ‘there are lot of gases coming from a lot of cars’ (02-SS-Ventersdorp). Utilising public transport is common practice in peri-urban areas as a result of the low socio-economic status, which makes it challenging to own private transport. This may help the respondents to dissociate as contributors to climate change because they are not driving the public transport vehicles. The pollutants can, therefore, be regarded as ‘outsiders’ who are not included in the respondents’ group (‘We’) by differentiating public transport passengers from the people accountable for driving or owning public transport vehicles.</p>
