<p class="p">The concept of time orientation (TO) refers to the subjective perspective allocated to temporality. TO denotes the perspective of time in which structure is allocated to temporality based on the subjective attitude of an individual or group (Zimbardo &amp; Boyd 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Cultural TO influences the focus on various time structures, whether it is past, present, future or a combination of these views (Mello, Finan &amp; Worrell 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). A prominent trait of TO is its inseparability from culture as TO is formed by the individual’s or group’s worldviews (Fulmer, Crosby &amp; Gelfand

 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). The meaning allocated to time frames and the relevance of the past, present and future will vary widely as a result of factors such as life experiences, social class, education, religion, familial relations, et cetera.
