<p class="p">In monochronism, time is experienced in a linear manner and can be explained as a line extending from the past timeframe in the direction of the future timeframe (Hall &amp; Hall 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>). This line extension is made up of the parts time is segmented into, for example, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, etc. (Booth 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>). This segmentation facilitates the compartmentalisation and scheduling of time, making it possible for the individual to focus on activities in succession (Hall &amp; Hall 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>). In monochronism, every instance of time can be experienced but once; and time is considered empty and it must be filled with occurrences (Offe 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). Therefore, it is the individualâ€™s responsibility to utilise time wisely and this can be done by controlling and scheduling time.
