<p class="p">From the preceding thematic discussions, it is apparent that TO (specifically polychronism and Mbitiâ€™s African TO) and SSC (relational rationality of 
 <italic class="italic">Ubuntu</italic>) are reciprocal cultural beliefs. The unique temporal orientation (
 <italic class="italic">African time</italic>) and the context-specific polychronism (
 <italic class="italic">Ubuntu</italic>) prominent in the African perspective are interlinked to a degree of inseparability and therefore a synthesised concept, 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic>, is formulated. Additional motivation for the concept formulation stems from the fact that collectivistic polychronism, as found in the African populace, cannot be applied to any other polychronic groups owing to the unique context-specific cultural traits of 
 <italic class="italic">Ubuntu</italic> as rooted in the African perspective. Other polychronic communities may share comparable temporal perspectives with the African perspective, but they may also have cultural qualities that differ from the cultural aspect of 
 <italic class="italic">Ubuntu</italic>.
