 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic> is a TO which focuses on the past and present as a unified timeframe, and limited value is attributed to the future. Here, the future is not entirely ignored; however, events that fall outside of the natural rhythm of nature are only considered and anticipated in the near-sighted future. The past and present are not successive timeframes but rather coexist (like Mbiti’s 
 <italic class="italic">actual time</italic>), and forgetfulness of the past will greatly impact the individual’s present.
