<p class="p">TO and SSC as embedded cultural beliefs found in 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic> create a system of sense-making in reality and the investigation thereof has the potential to clarify behavioural patterns of the group holding this worldview. Cultural beliefs not only influence all human behaviour but also human cognition and perceptions. Therefore, TO and SSC as encapsulated by 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic>, will affect the communityâ€™s structure of reality, and subsequently the risk that will be perceived regarding climate change.
