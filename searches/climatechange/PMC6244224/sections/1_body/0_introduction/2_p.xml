<p class="p">Humans are in essence culturally orientated and a society’s culture is embedded in all social spheres. For this reason, the actions of a community’s members will be determined by its collective cultural beliefs, and such sociocultural traits will greatly influence adaptive behaviour regarding climate change (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wolf 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Cultural beliefs (e.g. time orientation [TO] and social self-construal [SSC]) will affect the manner in which community members identify risks caused by climate change (McNeeley &amp; Lazrus 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Risk identification is important as a level of risk must be perceived to encourage cognition of possible adaptive behaviour and effects (Schwarzer 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>). This is specifically true for disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts as the community’s cultural beliefs will determine whether risks warrant the required adaptive behaviour. Consequently, the lack of justification for actions caused by the level of risk perceived can impede the community’s ability to adapt to climate change (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
