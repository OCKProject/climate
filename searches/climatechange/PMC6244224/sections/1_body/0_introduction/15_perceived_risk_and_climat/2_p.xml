<p class="p">In DRR practices, behavioural changes must be implemented when addressing community vulnerability regarding climate change and this will be dependent on the perceived risk. Risk perception refers to subjective judgement about the felt probability of experiencing hazards when objective information is lacking or minimal (Gierlach, Belscher &amp; Beutler 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Supportively, Dewald Van Niekerk and Aïda Terblanché-Greeff (
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>:4) assert that ‘the assessment of various risks associated with natural and anthropogenic hazards, the likelihood of their occurrence, and the conditions of vulnerability, which could be exploited by such hazardous impacts’ are elemental in DRR. When the likelihood of being influenced by a risk is perceived as limited, the motivation for adaptive behaviour will be absent. Accordingly, some level of risk pertaining to climate change must be perceived to facilitate cognisance of the positive effects of adaptive behaviour. The awareness of the favourable consequences will subsequently motivate the needed behavioural modifications for climate change adaptation (Grothman &amp; Patt
