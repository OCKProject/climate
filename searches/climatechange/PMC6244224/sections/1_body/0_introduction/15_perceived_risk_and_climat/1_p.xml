<p class="p">In the context of DRR and climate change adaptation, the study of cultural beliefs is crucial based on the increased need for glocal action (Lorenzoni &amp; Hulme 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The relation between DRR, culture and risk perception are clear when Aaron Wildavsky and Karl Dake (
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>:42) claim that culture can ‘predict and explain what kind of people will perceive which potential hazards to be how dangerous’. With that being so, cultural beliefs will influence the community’s level of concern regarding climate change (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; McNeeley &amp; Lazrus 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Hence, as cultures differ, it is useful to focus on unique and unfamiliar beliefs when identifying strategies of DRR and climate change adaptation.
