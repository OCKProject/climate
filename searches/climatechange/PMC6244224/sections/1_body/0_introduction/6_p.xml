<p class="p">Neil Adger (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:268) attempts to clarify 
 <italic class="italic">vulnerability</italic> as ‘the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt’. Nonetheless, defining the concept 
 <italic class="italic">vulnerability</italic> is complex as climatic changes, risk, hazards and coping capacities are region-specific, and in various regions and local communities, several groups may have an inclination to be more vulnerable to climatic change and less capable to adapt thereto (O’Brien, Sygna &amp; Haugen 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Therefore, it will be useful to contextually identify vulnerable communities to determine appropriate adaptation capacities, especially when considering that a community’s level of vulnerability and adaptation capacity relate to political, economic and sociocultural milieu (UNICEF
