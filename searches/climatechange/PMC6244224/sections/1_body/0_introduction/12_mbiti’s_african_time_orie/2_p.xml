<p class="p">Mbiti (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>) goes further and elucidates African TO through the concepts 
 <italic class="italic">actual time, potential time</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">no-time</italic>. Based on the cyclical nature of African time, temporality is regarded as the summation of experienced events. The sum of events represents past and present instances, with the flow of time being in a backward direction from present to past. This forms the concept of 
 <italic class="italic">actual time</italic> as defined by Mbiti (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>). Ikechukwu Kanu (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>:130) links the importance of the past and present in African TO with the Heideggerian notion of 
 <italic class="italic">Vergangenheit Vergesenheit</italic> (forgetfulness of the past), and therefore, if the present suffers from the amnesia of the past, ‘there would be the death of sein (being), for its life is inseparable from its past and the forgetfulness of the past leads to the decay of the present’. As such, Mbiti’s (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>) African TO allocates limited importance to future events because of the primary focus on 
 <italic class="italic">actual time</italic> as constituted by past and present events. Nonetheless, even though limited attention is attributed to future events, it is not dismissed in totality.
