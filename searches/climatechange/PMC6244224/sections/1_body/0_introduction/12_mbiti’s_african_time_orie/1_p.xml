<p class="p">John Mbiti is the first African scholar to bring the concept of 
 <italic class="italic">African time</italic> into the academic arena, which he did through his seminal work 
 <italic class="italic">African Religions and Philosophy</italic> (1969). For Mbiti (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>) the dominant African TO has distinctive characteristics that exemplify its contrast to contemporary monochronic TO. Time from the African perspective can be generated by mankind and therefore it is an instrument that can be exploited. Humans are not imperilled or governed by time and temporality cannot be conceived as a commodity. Instead of commodifying time and labelling it in terms of numerical occurrences, the value and significance of time are centred around communal experiences. 
 <italic class="italic">African time</italic> is concrete and cyclical, therefore time renews daily. Time is boundless and based on the 
 <italic class="italic">African time</italic> perspective time cannot ‘run out’.
