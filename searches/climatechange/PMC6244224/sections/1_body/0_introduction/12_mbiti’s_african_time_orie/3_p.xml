<p class="p">Future events are divided and described by two terms: 
 <italic class="italic">potential time</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">no-time</italic>. Unavoidable predictable occurrences that ‘fall in the rhythm of natural phenomena’ delineate 
 <italic class="italic">potential time</italic> (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>:16). Examples of such phenomena are seasonal cycles and climatic changes. In contrast, unknown and indistinct future occurrences that are yet to be experienced cannot be representative of time in the African temporal orientation, and this idea of the future is described as 
 <italic class="italic">no-time</italic>.
