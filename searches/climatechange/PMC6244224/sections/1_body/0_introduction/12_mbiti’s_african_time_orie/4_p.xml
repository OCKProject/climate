<p class="p">At first glance, Mbiti’s African TO appears to be three-dimensional (past, present and future), when, in fact, it is two-dimensional (past and present). This is because of the abstraction that future events (
 <italic class="italic">potential time</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">no-time</italic>) are unable to constitute time as it has not been experienced yet. This limited future view is near-sighted, as ‘future’ can only anticipate (to some degree) by events no more than 2 years into the future.
