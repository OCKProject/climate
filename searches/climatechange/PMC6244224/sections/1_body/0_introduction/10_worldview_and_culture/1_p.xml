<p class="p">The concepts of worldview and culture are interwoven, which becomes evident when these concepts are explained. A worldview is a subjective perception and systematic organisation of reality. Members of a sociocultural group agree on this reality and, subsequently, their beliefs, perspectives and attitudes originate from the established communal worldview (Kraft 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1979</xref>). Similarly, the concept of culture is described as ‘systems of belief and practices that are built upon the implicit assumptions that people make about themselves, about the world around them and about ultimate realities’ (Hiebert 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>:171). As such, the concepts of worldview and culture pertain to how we make sense of the world, which will ultimately influence our being-in-the-world and being-with-others. As the meaning and description of the concepts worldview and culture are similar, the terms will be used interchangeably in the article.
