<p class="p">The research presented was conducted as part of the South Africaâ€“Norway Research Co-operation (SANCOOP) project which focused on subjective beliefs and climate change adaptation. Currently, no research has been conducted where focus is allocated to SSC and TO based on a specific South African perspective. The aim of the research was to investigate the cultural beliefs (specifically TO, and SSC) of three peri-urban communities in the North-West Province of South Africa to determine its impact on climate change adaptation.</p>
