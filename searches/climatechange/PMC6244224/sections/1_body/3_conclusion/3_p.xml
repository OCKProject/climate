<p class="p">In 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic>, the past and present are seen as a unified timeframe, paired with a limited future orientation. Climate change causality and awareness are evaluated and based on this unified timeframe. As adaptation requires the acknowledgement of possible future events caused by anthropogenic behaviour, this near-sighted future orientation limits cognisance thereof. Additionally, the future orientation needed for climate change adaptation might not be prevalent in 
 <italic class="italic">Afro-polychronism</italic> as the future has not been experienced, and thus, cognitive projection into this timeframe is of little value. This lack of focus on possible future situations hampers the communityâ€™s risk perception, which can have dire effects on climate change adaptation.
