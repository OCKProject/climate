<p class="p">Q-methodology does not provide results that can be used as a generalisation and, when considering that culture is context-specific, it is recommended that more Q-studies should be conducted on the multitudinous cultural groups in South Africa to measure beliefs regarding climate change. These cross-cultural studies can be used to investigate and compare how SSC and TO influence climate change adaptation. Subsequently, unique DRR information and adaptive strategies can be tailored for specific cultural communities to motivate ownership of needed behavioural change.</p>
