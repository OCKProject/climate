<p class="p">Q-methodology was implemented for the empirical investigation of the study. William Stephenson (
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1953</xref>) developed Q-methodology to enable the investigation of subjectivity in an objective manner (Ramlo &amp; Newman 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). It is a research method that amalgamates qualitative and quantitative techniques as it ‘encompasses a distinctive set of psychometric and operational principles … conjoined with statistical applications of correlational and factor analytic techniques, (thus providing) researchers with a systematic and rigorously quantitative procedure for examining the subjective components of human behaviour’ (McKeown &amp; Thomas 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:ix). Ultimately, the research method has a quantitative procedure to extract qualitative subjectivity and opinions as communicated through self-reference by the research respondents (Cross

 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Here subjectivity refers to behavioural patterns that form an individual’s perceptions, beliefs, attitude, opinions or point of view in a current situation, for example, perceptions of risk (Stephenson
