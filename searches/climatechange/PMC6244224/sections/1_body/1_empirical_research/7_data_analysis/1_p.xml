<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">PQMethod</italic> software programme (version 2.35) was used for data analysis and provided the statistical results and factor arrays on which interpretations and conclusions are based. During the Q-sort analysis of the data collected for the project, five factors (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app002" class="xref">Appendix 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were produced that representatively demonstrate attitudes regarding climate and cultural beliefs. These five factors account for 58% of the variation in the Q-sort sample. Factor 1 contributes 20% to the variance, Factor 2 contributes 12%, Factors 3 and 4 contribute 10% each and Factor 5 contributes 6%.
