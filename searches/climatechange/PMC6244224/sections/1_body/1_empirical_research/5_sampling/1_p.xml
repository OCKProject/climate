<p class="p">In Q-methodology, participant selection can be based on theoretical or pragmatic considerations (McKeown &amp; Thomas 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Thus, individuals are selected based on their relevance to the studyâ€™s subjective dimensions and goals; or based on availability. As Q-methodology aims to explicate the beliefs and attitudes held by an individual or a specific group of participants, there is no need for large sample sizes (Watts &amp; Stenner 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Subsequently, no effort is needed to ensure statistical representativeness based on respondent traits like age, gender, religion, race, etc. (Du Plessis 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; McKeown &amp; Thomas 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
