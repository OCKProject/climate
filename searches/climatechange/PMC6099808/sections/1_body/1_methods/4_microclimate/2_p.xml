<p class="p">We estimated air temperatures (

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>). Global horizontal solar radiation was calculated as a function of elevation, latitude, and longitude by discounting global extraterrestrial radiation (Campbell &amp; Norman, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Radiation was then partitioned into direct and diffuse components as a function of the atmospheric transmissivity tau [ratio of global horizontal solar radiation at surface and calculated global extraterrestrial (top of atmosphere) horizontal solar radiation] (see Figure
