<p class="p">We integrate microclimate, developmental, biophysical, demographic, and evolutionary models to examine the fitness implications of phenotypic and morphological plasticity (FigureÂ

 <xref rid="eva12618-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). A microclimate model is used to determine the environmental conditions experienced by larvae, pupae, and adults at three sites along an elevational gradient. Body temperatures determine developmental rates and ultimately larval, pupal, and adult phenology. The focal trait, wing absorptivity, is initially determined by elevation differences among sites (genetics) and is also influenced by microclimate due to the plastic effects of developmental (pupal) temperatures. We incorporate microclimate and thermoregulatory traits (including wing absorptivity) into a biophysical model to predict adult body temperature, behavior, and performance. We use a demographic model to relate adult performance to fitness. These fitness estimates allow us to apply a quantitative genetic model to predict phenotypic selection and evolutionary changes in wing absorptivity, and in plasticity of absorptivity, in the next generation. Below we briefly outline each component of the model (more details are provided in the SM and in (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>)), and how the model is then used to predict phenology, plasticity, and fitness across the elevational gradient.
