 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) used this biophysical model together with a demographic model to connect microclimate and thermoregulatory traits to fitness estimates (net reproductive rate; see Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for details). Our fitness estimates are based on 500 females per generation. We simulated a date of adult emergence for each individual using a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 2 days, truncated seven days before and after our estimated date of adult emergence for the year and generation (Tabashnik, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>; Watt et al.,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>). We calculated daily egg production for each female as the product of available flight time (assuming 50% of available time is spent ovipositing) and the rate of oviposition (0.73 eggs/min, as estimated for Colorado 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> (Stanton, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>)). We multiplied daily egg production by the average of hourly viability estimates. We estimated λ by summing over days to either a duration of 5 days, reflecting the mean adult life span in the field (Watt et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>), or reaching a maximum lifetime egg production of 700 (Kingsolver, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>) as the product of survival to maturity, daily survival, and egg production (averaged across the 500 females). In the absence of other information, we assume that juvenile (egg to adult) survival is constant across seasons and elevation in our simulations (see Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). This strong assumption will clearly affect the validity of predictions about absolute mean fitness across seasons and sites, but will not alter our qualitative results about the fitness consequences of developmental plasticity and evolution (see
