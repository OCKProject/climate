<p class="p">Because 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> larvae and pupae typically occur on the shady undersides of leaves on the hostplant, we assumed that larval and pupal temperatures were equal to air temperatures in the sun at plant height (1.8 km = 50 cm; 2.4 and 3.0 km: 20 cm). We used a single sine wave approximation (see

 <italic class="italic">G</italic>) based on daily maximum and minimum temperatures at each site. For the overwintering generation, we estimated when larval development resumes (as the first date with degree‐day accumulation after snowmelt, see above) as well as the onset and completion of pupation. For subsequent generations, we assumed a duration of 7 days from adult emergence to egg laying, and 5 additional days until larvae hatch (Higgins,

Field observations indicate (and our simulations correctly predict) that two generations are completed before overwintering each year at 3.0 km, three generations at 2.4 km, and four (sometimes more) generations at 1.8 km (Tabashnik,
