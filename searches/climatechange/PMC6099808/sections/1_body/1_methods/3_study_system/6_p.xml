 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> adults may be exposed to short intervals of deleteriously high body temperatures (&gt;40째C) even at high elevations, where microclimatic variation can be substantial (Kingsolver &amp; Watt, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). Exposure to such high temperatures can reduce survival and fecundity: Daily heat shocks at 45째C reduce adult lifespan and egg production (Kingsolver &amp; Watt, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). We modeled egg viability as an exponentially decaying function of body temperature from 1 at 40째C to 0.75 at 50째C (Buckley &amp; Kingsolver,
