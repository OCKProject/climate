<p class="p">Because 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> populations and species (including 
 <italic class="italic">C. eriphyle</italic>) are adapted to local climate through differences in solar absorptivity (α) of the posterior ventral hind wings (Ellers &amp; Boggs,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1968</xref>), our analyses here focus on variation, plasticity, and evolution of this trait. Wing solar absorptivity (α = the fraction of incident solar radiative energy that is absorbed by the wing surface) is determined by the relative proportions of pteridine (yellow or orange) and melanic (black) scales and thus spans possible values of 0.4 (all pteridine scales) to 0.7 (all melanic scales) (Kingsolver, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983b</xref>). Two other morphological traits also influence the heat balance and body temperature of a butterfly: the length of setae on the thorax (fur thickness) and diameter of the thorax. We used a fur thickness of 0.82 mm and thorax diameter of 3.6 mm in our analyses, based on measurements for
