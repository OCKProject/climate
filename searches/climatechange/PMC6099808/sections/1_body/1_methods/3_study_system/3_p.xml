<p class="p">We considered three sites spanning elevations of 1.8–3.0 km. Our high‐elevation site (3.0 km, 40.03N, 105.55W) is C1 of the Niwot Ridge LTER (

We examined two additional sites that are part of the National Weather Service Cooperative (COOP) Program: Cochetopa Creek (2.4 km, station 51713, 38.43N, 106.75W) and Montrose No. 2 (1.8 km, station 55722, 38.48N, 107.88W). Weather data were cleaned and filled (McGuire, Nufio, Bowers, &amp; Guralnick, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We averaged snow depth data across our study period at each site and assumed that larvae could resume development once snow melted and temperatures were permissive. We estimated snowmelt as Julian date, J = 20 at 1.8 km and J = 105 at 2.4 km (both 1961–1990 averages of data from the Western Regional Climate Center,
