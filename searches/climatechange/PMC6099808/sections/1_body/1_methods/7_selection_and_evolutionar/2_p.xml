<p class="p">Our microclimate, biophysical, and demographic models allow us to predict the fitness λ of an individual 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> as a function of climate variables and our focal trait solar absorptivity (α). For a given set of weather conditions at a site and time period, the relationship between absorptivity α and fitness λ (the fitness surface) is typically quadratic (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and fitness is greatest at some intermediate, “optimal” value α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub>. At lower values of α, butterflies with values of α below α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub> are less able to achieve body temperatures needed for flight and have less flight and oviposition time, lower egg production and reduced fitness; butterflies with values of α above α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub> experience deleteriously high body temperature more frequently, and have greater mortality, less flight time and egg produce, and hence reduced fitness. Differences in weather conditions among sites and time periods change the value of α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub> and curvature of the fitness surface quadratic (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Variation in absorptivity in a population causes variation in fitness, resulting in phenotypic selection (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).
