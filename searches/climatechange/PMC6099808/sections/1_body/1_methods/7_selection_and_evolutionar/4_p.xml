<p class="p">Our models predict the fitness function relating solar absorptivity α to fitness for a given site and year. Combined with estimates of the phenotypic mean and variance, we estimated the (unstandardized) directional selection gradients β for both α
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>, and used the heritability 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to predict the evolutionary responses to selection in the next generation in these traits (Lande &amp; Arnold, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). Note that the evolutionary response to selection is directly proportional to 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in this model (e.g., letting 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2 </sup>= 0 for trait 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> results in no evolution of plasticity); the simulations we describe in the next section explore how this and other scenarios influence our model predictions (see below).
