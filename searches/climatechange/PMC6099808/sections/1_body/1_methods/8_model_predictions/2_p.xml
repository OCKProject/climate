<p class="p">We used our model simulations to explore three main issues for the three sites along the elevational (climatic) gradient over the past 50 years (1960–2010). First, we considered how developmental temperatures influence seasonal phenology and the temperatures experienced by pupae and adults in each generation. In particular, we compared the effects of varying phenology to those of fixed phenology, in which the timing of each life stage and generation occurs on the same calendar date each year (fixed at the mean predicted date for each stage and generation at the site across years). Second, we explored the effects of developmental plasticity on seasonal patterns of solar absorptivity (wing melanin), and its consequences for variation in selection and mean population fitness. We used these to identify the optimal value of absorptivity (α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub>) and the mean pupal temperature for each generation within a year for each site. The relationship between α
 <sub class="sub">opt</sub> and mean pupal temperature for a given year represents the optimal reaction norm for that year, which we call “perfect plasticity.” We assessed how optimal reaction norms vary among years and sites, and how these compare to the evolving reaction norms predicted by our evolutionary simulations.
