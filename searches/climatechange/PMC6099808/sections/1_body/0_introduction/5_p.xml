<p class="p">We explore these issues using the butterfly 
 <italic class="italic">C.Â eriphyle</italic>, which exhibits population variation in phenology, the number of generations per year, and morphology along elevational gradients in the western United States. Detailed, mechanistic models enable us to predict the fitness implications of a key thermoregulatory trait, wing absorptivity (determined by the proportion of melanic scales), based on environmental conditions (Buckley &amp; Kingsolver, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Wing absorptivity varies among populations due to both adaptive, heritable genetic differences (Ellers &amp; Boggs, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Kingsolver, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983b</xref>) and developmental plasticity, whereby wing absorptivity decreases with increased developmental temperatures. Our modeling in this system predicts that recent climate change has generated selection for decreased mean and increased plasticity in wing absorptivity and that the importance of plasticity varies with elevation (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley,
