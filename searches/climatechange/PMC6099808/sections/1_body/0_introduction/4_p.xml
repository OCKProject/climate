<p class="p">Developmental plasticity in morphological and physiological traits is also central to organisms in seasonal environments, especially for populations that complete multiple generations each year. For example in many insects, thermal conditions for generations emerging in the early spring can be drastically different from those for generations emerging in midsummer, and plastic responses to developmental environments can lead to different phenotypes in different seasonal generations (Brakefield &amp; Larsen,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1969</xref>). However, the extent to which developmental plasticity and evolution are adaptive and influence fitness in variable, seasonal environments is poorly understood. Will their fitness consequences be sufficient to enable populations to track sustained climate changes in the coming decades (Sgro etÂ al.,
