<p class="p">Here we utilize this system to investigate how phenological plasticity interacts with morphological plasticity and evolution to determine seasonal, phenotypic, and fitness consequences of recent climate change for 
 <italic class="italic">C. eriphyle</italic> populations along an elevation gradient. First, how do developmental temperatures influence phenology across the elevational gradient, and what are the consequences for morphological plasticity? Second, how does plasticity alter seasonal and elevational patterns of selection and expression of wing absorptivity? Third, we quantify the fitness consequences of phenology and morphological plasticity and evolution along the gradient, and how these enhance or limit adaptive responses to climate change. By comparing these fitness consequences to those in a best‐case scenario of “perfect” (optimal) plasticity, we also illustrate how unpredictable environmental variability limits adaptive responses to climate change and test the hypothesis that phenological and morphological plasticity will buffer fitness variation in seasonal and unpredictable environments (Merila &amp; Hendry,
