<p class="p">The predicted effects of climate warming on mean absorptivity also vary with elevation in this system. For example at high and midelevations, mean absorptivity declines in both spring and summer generations over the 1960–2010 time period (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), but there is no temporal trend at the low site. These plasticity responses are the result of the increasing pupal temperatures over this time period at the high and middle (but not low) elevation sites (Figure
