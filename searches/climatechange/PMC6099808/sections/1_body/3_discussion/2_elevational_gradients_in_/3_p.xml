<p class="p">Phenological shifts resulting from the temperature dependence of development may limit the effectiveness of plastic responses to climate change (Thackeray et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Phenological tracking can result in early developmental stages experiencing cooler temperatures in warm years (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This may result in cold damage (Boggs &amp; Inouye, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Inouye, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In our system, cooler pupal temperatures in the first generation may lead to increased absorptivity in relatively warmer years; this maladaptive response results from the time lag between the environmental cue (pupal stage) and the selective environment (adult) (Kingsolver &amp; Huey, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Moran, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). More generally, developmental plasticity that evolved in more constant environments prior to accelerating climate change may be maladaptive in the variable environments associated with climate change (Chevin et al.,
