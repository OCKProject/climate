<p class="p">Mean environmental temperatures decline with increasing elevation, and population divergence in thermally adaptive traits along elevational gradients has been widely documented. For organisms with multiple generations per year, however, patterns of climatic variation and adaptation along elevational gradients are less straightforward. Because seasonal temperatures affect developmental rates, populations at lower elevation can reach key life stages earlier, altering both seasonal phenology and the environmental conditions experienced within and across generations. Our simulations for 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> predict that, in the first generation each year, mean pupal temperatures are actually lower at low than at high‐elevation sites, as a result of earlier spring snowmelt and emergence at lower elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This elevational pattern is reversed in subsequent generations. One consequence is that differences in mean pupal temperatures between generations decline with increasing elevation: Thus within years, variation in pupal and adult temperatures is much greater at low than at high elevations (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley,
