<p class="p">A central question is whether plasticity and evolution can improve population fitness in the face of recent and future environmental change and thereby reduce the likelihood of population decline and extinction (Chevin et al.,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). Our simulations address this question for wing melanin in 
 <italic class="italic">Colias</italic> relative to two limiting cases: a constant wing absorptivity, in which absorptivity is not developmentally plastic and does not evolve; and perfect plasticity, in which the optimal absorptivity is achieved every generation in each year (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Even for perfectly adapted populations, there is substantial annual variation in mean fitness at all elevations as a result of seasonal and annual variation in weather. Conversely, constant wing melanin strongly reduces mean population fitness; and the evolution of wing melanin (without plasticity) causes only modest improvements in mean fitness. These results suggest that plasticity rather than evolution alone can make greater contributions to adaptive responses to climate change in this system (Charmantier et al.,
