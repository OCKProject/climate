<p class="p">Our simulations also predict that the adaptive effects of plasticity vary with elevation. At the low and (to a lesser extent) the midelevation sites, plasticity substantially increases mean population fitness (relative to constant wing melanin) and allowing evolution of the reaction norm further increases mean fitness as well as variance at these sites. In contrast, at the high‐elevation site, plasticity and reaction norm evolution have little effect on improving population fitness. Adaptive plasticity at higher elevations is limited by the short active season and by stochastic variation in weather at these sites (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Lack of sufficient genetic variation, environmental unpredictability, and gene flow can also limit evolution of adaptive plasticity, relative to our “perfect plasticity” scenario (Levins,

 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Further simulations in which we increase phenotypic and genetic variance in reaction norms show that even in the absence of genetic constraints, environmental unpredictability strongly limits adaptive plasticity, especially at high elevations (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Collectively, our model results suggest that the predicted contributions of plasticity and evolution for population adaptation to climate change decline with increasing elevation, and that adaptation at higher elevations is strongly limited by climatic variability and unpredictability.
