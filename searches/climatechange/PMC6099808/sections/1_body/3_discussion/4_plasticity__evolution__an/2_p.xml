<p class="p">Our simulations predict that climate change during the past 50 years has differing effects on mean fitness for populations at different elevations: Predicted mean fitness increased in the spring generation at high elevation, but decreased in the summer generation at low elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Our high‐elevation site (3.0 km elevation) is near the upper distributional limit of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eriphyle</italic> in Colorado, and populations are small and widely scattered at these elevations. As a result, recent and future climate warming may increase the upper elevational limits of this species, regardless of its phenological responses. The interannual variation in predicted mean fitness is striking at all sites, especially for the first (spring) generation, and the variation among years is substantially larger than the mean trend over this time period. The effects of variable spring weather on population abundance and fitness have been documented for many temperate and montane butterflies (Boggs &amp; Inouye,
