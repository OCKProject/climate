<p class="p">Surprisingly, varying phenology does not reduce interannual variation in the optimal reaction norms (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). We had expected that varying phenology would generate stronger correlations between pupal and adult conditions and enhance the adaptiveness of developmental plasticity, but our results do not support this expectation. We believe that a key reason for this disconnect between pupal and adult conditions is that adult body temperatures (and flight and fitness) are much more strongly driven by solar radiative conditions and cloud cover than pupal temperatures: In the absence of high solar radiative intensities, butterflies simply cannot achieve the body temperatures needed for active flight, especially at higher elevations (Ellers &amp; Boggs,
