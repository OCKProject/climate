<p class="p">Variation in directional selection on absorptivity among generations and years implies that the optimal reaction norm (the optimal absorptivity as a function of mean pupal temperature across generations for a given year and site) must vary among years (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Interannual variation in the optimal reaction norm is particularly striking at higher elevation: The optimal reaction norm slope varies from strongly negative to strongly positive in some years. At low elevation, the optimal slope is more consistent, but there is variation in the position (optimal α
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>) of the reaction norm. These predicted patterns suggest that pupal temperature is a less accurate predictor of climatic conditions experienced by adults at higher elevations, because of greater stochastic climatic variability and a narrower range of pupal temperatures experienced at higher elevations. The lack of predictable environmental cues in this system limits the evolution of adaptive developmental plasticity at higher elevation (Hoffman,
