<p class="p">The predicted seasonal and temporal patterns of selection on wing absorptivity also vary across the elevational gradient (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In the first generation at the high‐elevation site, directional selection switched from positive (favoring increased absorptivity) to negative (favoring decreased absorptivity) selection over the past 50 years as a result of increasing spring temperatures during this time period (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In contrast at low elevations, our simulations predict consistent positive selection on absorptivity in the first generation, but negative selection during the second and third generations. Despite the influence of adaptive plasticity on mean absorptivity across generations, there remains a consistent seasonal pattern of alternating selection across generations at this site. This suggests that neither phenological nor morphological plasticity is sufficient to match seasonal phenotypes to environmental conditions in this system. Our results also indicate that climate change will generate different patterns of selection and evolution on mean and developmental plasticity of wing melanin at different elevations (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley,
