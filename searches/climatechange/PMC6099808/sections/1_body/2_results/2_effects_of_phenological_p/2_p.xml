<p class="p">The predicted seasonal patterns of emergence vary across life stages, generations, and the three sites along the elevational gradient (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a,d,g). At the high‐elevation site, postdiapause larval and pupal development is delayed by the date of snowmelt and only two generations each year are possible. At middle and lower sites, postdiapause development and adult emergence occur much earlier, and three (or more) generations can occur each year. The duration of larval and pupal development (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, gray shading) decreases as temperatures warm through the season. The predicted date of adult emergence has advanced significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05, linear regression) since 1960 for each generation at the 2.4 km and 3.0 km sites. The relationship is weak due to seasonal and annual variation in temperature. This variation is especially pronounced at the low site, where there is no phenological trend.
