<p class="p">Predicted pupal temperatures at the 3.0 km site have increased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05, linear regression) since 1960 for all generations, regardless of whether phenology varies. The advancing phenology at the 3.0 km sites has not substantially altered the ~2°C increase in pupal temperatures since 1960. Environmental tracking has been more effective at the 2.4 km site: Pupal temperatures have increased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05, linear regression) across all generations when phenology is fixed, but the increase is only significant for the third generation if phenology is variable. Pupal temperatures have not shifted over time at the thermally variable 1.8 km site.
