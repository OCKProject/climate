<p class="p">We next consider how phenological shifts influence predicted pupal temperatures by examining interannual variability (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c,f,i). This addresses whether phenological shifts enable tracking of the thermal niche. Warm years (positive anomaly in pupal temperature at fixed dates) accelerate development and result in pupation occurring earlier. Consequently, pupal temperatures can be cooler (relative to pupal temperatures at the fixed dates) in warm years, which may result in the thermal plasticity of wing melanin being maladaptive. This phenological tracking of the thermal niche is incomplete: Slopes are all shallower than the case of perfect phenological tracking (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c,f,i). The tendency for pupal temperatures to be cool in warm years due to phenological tracking is particularly pronounced at 1.8 km sites. The negative slopes are significant and steep across all generations at 1.8 km (estimates ± 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> by generation: 1st = −0.37 ± 0.07; 2nd = −0.46 ± 0.09; 3rd = −0.44 ± 0.10; all 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, linear regressions). Slopes decline with elevation, but remain significant for the early generations at the 2.4 km (1st = −0.33 ± 0.08; 2nd = −0.35 ± 0.07; all 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001) and 3.0 km (1st = −0.15 ± 0.02; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, linear regressions) sites. At 3.0 km, the second generation exhibits a significant contrary trend because phenological advancements in the first generation are limited by snowmelt at this site, with slightly warmer pupal temperatures in warm years. The cool pupal temperatures in warm years predicted by our simulations illustrate the importance of considering phenological shifts and how they can alter patterns of plasticity and selection on subsequent life stages.
