<p class="p">Variation in phenology generates variation in the predicted mean pupal temperatures experienced each generation at each site (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b,e,h). Unsurprisingly, pupal temperatures are lower for the first than for subsequent generations at each site, and there is substantial annual variability in pupal temperatures at all sites. However, mean pupal temperatures in the first generation actually increase with increasing elevation due to the differences in phenology among sites. There are larger differences in pupal temperature between generations at lower than higher elevation sites.
