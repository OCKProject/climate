<p class="p">We predict that the evolution of plasticity will have variable fitness implications. At the middle elevation site, fitness tends to increase over time relative to the scenario of constant absorptivity for the scenarios that include plasticity and evolution. Evolution of absorptivity (with observed plasticity and including evolution of plasticity) tends to increase fitness over the scenarios of observed plasticity without evolution and evolution of absorptivity. In contrast at the high‚Äêelevation site, the contributions of plasticity, evolution of absorptivity, and evolution of plasticity to increasing mean fitness are variable with predicted fitness fluctuating near zero across time.</p>
