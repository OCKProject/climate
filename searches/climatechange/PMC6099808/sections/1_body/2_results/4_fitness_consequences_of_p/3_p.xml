<p class="p">Finally, we investigate how plasticity, evolution, and phenology alter geometric mean population fitness for each year over the time period 1960–2010. Across all plasticity and evolution scenarios, fitness varies substantially across years due to seasonal and annual variation in environmental conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). We consider the scenarios relative to the case of constant absorptivity (no plasticity nor evolution), which generally (but not always) confers the lowest fitness. We first consider the case of fixed phenology (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b,e,h). Across the elevation gradient, perfect plasticity increases fitness 13.3%–23.3%, with greater augmentation of fitness occurring at lower elevations. At the low elevation site, evolution of absorptivity did not increase fitness in the absence of plasticity. Observed plasticity (both including and omitting evolution of absorptivity) consistently increases fitness.
