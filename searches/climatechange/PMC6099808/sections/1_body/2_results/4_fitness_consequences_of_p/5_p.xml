<p class="p">Phenological shifts generally produce slight increases in predicted relative mean fitness across years but also increase interannual variance. Varying phenology has little influence on relative fitness at the high‐elevation site (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c,f,i). At the midelevation sites, relative fitness is similar among scenarios to the fixed phenology case, but the increase in the fitness advantage relative to constant absorptivity over time is reduced. At the low elevation site, interannual variation is reduced for the scenario of evolution of the mean and plasticity of evolution. This scenario exhibits higher relative fitness over time. These results suggest that adaptation at higher elevations is strongly limited by climatic variability and unpredictability.
