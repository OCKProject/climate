<p class="p">The predicted changes in mean population fitness in each generation reveal several interesting patterns (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c,f,i). First, mean fitness is generally lower in the first than in subsequent generations, especially at the low site. Several predicted temporal trends in fitness are evident: Mean fitness increases over time in the first generation at the high site and decreases over time in the second generation at the low site (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c,f,i). These trends are the consequences of warmer spring conditions at higher elevations, and hotter summer conditions at low elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Second, annual variability in mean fitness is large at all sites, especially in the first generation: Annual variability is larger than the temporal trends in mean fitness. The effects of varying phenology on variance in mean fitness are relatively small in magnitude and inconsistent in direction.
