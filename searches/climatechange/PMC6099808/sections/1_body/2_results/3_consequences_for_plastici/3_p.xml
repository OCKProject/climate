<p class="p">Realized seasonality across the elevation gradient also influences variation in directional selection on absorptivity across generations (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a,d,g). At all sites, cool conditions in the first generation generally select for increased absorptivity (positive directional selection), with substantial interannual variability. Selection during the first generation at the high site shifts from positive to little or negative selection over the time period 1960–2010. In contrast, selection is consistently negative in the second and third generations through this period, especially at the middle and low sites. This suggests that, despite adaptive plasticity in absorptivity, the direction of selection varies consistently between generations in response to seasonal variation, favoring the evolutionary of greater plasticity (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Differences in selection resulting from varying phenology are inconsistent in direction across years (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a,d,g). Overall, varying phenology tends to decrease interannual variance in selection at the low elevation site, with little effect on variance in selection at the mid‐ or high‐elevation sites.
