<p class="p">These patterns of phenology and pupal temperature have important consequences for the predicted patterns of trait expression and selection on wing melanin (solar absorptivity; Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Here we focus on predictions for the case with observed plasticity with no evolution of either mean or plasticity in absorptivity. At the high site, mean absorptivity is high, but the difference in absorptivity between generations is modest. Absorptivity tends to decrease across years due to increases in pupal temperature (Figures

 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Differences in absorptivity among generations are greater at the middle and especially the low site, reflecting greater seasonal variation in pupal temperatures. As a result, the predicted phenotypic consequences of plasticity are greater at lower than at higher elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b,e,h) (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The effects of varying phenology on mean absorptivity are relatively modest and are inconsistent in direction across generations and years (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b,e,h). Overall, varying phenology tends to decrease interannual variance in mean absorptivity at the low elevation site, but has no consistent effect on variance in absorptivity at the mid‐ or high‐elevation sites.
