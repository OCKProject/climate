<p class="p">By finding the absorptivity value that yields the highest fitness in each generation, we can also predict the optimal reaction norm (optimal absorptivity as a function of mean pupal temperature) for each year at each site (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The slopes of the optimal reaction norms are highly variable among years, especially at the higher elevation sites: Indeed in some years, the slope of the optimal reaction norm is positive rather than negative. At the low site, the slopes of the optimal reaction norms are more consistent, but there is substantial variation among years in the position (i.e., α
 <sub class="sub">20</sub>) of the reaction norms (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a,c,e). Importantly, the optimal reaction norms are consistently steeper (more negative slope) than the observed reaction norm (dashed black line), especially at the lower sites. As a result, there is consistent selection for evolutionary increases in the magnitude of developmental plasticity in this system (Kingsolver &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The effects of variable vs fixed phenology on optimal reaction norms are heterogenous, especially at the higher elevation sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12618-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Varying phenology does not have consistent effects on either the slope or position of the optimal reaction norms across years at any of the sites.
