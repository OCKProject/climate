  <p class="p">Predicted seasonal phenology and pupal temperatures across years. Climate and weather differences along the elevation gradient (top row = panels a–c: 3.0 km; middle row = d–f: 2.4 km; bottom row = g–i: 1.8 km) determine phenology and pupal temperatures (dashed lines: fixed phenology, varying phenology: solid lines). First column (panels a, d, g): the mean Julian date of appearance for larvae (orange), pupae (green), and adults (purple; gray shading: pupal duration). The short dashed line depicts the fixed phenology. Second column (panels b, e, h): The annual mean pupal temperature (Tpupal, in °C) during the first (blue), second (orange), and third (red) generations differs between the varying and fixed phenology scenarios. Third column (panels c, f, i): phenological shifts can counter increases in pupal temperatures in warm years. The 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐axis depicts the temperature anomaly each year during the average dates of pupation (i.e., if the average Julian dates for pupation are 150–155, average T for days 150–155 each year – average T for days 150–155 across all years). Thus, positive values indicate that temperatures during the fixed phenology are warmer than average. The 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>‐axis depicts the shift in pupal temperatures resulting from the varying phenology (i.e., Tpupal for varying phenology – Tpupal for fixed phenology). A gray line corresponds to phenology perfectly tracking pupal temperatures (slope = −1). We depict significant (
