The results suggest that positive attitudes, strong altruistic values, strong environmental beliefs and social norms are critical factors influencing visitors’ willingness. Moreover, researchers have found that values affect the strength of goals within the context of a particular environmental issue as well as perceived risk [

 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] used TPB and VBN to explain conservation behaviors and to highlight the differences between the two models. In the TPB, behavioral intention accounted for 95% of conservation behaviors, while in VBN, norms accounted for 64% of conservation behaviors. However, TPB better described the correlations among the variables than VBN. Drawing from the original formulation of the TPB, several studies have supported the precedence of environmental attitudes over environmental behavioral intention [
