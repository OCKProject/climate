<p class="p">The perceived risk of an environmental problem may affect an individual’s willingness to adopt behaviors that are more environmentally friendly. Environmental scientists have found that individuals respond to hazards based on perceived risk and that there exists a significant gap between the public’s perceived risk and their pro-environment behavioral intentions on the issue of GCC [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] because the adverse effects of GCC are not immediately evident and it describes the disconnection that exists between the perceived risks of GCC and cognitive style [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Previous research on perceived risk has found only a weak relationship between environmental attitude and perceived risk across a variety of environmental issues [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Indeed, the public may not grasp the full implications of GCC immediately because the effects of GCC do not immediately manifest and the fact that long-term monitoring of these effects and their impacts on human behavioral intention and activities are required [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] used a linear regression model to explain how the policy making process in Canada copes with climate change and the perceived risks of GCC. Giddens [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and Hutchinson et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] argued that cognitive perception, global public goods and temporal discounting are the main factors influencing the public’s perceived risks of GCC and their pro-environment behavioral intentions. These literatures show that perceived risk is a critical factor affecting pro-environment behavioral intentions. Based on this discussion, the following hypothesis was formed:
