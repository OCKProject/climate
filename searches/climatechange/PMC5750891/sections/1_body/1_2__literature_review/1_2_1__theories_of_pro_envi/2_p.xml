 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] proposed the value-belief-norm theory (VBN), which is another theoretical framework applicable to pro-environmental behavior. The VBN theory includes norm activation theory [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and is related to strength of self-enhancement values—this theory uses more complex causal relationships than the TPB model to explain pro-environment behavioral intentions. These latent variables include ethics, values, beliefs and norms that favor environmental protection [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Steg et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] used the VBN theory to evaluate families’ level of acceptance of energy policies targeting carbon reduction and confirmed that all VBN variables (environmental value, awareness and ascription of responsibility to self-beliefs) affected behaviors, beliefs, norms and adoption. Steg et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] claimed that the strength of normative goals depends on environmental values and situational factors (e.g., biospheric values, situational cues, behavioral costs) that influence the accessibility of sustainability value. As a result, the VBN theory is currently the most widespread model used to investigate the determinants of environmental behavior. Furthermore, the relationships between the latent variables of VBN theory illustrate the effect that environmental values have on individual evaluations of the consequences of environmental behavior.
