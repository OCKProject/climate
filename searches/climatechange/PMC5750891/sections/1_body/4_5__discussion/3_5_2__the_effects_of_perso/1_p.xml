<p class="p">Examining the relationship between the dimensions of Big Five model and GCC related issues bridges connections with the environment and personality on GCC adaptation strategies. A clear and negative relationship was found between the interaction effects of personality traits and sustainability value on the one hand and of personality traits and environmental attitudes on the other. The combination of high levels in particular traits (i.e., strong conscientiousness and agreeableness) with low-scoring sustainability value (i.e., weak materialism and environmentalism) resulted in a negative relationship with pro-environmental attitudes. These results indicate a pro-environmental attitude is not sufficient to improve sustainability value. Alternatively, the combination of low-scoring personality traits with high-scoring sustainability value (i.e., strong materialism and environmentalism) resulted in a positive relationship with pro-environmental attitude. In other words, individuals with low-scoring sustainability value are unlikely to show any improvement in pro-environmental attitudes despite their high levels in particular traits. Only those with high-scoring sustainability value may be expected to develop better and more positive pro-environmental attitudes. We theorize that pro-environmental attitude is both linked to antecedent and moderator variables, the strongest links being conscientiousness and agreeableness. This might explain the link between pro-environmental attitude on GCC issues and the need to incorporate unexpected environmental outcomes in daily life.</p>
