<p class="p">When considering personality traits and social norms, the present study found that positive social norms strengthen pro-environmental attitudes with high levels in particular traits. Conversely, individuals with low-scoring personality traits experience poorer social norms, which negatively affect their pro-environmental attitudes. However, pro-environmental attitudes improved rapidly with increased social norms along a track that was similar to peers with high levels in particular traits. Changes to environmental behaviors are an ongoing activity. All of the following may influence an individualâ€™s personal norms: improvements to sustainable concerns and environmental concerns (e.g., incentives and rewards, product distribution process and raw material transformation), changes in personal beliefs and pro-environmental attitudes (e.g., carbon-reduction habits and friendliness toward the environment), support and commitment from important figures and social norms. This is especially true when influential individuals or groups participate in activities that are designed to help prevent GCC, which introduces a positive image and an improved quality of life.</p>
