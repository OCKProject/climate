<p class="p">After integrating the moderating effects of personality traits, the relationship of environmental concern influenced pro-environment attitudes (−0.586), indicating that the more one cares about ecology and humanity, the fewer preferences (likes or dislikes) one has pro-environmental attitudes. For individuals with low-scoring personality traits, the correlation coefficient of environmental concern on the pro-environmental attitudes was negative, while the scores for pro-environmental attitudes increased steadily with higher scores for environmental concern. In contrast, individuals with high levels of particular traits, regardless of their level of environmental concern, showed better pro-environmental attitudes than their low-scoring peers. This result demonstrates a conflict with the results of Guagnano et al. [

 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Because an individual’s psychology is the starting point for environmental concerns, personality traits may positively moderate the relationship between environmental concern and attitudes.
