<p class="p">Focusing on the factors that affect beliefs and norms, Bamberg and Moser [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] argued that an individualâ€™s social norms are also a type of belief. Therefore, this belief may be integrated into social norms as a predictor of attitudes, beliefs, or behavioral intentions [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. The present study incorporated the references of individuals to society and social groups as measurement questions and did not use the operational definitions of self-identity proposed by Mannetti et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] and White and Hyde [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Social pressure is likely a factor that encourages powerful individuals to engage in consistent pro-environmental behavior and to pressure others to follow this behavior. This reflects the pressure that the social collective consciousness exerts on personal moral responsibility and sentiment [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Roeser [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] and Shackelford [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] contend that the norms of social groups have significant and permanent effects on the boundaries of pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes. The results of the present study are consistent with these previous studies.
