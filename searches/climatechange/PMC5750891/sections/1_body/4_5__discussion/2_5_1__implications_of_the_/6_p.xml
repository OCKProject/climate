However, the results of the present study show the path relationship between pro-environmental attitude and behavioral intention to be significant, which is consistent with the inferred results of previous models for environmental behavior [

The resultant attitudes toward GCC must translate into positive actions such as green consumerism, reduction of carbon emissions and recycling. According to the results of the present study, when undergraduate students adopt an ethic of environmental concern, they abandon past misconceptions, such as the idea that the government and manufacturers are solely responsible to resolve GCC issues. Furthermore, they express greater concern for ecology, support public policies that improve GCC, adopt behavioral intentions to change past consumer behaviors, believe that sustainability values and weaken the influence of materialism and develop a deeper sense of environmental concern and a greater understanding of the perceived risks of GCC.
