In the present study, materialism (0.777) and environmentalism (0.310) significantly affected sustainability value. Therefore, for the participants, sustainability values were mainly the results of materialism and the economic and practical benefits of materialism were higher than those of environmentalism. Participants commonly indicated that they held involuntary self-care for the environment, making it unlikely that the mainstream consciousness of environmentalism (e.g., carbon-reduction and a focus on environmental issues) inspires undergraduate students to adopt a pro-environmental response/action.
