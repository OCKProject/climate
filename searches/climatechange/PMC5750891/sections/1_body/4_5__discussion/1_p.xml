Green education is one of the major adaptation strategies used to encourage a positive public response to GCC [

The behavioral chains of the proposed model included sustainability values, environmental beliefs and social norms and personality traits were the main moderator. The model provides an effective prediction of pro-environment behavioral intention based on the value–attitude–behavior chain that students followed when dealing with GCC issues.
