<p class="p">The establishment of a pro-environmental behavior model could promote GCC adaptation strategies and change opinions about green products and sustainable development. A pro-environmental behavior model can promote a better understanding of the relations among sustainability values, environmental concerns, environmental attitude and behavioral intentions. Specifically, this study introduces a new conceptual framework useful for examining pro-environment behavioral intentions of undergraduate students, which is based on understanding peopleâ€™s beliefs about climate change issues and their attitudes toward making adaptation actions. This model can improve initiatives, sustainable development and environmental education, all of which are necessary for effective action against climate change.</p>
