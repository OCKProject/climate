<p class="p">Global climate change (GCC), a public risk that affects the entire world, is a phenomenon that is mostly attributable to human activity that has occurred over the past century [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. GCC strongly affects multiple factors that influence human and other organisms’ health and survival, including energy resources, space, water, air, food, sanitation and the natural environment [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. People worldwide have been voicing concerns about global warming and a growing number of them have shown a willingness to act on their concerns [

Educators concerned about sustainability hope to understand whether undergraduate students perceive GCC as a risk and what behavioral changes these students are willing in the face of GCC. How people learn to think about sustainability guides their behavioral intentions and behaviors as local and global citizens. For instance, Wright and Wilton [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] conducted in-depth interviews with 37 facility management directors of Canadian universities and found that almost all participants felt that environmental sustainability was a vital part of sustainable development and often mentioned resource use and waste reduction. Barr [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] found that reduction and reuse pro-environmental behaviors were predicted by the individual’s underlying environmental values, knowledge and concern-based variables. Recycling pro-environmental behavior was, in contrast, characterized as a highly normative behavior. Horhota et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] indicated that communication/awareness, inconvenience, financial concerns and lack of engagement are the four key behavioral barriers to sustainable actions. Wachholz et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] demonstrated that most college students express environmental concern about climate change; however, students still hold common misconceptions about the basic causes and consequences of climate change.
