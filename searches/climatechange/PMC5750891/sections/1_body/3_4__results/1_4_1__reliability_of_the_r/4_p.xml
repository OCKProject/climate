<p class="p">The goodness-of-fit (GoF) indicator established by Tenenhaus et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] was used to study the overall fit of the structural models with the analyzed variables. GoF is based on the minimum partial correlation method and uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the parameters. Marcoulides et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] combined the AVE of Fornell and Larcker [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] with the benefits of the GoF indicator to first make improvements to and then to propose new standards for the GoF (poor = 0.1, average = 0.27, good = 0.42). The GoF of the present study was 0.568, which suggests an overall good fit for the model. Furthermore, due to the selection of values related to sustainability value and environmental concern as formative indicators, the structural model had an explanatory power of 1.00, with coefficients of the variables ranging from 0.387 to 0.521. Four of the five main hypothesized paths achieved significance. Considering the effects and interactions of the moderator variables, eight path relations reached significance.
