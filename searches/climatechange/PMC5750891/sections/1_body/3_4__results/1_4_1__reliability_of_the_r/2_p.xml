<p class="p">Along with the formative indicators, the loading capacities of all of the individual test variables exceeded the recommended value of 0.5; therefore, they were considered significant. The coefficients of the loading capacities of the sample factors ranged from 0.696 to 0.956, which corresponds with the value recommended by Hair et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Higher composite reliability (CR) values are associated with higher internal consistency among latent variables. The CR values in the present study ranged from 0.783 to 0.981, which exceed the value of 0.6 recommended by Fornell and Larcker [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], indicating strong internal consistency within the model.
