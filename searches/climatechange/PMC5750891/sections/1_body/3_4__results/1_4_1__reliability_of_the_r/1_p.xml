<p class="p">Anderson and Gerbing [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] suggested that the following two points should be confirmed when analyzing measurement models: (i) the accuracy of the model in measuring latent variables and (ii) the convergent and discriminate validities for the test model. Environmental concerns and personality traits were formative indicators for the proposed model. The reliability indicator of the formative latent variables in this model could not be calculated. To measure the convergent and discriminant validity of the subscale, the other variables were calculated based on the recommendations of Bagozzi and Yi [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The three most common indicators (e.g., individual factor loading, composite reliability, average variance extracted) were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the proposed model (see
