<p class="p">Researchers use either multi-group analysis or the model invariance test to estimate the external validity of a proposed model and to test its stability. The present study used data from 275 valid samples. After the blindfolding function of the SmartPLS analysis tool set the same numbers for the omission distance and research variables, the cross-validated redundancy coefficient (
