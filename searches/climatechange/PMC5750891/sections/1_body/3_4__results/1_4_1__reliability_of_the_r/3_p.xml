<p class="p">Using PLS for analysis, CR and AVE became the reliability and validity indicators for the measurement and structural models. The higher the average variance extracted (AVE), the greater the discriminant and convergent validities are among the latent variables. Fornell and Larcker [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] recommended an AVE above 0.5 and the AVE values of latent variables ranged from 0.510 to 0.910. Although the AVE values of interaction factors did not satisfy the strict convergent validity value (from 0.452 to 0.779), the composite reliability of interaction factors ranged from 0.905 to 0.960, indicating clear discriminant validity among the latent variables of the proposed model. The CR values of all variables in the present study exceeded 0.7, the benchmark AVE, implying that the results of the measurement model exhibited both convergent and discriminant validities.
