<p class="p">We used the PLS method to estimate the important path relationships among the dimensions (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01472-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), with standardized coefficients adopted for each path value. Among the six main effect path relationships, four assumptions reached significance (α = 0.05): social norms on pro-environmental attitude (H2, 0.885), environmental concern on pro-environmental attitude (H3, −0.586), perceived risk on pro-environmental attitude (H4, 0.345) and pro-environmental attitude on behavioral intention (H5, 0.622). The correlation (H1) between sustainability value and pro-environmental attitude achieved insignificance. Mass media is the primary outlet for GCC issues and the connection between media broadcasts and emotional impressions could encourage individuals through social pressure to adopt pro-environmental attitudes and to increase their awareness of GCC. The social norm on pro-environmental attitude path (0.855) indicates that a significant relationship existed between social norms and pro-environmental attitudes. In terms of the perceived risk, perceived risk on pro-environmental attitude path (0.345) associated higher perceived risks of GCC with stronger expressions of pro-environmental attitudes. The pro-environmental attitude on behavioral intention path (0.622) indicates that pro-environmental attitude had a significant and positive impact on behavioral intention. These findings are consistent with the empirical results in Milfont [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], which showed that an individual’s commitment to lessening the impact of GCC reflects positive attitudes.
