<p class="p">The present study demonstrated no significant relationship between sustainability value and pro-environmental attitude, as participants gave very low scores for sustainability values (2.68 out of 7.0). In the context of GCC, the participants earned very high scores (5.57) for pro-environmental attitude, indicating a negative correlation between the two. Thus, the values that students hold regarding sustainability and environmentalism may be correlative. However, significant differences existed between materialism and environmentalism. The present study subsequently set these two different values on sustainability value into a linear combination and found no significant relationship between them. In other words, when students are taught to save environment and pursue sustainability and harmony for future generations, their sustainability-related values (which tend towards materialism) may change, leading them to adopt pro-environmental attitudes that support sustainability and counter the effects of GCC.</p>
