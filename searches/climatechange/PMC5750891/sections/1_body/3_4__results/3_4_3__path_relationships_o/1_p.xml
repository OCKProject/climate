<p class="p">The present study proposed and tested a hybrid and reflective indicator model that used formative indicators including environmental concern, sustainability value and personality traits. The concept of sustainability value covers the impact of human activities on the environment and individual beliefs about the natural ecology, which were categorized as two extremes of pure environmentalism and pure materialism, with greater/lesser degrees positioned between these poles. Sustainability values were linearly constructed with environmentalism (0.310) and materialism (0.777). Most undergraduate students believe that materialism has precedence over environmentalism in terms of their sustainability value and give prior consideration to the economic benefits of human activities and empirical data strongly supports this path relationship. In environmental behavior model, environmental concern encompasses human feelings toward the environment, ecology and other human beings. Ecological concern (0.852) and humane care (0.379) constituted environmental concern. As for the GCC issue of specific environmental beliefs, the present study found that high ecological awareness of general consequences of environmental concern and ecological concern was the primary guide for undergraduate studentsâ€™ environmental concern. This result is consistent with de Groot and Steg [
