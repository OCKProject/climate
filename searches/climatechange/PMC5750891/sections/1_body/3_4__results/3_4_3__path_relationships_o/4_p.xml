<p class="p">With regard to the explanatory power of the connections among perceived risks, beliefs and attitudes, the present study found pro-environmental attitudes were significantly and positively affected by perceived risk and social norms but significantly and negatively by environmental concern. No significant effect was noted for sustainability value. The explanatory power of variation (
