 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] have shown that an individualâ€™s perspective may be mostly described with five personality traits of agreeableness, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness and emotional stability. To highlight explanation degrees and abstraction of latent variables (personality traits), the present study used confirmatory factor analysis to verify stability of personality traits to measure pro-environment attitude. Personality traits were set as the formative indicators to test the stability of predictive variables. Only agreeableness and conscientiousness achieved statistical significance. Conscientiousness had the highest associations with environmental personal traits and the lowest associations for openness.
