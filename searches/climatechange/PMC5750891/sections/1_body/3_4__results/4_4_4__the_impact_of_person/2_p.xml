 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], the present study used factor analysis to categorize measurement variables for personality traits into five latent variables, with the explicit behaviors of an individual constituting these variables. Fraj and Martinez [
 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] and Moody and Hartel [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] demonstrated that a high sense of environmental responsibility increased the likelihood of individuals purchasing environmentally friendly products. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-01472-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the results for moderator hypotheses (H6 to H9). Adding the interaction terms increased the explained variance at step 3 significantly. Integrating the effects of other interactions, no evidence was found that personality traits influence the pro-environmental attitudes (âˆ’0.042). The analytical results reported four moderation effects for the relationship between predictors (sustainability value, social norms, environmental concern and perceived risk) and pro-environmental attitude, which supported all of the hypotheses.
