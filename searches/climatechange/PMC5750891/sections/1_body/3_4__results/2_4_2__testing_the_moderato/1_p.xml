 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] suggested testing the level of significance of the independent variables, moderating variables and interaction effects separately when validating independent variables. Hence, three models were assigned for the transition to the moderating effects of the structural model. The first model included the independent variables and non-effects of interaction (step 1). The second model included the direct effects of the moderator variable (step 2). And the third model included both the moderator variable and the interaction effects (step 3). The present study assessed the interaction effects of the variables based on the recommendations of Chin et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Although questionnaires were used, the characteristics of the structural equation models were considered in establishing the three models based on the aforementioned tri-level concept. Thus, the present study adopted a standardized path coefficient that was based on the proposed model.
