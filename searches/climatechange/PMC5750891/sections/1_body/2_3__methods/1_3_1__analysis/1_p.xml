<p class="p">Partial least squares (PLS) is a statistical method that is used to study or to construct linear models. PLS is able to simultaneously process sets of endogenous and exogenous variables. This study utilized SmartPLS2.0 software (SmartPLS GmbH, BÃ¶nningstedt, Germany) developed by Ringle et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] to analyze both the measurement and structural models. PLS is recognized as an effective analytical technique and is most commonly associated with studies that focus on prediction as an outcome. Academic researchers increasingly use PLS path modeling because of its ability to model latent constructs under conditions of non-normality distribution with small to medium sample sizes [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. PLS has minimal demands on the sample distribution requirements and sample size limitations imposed by other SEM techniques. Petter et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] indicated that PLS analysis is based on the components-based model, whereas LISREL and AMOS models are based on the covariance-based model. The present study used structural equation modeling (SEM) implemented within PLS for data analysis, in order to obtain standard errors and

 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-14-01472" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], was used to examine the moderation effect. To ensure that multicollinearity between predictors and personality traits did not affect the statistic results, each variable was first mean-centered and interaction terms were based on centered scores.
