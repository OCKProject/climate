<p class="p">To ensure appropriate item validity and reliability, three of the items were removed and all of the items were randomly arranged in order to reduce the potential ceiling (or floor) effect, which induces monotonous responses in response to items that are designed to measure the same construct. Three measurement indicators were used to examine the questionnaire items. First, the correlation matrix for all questions was calculated. Any pair of questions with a relatively high degree of correlation (correlation coefficient greater than 0.9) was either combined into a single new question or one of the two questions was eliminated. Next, the top and bottom 25% of the scores comprised the high- and low-scoring groups, respectively. The difference between the mean values of the two groups was defined as the degree of discrimination and measurement variables with a low degree of discrimination were deleted. Finally, we deleted any questions with a commonality below 0.5, as suggested by Hair et al. [
