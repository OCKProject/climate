All of the survey questionnaire items were measured using 7-point Likert scales ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7). Next, a conceptual framework for the study was established. Three scholars examined the research concepts and questions and the instruments were revised according to their feedback. The face and content validity of the instrument was verified based on in-depth interviews with these professionals.
