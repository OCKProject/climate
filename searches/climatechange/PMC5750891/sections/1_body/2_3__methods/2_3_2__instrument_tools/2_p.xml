<p class="p">A questionnaire pretest was conducted to assess the content of the proposed study questionnaire (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-14-01472" class="xref">Appendix A</xref>). The pretest goals included preventing participants from giving false answers or altering their answers due to semantic problems with the questionnaire. Undergraduate students who had taken a course in environmental education during the previous semester took the pretest. This course included at least 18 classroom hours about GCC issues. The pretest was conducted using face-to-face interviews and the participants were allowed to ask questions about the questionnaire at any point, to ensure that the participants had grasped the intentions properly and understood the semantics of the questions. In the first stage, participants answered the questions without any prompts given, although they were permitted to seek clarification on points that they found confusing. The second stage began after the participants had completed the questionnaire. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 84 participants who were currently students at business schools in southern Taiwan. A total of 72 valid questionnaires remained after the deletion of incomplete questionnaires.
