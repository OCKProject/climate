<p class="p">This paper focuses on temperature as a major factor influencing the pollen season with respect to precipitation [

Precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction have an important role in the spreading and amount (concentration) of pollen in the air. However, temperatures higher than normal are able to improve pollen quantity and diffusion, frequently resulting in longer seasons of pollination in many plant species ([
