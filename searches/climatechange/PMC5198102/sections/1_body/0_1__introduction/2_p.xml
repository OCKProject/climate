 <xref rid="B2-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]). The male gametophytic phase has proven to be one of the most temperature-vulnerable stages, often highly sensitive to hot or cold stresses on a short-term basis. Pollen germination and pollen tube growth show acceleration under increasing temperatures (in peach: [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Among the dramatic climate changes, the recent trend towards global warming is overall accepted, and an increase of about 0.6 degrees on mean temperatures since the late 19th century has been acknowledged [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In general, pollen development and fertilization may be the most sensitive reproductive stage to temperature increase and, therefore, the current global warming is recognized as having clear effects on pollen production and fertility.
