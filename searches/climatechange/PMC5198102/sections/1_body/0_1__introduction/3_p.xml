Following this approach, we report on the trend of airborne pollen data from two of the most important botanical families at mid latitudes, Betulaceae and Poaceae. In European countries, they represent large part of the current plant cover as woody (Birch family) and herbaceous (grasses) species. Both the Birch family (
