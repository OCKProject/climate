<p class="p">The paper reports on data collected from one of the first airborne monitoring station located in Italy (at Vignola, MO2). The monitoring station started running in 1989. It has produced only fragmented data in recent years, and it is not working anymore. Therefore, we selected the long interval 1990–2004 during which data had been collected on a continuous basis and for the whole year. The 15-year set of data represents a long series offering the possibility to compare pollen trends and temperatures over a relatively long timespan. Other examples of long series published in the last couple of years are: 16-year period (1994–2009) to predict olive crop production [
