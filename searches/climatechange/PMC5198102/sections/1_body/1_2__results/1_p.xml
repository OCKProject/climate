<p class="p">The trends of the Yearly Pollen Index (YPI) of airborne pollen spread of the two families from 1990â€“2004 show comparable and variable concentrations, with general contrasting patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Below, the general data are reported aiming at introducing the main features of the concentration variability that has been observed in the pollen rain produced by these anemophilous pollen grains in the studied area. They may be paradigmatic of pollen concentration trends under changing weather conditions over 15 years.
