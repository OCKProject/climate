<p class="p">The months composing the pollen season were from late March to early September (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b). In 1994, most of the pollen concentration was especially concentrated at the early period of the season (late March), and in general pollination started in this period during other three years (1997, 2001, 2002). In the other years, the first half of April saw the start of the pollen season.
