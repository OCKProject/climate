<p class="p">Most evident consequences to climate change by reducing the release of pollen in the air are those in 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic>, and especially in 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic>. This study shows that winter-blooming tree species can be phenologically affected by global warming as this phenomenon has caused the increase of autumn temperatures. These trees react by end of the season earlier, and in general by shortening their pollen season. Surprisingly, this occurs in two widespread tree/shrub meso-hygrophilous genera – 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> – that therefore result less warmth-tolerance than other plants such as birch. This is partly in contrast with Central European models built by gridding meteorological/pollen data and by using them as predictor variables to build a model of high 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> pollen concentration levels for spatially continuous areas of 11 cities in Poland [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In that research, the maximum range of the 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> pollen season was 6–150 days of the year, 14–145 days for 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic>, and 35–164 days for 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> (calculated using the 99% method). The model predicts high pollen concentrations for the three genera, only suggesting a proportionally reduced increase of 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic>. Actually, the examination of data from pollen monitoring stations located in the same nation [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] suggests that hazel and alder pollination and the occurrence of airborne pollen vary greatly and are significantly influenced by meteorological conditions. The research introduces several variables, such as presence of locations exposed or sheltered to sun and wind, that have important influence on the pollen season of hazels and alders: for example, a delay in pollination start was observed in quite sunny but very windy sites.
