<p class="p">The 15-year aerobiological data analysis reported from the monitoring station of Vignola shows that trends in pollen production and release are easily identifiable but fairly variable, depending on meteorological variables besides anthropogenic causes. Despite data collection being interrupted about 12 years ago, the interest of these results is still effective as they provide an opportunity to observe phenological responses to temperature changes that had occurred in the considered years, under increasing mean temperature values.</p>
