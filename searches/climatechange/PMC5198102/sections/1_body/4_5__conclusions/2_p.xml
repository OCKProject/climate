<p class="p">The pollen season of Betulaceae, like most of the tree families at middle latitudes, covers the first part of the year, from winter to early summer. The pollen season of Poaceae starts later, principally covering the spring and summer seasons. In our data, the highest YPI and the shortest pollen season of Poaceae occurred in 2003 suggesting that, in general, these phenological events match the presence of average warm temperatures. Poaceae perform a higher pollen production (i.e., high pollen concentration in the air for a short period) as a response to temperature increase.</p>
