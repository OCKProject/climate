<p class="p">Our data refer to mean data from a long series of aerobiological monitoring. Results support that the trends of pollen concentrations have some relationship with variations in temperatures. Probably these results especially reflect local evidence but they also mirror regional responses of plants to climate change. The phenology of 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> seems particularly affected by current global warming, and more than other Betulaceae trees and grasses. These trees have to be particularly taken into account as possible markers of plant responses to climate change.
