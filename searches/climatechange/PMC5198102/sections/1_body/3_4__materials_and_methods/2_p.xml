The daily slides were analysed with a light microscope at 250× magnification (400–1000× for details), and pollen grains were counted along four longitudinal transects. Pollen identification was done through current pollen atlases and keys and the reference pollen collection. Pollen data were elaborated using the softwares GEPO and “Aerobiologia 2.1” [
