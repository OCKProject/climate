<p class="p">Poaceae is a large group including species with different flowering periods, and very different pollen production [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which may result in more than one peak during the grass pollen season. Moreover, there are grasses with long periods of pollination or blooming more than once in the year: e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Poa pratensis</italic> L., smooth or common meadow-grass, from May to July; 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne</italic> L., perennial ryegrass, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers., Bermuda grass, from May to September. According to their nature of herbaceous plants, frequently owing a short-life cycle and growth limits due to the anthropogenic control, Poaceae show more evident (casual) oscillations in the YPI than Betulaceae. Interestingly, the maxima daily concentrations (&gt;1200 p/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) of Poaceae were observed in the years 2000 and 2003 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). In particular, according to a survey by the National Environmental Agency, mean temperatures of the same years had an increase up to +1.38 Â°C in Italy. Moreover, the combination of the highest YPI and the shortest pollen season of Poaceae occurred in 2003. By comparing the analyses from several towns located in Spain [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], some similarities are evident: oscillations of pollen concentration do not follow a clear trend, pollen season never exceeds 200 days, and the maximum value of concentration was reached in 2003.
