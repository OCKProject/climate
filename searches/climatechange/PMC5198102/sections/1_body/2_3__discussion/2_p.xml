<p class="p">Aerobiological data from Betulaceae and Poaceae show that pollen seasons depend on the phenology of the different species included in each family. On one hand, human interference with flowering cycles or plant distribution and growing are common as cutting of trees, mowing of herbs, and garden or park maintenance in urban habitats. They can be responsible for unpredictable anomalies in airborne pollen concentrations. On the other hand, a high number of species is included in these families, obviously influencing trends and the variability of pollen production. The genera and species have variable blooming seasons. For example, among Betulaceae, there are species of 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> blooming in April and others in July–August. In the study region, during the spring period in March–April, spore traps can capture alder airborne pollen from 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus cordata</italic> (Loisel.) Duby, Italian Alder; 
 <italic class="italic">A. glutinosa</italic> (L.) Gaertn., European Alder; and 
 <italic class="italic">A. incana</italic> (L.) Moench, Gray Alder. The latter species blooms until May. Data from the monitoring station of Vignola, here discussed, also systematically showed alder pollen in the air in July and August; this is clearly related to another species, 
 <italic class="italic">A. viridis</italic> (Chaix) DC that does not live in Emilia Romagna. The Green Alder is known to be distributed in Northern Italy, on mountains from the West Piedmont to the East Friuli. This means that its pollen has arrived, and still arrives, from the northern Alps as a long-distance transport with summer air masses [
