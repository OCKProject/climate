<p class="p">Despite the obvious observation that airborne pollen concentration for all species decreases with precipitation, and pollen concentration is low/insignificant in a day with rain or the day after (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]), most research points to the main significance of temperature for pollination. An 18 year long-term study (1989â€“2006) on the characterization of the male flowering and pollen flow of birch in Finland-northern Europe was carried out to understand the proximal causes contributing to pollination, and the annual variability and spatial synchronization of male catkin numbers of silver birch (

 <italic class="italic">Betula pubescens</italic> Ehrn.). The research demonstrated that there is no correlation between catkin numbers, annual airborne pollen sums, and the amount of precipitation during the pollination season [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-05-00042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Indeed, studies report on the correlation between temperatures and pollen seasons where different tree species give different responses to climate change. The focus has commonly been directed to the start of pollination.
