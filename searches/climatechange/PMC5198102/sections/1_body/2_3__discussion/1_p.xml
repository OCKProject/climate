<p class="p">Aerobiological data can explain unpredictable annual variability of concentrations over the years but cannot be fully responsible for the increasing trend of Betulaceae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a) versus the decreasing trend of Poaceae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b). In general, the monthly trends and concentrations follow patterns that are typical and repeated after a seasonal basis. Thus, the Betulaceae pollen season is January–July with acme in April whilst the Poaceae pollen season is March–September with acme in May (
