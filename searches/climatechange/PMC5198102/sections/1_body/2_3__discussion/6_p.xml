<p class="p">In general, the pollen season of Betulaceae ranges between 140 and 200 days in different years. The Birch family tends to decrease the number of days with pollen in the air but important distinctions were observed among the genera. 
 <italic class="italic">Ostrya</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Carpinus</italic> had a quite steady duration of the pollen season, while the number of days with pollen tends to increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> and to decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-05-00042-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). For example, there is a slight increasing trend of 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> from 56 to 58 days with pollen in the air, passing from the 1990–1995 interval to the 1996–2004 interval. The duration of the pollen season of 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> decreases from 160 in 1990–1995 to 150 days in 1996–2004. 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> pollen season ranges as mean from 97 days in 1990–1995 to 75 days in the years 1996–2004. Interestingly, there are signs that a similar behavior characterized the way the pollen seasons changed. All the genera show a tendency to maintain almost steady pollination in the early days of the pollination season all over the years. Conversely, the end days show important differences: they pass from a delay of about 2 days for 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> (corresponding to an increase of 3.5% of the number of days with 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> pollen in the air), to a reduction of about 10 days in 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> (decrease of 6.5%), and of about 22 days in 
 <italic class="italic">Corylus</italic> (decrease of 25.6%;
