<p id="Par31" class="p">Punta Prieta is a designated marine reserve that allowed us to get an initial understanding of how physical variables would influence juvenile abalone performance if the local fishing community implemented a restocking program in a marine reserve. The mortality differences at the shallow versus deeper site only ~200 meters away effectively demonstrated the need for further understanding of local scale dynamics in predicting climate change impacts. Despite the conditions at the shallow site being favorable, as indicated by both traditional knowledge and the lack of hypoxic events in this area, other local conditions are clearly driving the survivorship of juvenile abalone at this shallow site. In contrast to the shallow site, the deeper site within the Punta Prieta reserve had the highest survivorship in both years. An alternative explanation to direct physical forcing as the causative agent may be that some sites are driven by the physical conditions that favor disease or algal blooms that are harmful to abalone

Although we have not presented evidence for such indirect effects, our results highlight the importance of understanding how large-scale forcing manifest at the local spatial scales and the key factors (e.g. low dissolved oxygen exposure along with other possible covariates) that may be negatively influencing recruitment.
