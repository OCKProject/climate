<p id="Par5" class="p">We hypothesized that exposure to low dissolved oxygen levels that are typically associated with upwelling events would have negative impacts on growth and mortality. However, it is difficult to make predictions regarding the effects of low dissolved oxygen combined with higher temperatures on growth and mortality due to the limited knowledge of the effects of these covariates. We hypothesized that the combined exposure to low dissolved oxygen and high temperatures was likely to have a negative influence on growth and survival because high temperatures can increase metabolic rates and oxygen demand, thereby possibly exacerbating the impacts of low oxygen conditions.</p>
