 </sup>. However, despite the understanding that temperature and dissolved oxygen play major roles in both growth and mortality, the contribution of temperature stress as it co-varies with low oxygen remains unclear. For example, low levels of dissolved oxygen can sequentially occur with high temperatures in nearshore systems due to eutrophication, changes in EÑSO, mixed layer dynamics, and wind forcing

 </sup>. Such dynamics can vary widely over relatively small distances (100–1000 s of m). Despite the global predictions for warming oceans and increased low dissolved oxygen waters in nearshore systems, understanding how large-scale phenomena manifest and affect biological processes at the local spatial scales remains largely limited to inference from laboratory investigations without consideration of local oceanographic variability.
