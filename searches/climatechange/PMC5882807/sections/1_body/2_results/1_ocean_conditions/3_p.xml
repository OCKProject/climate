<p id="Par22" class="p">At the local scale, temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations varied greatly between years, among sites, and through time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Exposure to extreme temperature and oxygen conditions ultimately varied between all sites and over years based on temperature and oxygen indices (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Temperatures during the field experiments were overall lower in 2013 versus 2014 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In 2014, temperatures gradually increased during the month of August, and remained high (ave. = 23.77 +/− 1.33 °C, max = 26.04 °C) through late August and September (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). In both years, temperatures were up to 2 °C higher on the Vizcaino Bay side compared to the open Pacific side of the island during the first 2 weeks of the experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,d</xref>). This was particularly evident at the shallow site (PP7m) in 2013, where, coinciding with juvenile mass mortality, seawater temperatures remained continuously above 20 °C for up to 23 hours, as opposed to only 2–3 hours at the deeper site (PP12m). Dissolved oxygen levels were high throughout the 2013 experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Hypoxic conditions, which may result in sub-lethal or lethal effects on benthic marine organisms (DO &lt; 4.6 and 2 mg/l, respectively)

 </sup>, were not observed at the field sites during the 2013 experiment. In contrast, low DO conditions occurred at all sites in 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). DO concentrations lower than 4.6 mg/l persisted for over one week at the cold-deep site in July, and concentrations as low as 1.5–2 mg/l were observed at both the shallow and deep sites for short periods of time (2–4 hours).
