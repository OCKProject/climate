<p id="Par21" class="p">During the 2013 experiment, ocean conditions at Morro Prieto largely followed patterns associated with wind-driven upwelling with little diurnal and tidal variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,c</xref>). In contrast, Punta Prieta conditions exhibited patterns associated with upwelling, but also maintained high variability associated with internal tides (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,c</xref>). While both sites experienced extreme warming during 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>), Punta Prieta maintained high daily and tidal temperature and oxygen variability during both years. Increased warming and relatively similar overall upwelling also led to different dissolved oxygen dynamics between 2013 and 2014. In 2013, stratification was lower, waters remained well ventilated, and no low oxygen events were observed at any of the experimental locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). In 2014, warmer surface waters combined with upwelling led to increased stratification and the occurrence of several low oxygen events at both sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>). Despite these similarities between sites across years, internal tidal motions at Punta Prieta led to shorter exposure to low oxygen where sites were intermittently exposed to oxygenated surface waters when low oxygen was present at depth. These records illustrate surprisingly variable conditions at scales of 100 s to 1000 s of meters that persist in the presence of strong global forcing.
