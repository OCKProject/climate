 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5a</xref>), the first samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>, SP 1) of cell viability taken from the juvenile abalone indicated that the proportion of non-viable hemocytes were significantly higher relative to the proportion of non-viable hemocytes as measured from juvenile abalone exposed to ambient temperature conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, p &lt; 0.001). After an additional 24-hour exposure to a secondary temperature ramp to ~27 °C, a second measure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>, SP 2) of cell viability indicated that the proportion of non-viable hemocytes remained significantly higher under elevated temperatures versus ambient conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, p &lt; 0.001). A similar ramp in temperature treatments from 23 to 27.5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5b,c</xref>, Ramp 2b, SP 3) also resulted in significantly higher proportion of non-viable hemocytes in the juvenile abalone versus those abalone exposed to ambient conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, p &lt; 0.001).
