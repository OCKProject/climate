<p id="Par24" class="p">Mortality varied among sites and through time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Mortality during the first 3 weeks of deployment was highest among sites in 2013, with near 100% mortality at the Punta Prieta shallow site but not at the other locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). After this initial localized mass mortality event, mortality was low at the remaining sites throughout the experiment (between 0–3% weekly; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Mortality was overall greater but steadier throughout the experiment in 2014 compared to 2013, at all sites (between 0–30% weekly; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). After 8 weeks, 76% (±16.32%) of the juveniles survived in 2013 at the sites unaffected by mass mortality, but only 20.94% (±6.63%) survived in 2014. Proportional mortality had a small but significant negative response to increases in exposure to high temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2B</xref>). In contrast, proportional mortality had a large and positive response to increased exposure to low DO (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2B</xref>). However, the GLMM analysis indicates a significant interactive effect between TI and OI where temperature imposed a mild recovery on the effects of low oxygen alone (

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2B</xref>). Mortality was virtually non-existent in the laboratory samples (n = 2 out of 80 abalone over 8 weeks) in 2014 despite high mortality rates observed in the field sites.
