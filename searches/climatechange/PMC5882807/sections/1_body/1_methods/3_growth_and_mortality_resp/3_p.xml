<p id="Par14" class="p">To quantify the mean changes in shell size as an indicator of growth, we took photographs of each replicate abalone group 1 day prior to deployment (Size
 <sub class="sub">Initial</sub>) and on the final day of the experiment (Size
 <sub class="sub">Final</sub>). To minimize handling stress and processing time, replicate groups of animals were placed on a waterproof paper with a 16 cm × 16 cm grid, dabbed dried with tissue paper to remove water distortion, photographed with a Canon S10 Powershot camera (Canon USA Inc.) mounted on a tripod, and immediately placed back in flow-through tanks. We post-processed each of the images using ImageJ software (

To minimize camera lens distortion of the image, 1 cm section of the reference grid immediately next to each juvenile abalone was used to set the image scale. Once the scale was defined in ImageJ, abalone shell diameter was then estimated using the ruler tool. To estimate individual growth, Size
 <sub class="sub">Initial</sub> was subtracted from Size
 <sub class="sub">Final</sub> after visually confirming the unique color and banding patterns on the surface of the shell at the two different time points (Fig.
