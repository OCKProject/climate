<p id="Par17" class="p">To assess sub-lethal stress after temperature ramp exposure to the juvenile abalone, we used 1 ml sterile syringes to immediately extract a sample of hemolymph, the ‘blood’ of abalone, from the middle of each abalone foot (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10–12 abalone from each treatment group). Cells with structurally compromised membranes are ‘leaky’ and thus any hemocytes damaged by temperature stress are likely to take up tracer dyes—e.g., Trypan Blue—whereas healthy intact cells would prevent the dye from diffusing into the cytoplasm. This method of assessing non-viable and viable hemocytes has previously been used to assess sub-lethal stress in other invertebrates

 </sup>. After extraction and placement of 1 ml of hemolymph in a 2 ml centrifuge tube, 10 ul of anti-coagulant (Alsever’s Solution, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added to the hemolymph and the cell solution aspirated using a 100 ul pipetman. Cell viability of all the samples was then evaluated by the addition of 50 ul of Trypan Blue to each sample followed by loading a 10 ul sub-sample of the cell suspension on a hemocytometer, and manually counting both the cells that were dark blue (non-viable) and clear (viable) as viewed through a 10x magnification on a compound microscope (Lieder MC-100, American Scientific, USA). To standardize the number of cells to be counted, we sub-sampled four of the counting squares on the hemocytomer that gave a reasonable estimate of the total number of cells per volume of cell suspension. For each abalone hemolymph samples, we counted &gt;200 total cells on the hemocytometer. Additionally, we determined whether juvenile abalone behavior was affected by the temperature ramps by placing individuals in a plastic petri dish for 1 minute, prior to hemolymph sampling, and recording how many animals moved within that time frame versus how many did not exhibit any activity.
