<p id="Par16" class="p">We also conducted controlled temperature ramp experiments on juvenile abalone in the laboratory to inform interpretation of our field experiments. In these experiments, we used a thermo-coupled seawater temperature control system

 </sup>. Although dissolved oxygen was not monitored with this system, ambient air bubbling via aquarium air pump and air stones were included in the experimental tanks to keep the seawater saturated with respect to dissolved oxygen as described in

 </sup>. In two experimental tanks, juvenile abalone from the Isla Natividad aquaculture facility were exposed to conditions mimicking multiple 5 °C temperature ramp events for 24- and 48-hour periods. These temperature changes were measured during the 2013 field experiment, coinciding with high abalone mortality at one of the field sites (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We exposed a group of juvenile abalone to ambient temperature conditions for comparison (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5a,b</xref> for temperature series of ambient and treatment). Twenty-four animals were assigned to each group (treatment and ambient), and n = 12 of these were sampled in the treatment and ambient groups after each ramp. The second temperature ramp (Ramp 2a) of the 2013 temperature experiment was repeated with Isla Natividad juvenile abalone in 2014 (Ramp 2b). In this temperature ramp experiment, as in the previous trial, ten animals were exposed to a 5 °C ramp from 22.89 °C to 27.5 °C while 10 animals were maintained at 23.2 ± 0.2 °C. The high temperature exposure also reflected the ‘warm blob’ conditions of 2014 (27–28 °C). After 30-hr exposure, all abalone were evaluated for hemocyte viability as an indicator of sub-lethal stress.
