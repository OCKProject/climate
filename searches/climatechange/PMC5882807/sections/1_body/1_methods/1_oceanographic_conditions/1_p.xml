<p id="Par6" class="p">In order to understand the nearshore oceanographic variability in our study region under the context of regional climate variability, we used the multivariate EÑSO Index (MEI)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> to examine any climatic anomalies the abalone may have experienced during the experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). We also obtained wind data from the NOAA/NCDC Blended Daily 0.25-degree sea surface wind data set that is available on the NOAA-ERDDAP data portal for the period from 2002–2016. We used satellite-derived winds to estimate local upwelling between years in terms of cumulative wind stress
