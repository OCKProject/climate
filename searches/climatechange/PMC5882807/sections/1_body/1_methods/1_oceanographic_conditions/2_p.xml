<p id="Par7" class="p">To characterize differences in ocean conditions at each site (MP and PP) and depth (7 m or 12 m) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), dissolved oxygen and temperature were measured continuously during experiments, in 2013 and 2014, using either a Seabird SBE37-ODO (Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., Washington, USA), an Aanderaa Optode (Xylem Inc., New York, USA) or a PME MiniDOT (Precision Measurement Engineering, Inc., California, USA) sensor. Each sensor was cross-calibrated with other sensors prior to and after deployment, and sampled at 10 minute intervals through the duration of the experiment. Data were downloaded at the end of 9 weeks for both years and variation in these variables were compared between sites, depths and through time to characterize the environmental conditions to which each group of animals were exposed (e.g. the occurrence, intensity and duration of hypoxic events, see Fig.
