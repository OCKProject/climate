  <p class="p">Shell growth and percent mortality of juvenile abalone in 2013 and 2014. 
   <bold class="bold">(a)</bold> Mean change in shell length at the end of ~8 weeks in millimeters (mm). Black and grey bars indicate 2013 and 2014 outplants respectively. PP 7 data are not available (NA) because of high mortality at this location in 2013, and MP 12 and MP 7 data are not available (NA) because of loss of cages during an extreme storm in 2014. (
   <bold class="bold">b,c)</bold> Mean percent of dead abalone by week. Note, there is a different y-axis scale for panel (c). 
   <bold class="bold">(b)</bold> 2013 mean percent mortality of Isla Natividad juvenile abalone by week. 
   <bold class="bold">(c)</bold> 2014 mean percent mortality of Isla Natividad juvenile abalone by week. For panel (c), NA = mortality data not available due to weather conditions preventing divers from site visits. For all panels, MP = Morro Prieto; PP = Punta Prieta; 12 = depth of outplants in meters; 7 = depth of outplants in meters; error bars represent ± standard error.
