  <p class="p">Behavioral and physiological performance of juvenile abalone. 
   <bold class="bold">(a)</bold> Proportion of the total juvenile abalone inactive after elevated temperature and ambient treatments at each sampling point (SP). 
   <bold class="bold">(b)</bold> Mean proportion of non-viable hemocytes after 24-h (approximately 19–25 degree C ramp, Ramp 1 followed by SP 1) and 48-h (approximately 23–27 degree C ramp, Ramp 2a followed by SP2). Mean proportion of non-viable hemocytes after 24-h in a repeated temperature ramp (Ramp 2b followed by SP 3) from 23 to 27 degrees C. Grey bars indicate cell response to temperature ramp treatment and black bars indicate cell viability response to ambient temperature conditions. For all hemolymph samples, n &gt; 200 total number of cells were counted on a hemocytometer. Error bars are ± standard error; SP = sampling point.
