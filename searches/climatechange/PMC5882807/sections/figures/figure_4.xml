  <p class="p">Juvenile abalone performance under oceanographic variability. 
   <bold class="bold">(a)</bold> Absolute change in shell length as a function of the temperature index (degree days above 20 °C). The monochromatic gradient represents the oxygen index (days below 4.6 mg/l dissolved oxygen) to which the abalone were exposed at the same time as the temperature. 
   <bold class="bold">(b)</bold> Proportional mortality of juvenile abalone as a function of the temperature index (degree days above 20 °C). The monochromatic gradient represents the oxygen index (days below 4.6 mg/l dissolved oxygen) to which the abalone were exposed at the same time as the temperature. See supplemental material for detailed temperature and oxygen index estimation. Note: The OI scales for the growth versus mortality data is scaled for the total exposure experienced at the time of sampling point—i.e., over 8 weeks versus weekly for the two datasets respectively.
