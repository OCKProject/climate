<p class="p">Like many watersheds, the Snohomish is projected to experience substantial hydrologic change over the next 100 years due to changing climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Summer precipitation is projected to decrease and winter precipitation to increase. This may convert some perennial streams to seasonal streams and in winter months may result in an increase in stream power. Beavers may be able to mitigate some of these hydrologic changes by reducing stream power, allowing reaches to aggrade [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and converting higher gradient streams into stepped pools that disperse energy. These pools also impound surface water, allowing it to recharge groundwater [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and supplement streams during low-flow periods [
