<p class="p">Beaver reintroduction and relocation hold much potential for habitat restoration and for addressing the impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Identifying where to perform those introductions over large areas, however, remains a conservation challenge. Here, we demonstrate how models of remotely sensed intrinsic habitat potential identify potential habitat with high confidence. This approach offers a straightforward method for developing accurate estimates of the potential for beaver habitat using readily available data. The accuracy of this model makes it particularly useful for identifying sites that are suitable for beaver relocation and beaver-assisted restoration.
