<p class="p">Based on the range of conditions present at potentially suitable sites, we assigned a ranked value from 0–4 to each of these variables, commensurate with their level of intrinsic potential according to the criteria in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192538.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Ranking values for each variable were based on a combination of expert opinion and analysis of habitat preference at locations identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192538.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. Higher weight (value 4) was given to metrics with high intrinsic habitat potential (e.g., slope ≤ 1%). We assigned a final BIP score for each segment by summing the ranked scores of stream slope, stream width, and valley width (analogous to the IP model of Burnett et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]). We assigned intrinsic potential scores to all stream segments within the Snohomish River Basin to produce the BIP model. The model possesses four predictive categories of beaver intrinsic potential: No BIP, Low, Moderate, and High BIP, numbered 0–3, respectively.
