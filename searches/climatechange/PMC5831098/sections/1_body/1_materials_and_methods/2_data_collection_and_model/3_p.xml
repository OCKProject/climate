<p class="p">Stream bankfull width and associated environmental variables such as upstream contributing basin size and stream power have been identified as primary characteristics of potentially suitable habitat. Suzuki and McComb [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] reported that beavers preferred streams 3–4 m wide for damming with an outside range of 2–10 m in Oregon’s Coast Range, USA. Barnes and Mallik [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] found that the upstream watershed area was most useful for differentiating active and previously colonized sites from sites with no dams, in Ontario, Canada. Pollock et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] analyzed the effect of stream power, a measure of stream force incorporating discharge and channel slope, and found that beaver dams were limited to sites with a stream power of less than 2,000 J*s
