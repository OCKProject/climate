<p class="p">We compiled and derived remotely sensed spatial, hydrogeomorphic, and other physical data for the Snohomish River Basin. We processed all spatial data layers and compiled them in a geographic information system (GIS) using ArcGIS. We obtained hydrography data layers consisting of a combination of field-verified and digital elevation model (DEM)-derived stream segments from King and Snohomish Counties, Washington. We derived stream slope, bankfull width, discharge, and stream segment breaks using the methodology outlined by Davies et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The valley width for each stream segment was then calculated using the methodology described in Beechie and Imaki [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Valley width was defined as the average width of the area adjacent to a stream segment that was within 2 m vertical elevation of the channel elevation. We obtained soil type and permeability layers within the study watershed from U.S. Forest Service soil inventories [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Soil types (e.g., sandy-loam) were converted to percent silt, clay, and sand so that these data could be treated as continuous variables instead of factors for multivariate analysis during validation.
