<p class="p">The BIP model assigned one of four BIP values (
 <italic class="italic">High</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Moderate</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Low</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">No BIP</italic>) to 48,397 stream segments comprising 5,019 stream km within the Snohomish River Basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192538.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192538.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Most reaches with high BIP were concentrated in lower gradient areas outside of the Cascade Mountains. Approximately 23% of all streams were categorized as high BIP, 10% as moderate, and 8% as low BIP. The remainder of the streams (~60%) in the basin were classified as having no intrinsic potential for beaver colonization. Most of these were high gradient headwaters. The majority of high BIP reaches were located in low gradient streams (i.e., â‰¤ 3%) with wide floodplains or on side channels of large rivers. Smaller pockets of high BIP reaches were also identified in more mountainous areas.
