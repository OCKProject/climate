<p class="p">Understanding and predicting where suitable beaver habitat exists within their geographic range can help inform recovery efforts, restoration planning, and conflict avoidance in populated areas. Beavers are generalist species [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and can be found in most biomes of North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Regional habitat suitability index (HSI) models have been developed throughout North America to map suitable beaver habitat characteristics. These models predict 
 <italic class="italic">currently</italic> suitable beaver habitat, but have less utility for predicting where beaver 
 <italic class="italic">could</italic> be if they modify the landscape, or appropriate restoration actions or land-use management actions were taken. Because vegetation often does not meet criteria that a traditional HSI model would identify as suitable, many potentially suitable areas are not considered for restoration planning or relocation actions. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, vegetation data are not currently mapped at fine enough spatial resolutions to allow for landscape-scale HSI models to be applied over larger spatial extents.
