<p class="p">North American beaver (

 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], beavers and beaver-created wetland complexes were a ubiquitous component of riparian systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Many species depend upon these systems due to the high geomorphic complexity, aquatic thermal variability, and habitat diversity that they aford. For example, the decline in populations of some aquatic species, including Pacific Coho salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus kisutch</italic>), have been partially attributed to the loss of beaver ponds [
 <xref rid="pone.0192538.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], a feature that salmonids have evolved with since at least the Pleistocene [
