<p id="par0120" class="p">Genomic selection (GS) has been used extensively in animal breeding programs and in the last 10 years has become popular for improving the rate of genetic gain in crop breeding. GS employs genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of lines in a segregating population, which are calculated based on the genotypic and phenotypic dataset of a ‘
