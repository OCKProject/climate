<p id="par0130" class="p">A large number of genes for targeted traits in many crop species have been cloned, and underlying quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) with significant effects have been identified. Genes with defined QTNs that cause a sizeable phenotypic effect can be modified by GE. It is also possible to combine GE and GS and the strategy has been referred to as the promotion of alleles by genome editing (PAGE) [
 <xref rid="bib0560" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In the near future, alleles that have a positive effect in the targeted phenotype can be transferred through genomics-based approaches (MABC and FB) and alleles that have an adverse effect in the targeted phenotype can be corrected through PAGE/genome editing.
