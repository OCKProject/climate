<p id="par0115" class="p">A number of molecular breeding approaches have been used to introgress genomic regions into elite lines [
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Marker-assisted selection is useful to introgress a few loci (&lt;10 loci) for improving elite varieties. It has been widely used in a number of crops to incorporate desired traits into elite cultivars through marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). Nowadays there is an emphasis on early generation selection by using the forward breeding (FB) approach [
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In this approach, a set of diagnostic markers for must-have traits is used to screen early generations and a subset of lines is advanced to the next generation. This approach is useful for enhancing the selection intensity to accelerate the genetic gains. Marker-assisted recurrent selection may be appropriate for more complex traits controlled by up to 40 loci. This approach can be used to develop superior lines with an optimum combination of superior alleles through repeated inter-crossing [
