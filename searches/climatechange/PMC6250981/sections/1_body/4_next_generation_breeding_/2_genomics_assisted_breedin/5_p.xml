<p id="par0135" class="p">Once superior breeding lines are developed, evaluation of these lines in the target population of environments (TPEs) is the crucial component for selecting the lines that will perform better in changing climate conditions. In fact, breeding programs now need to place greater emphasis on increasing the TPEs for evaluation than on development of more lines and phenotyping them at a limited number of locations.</p>
