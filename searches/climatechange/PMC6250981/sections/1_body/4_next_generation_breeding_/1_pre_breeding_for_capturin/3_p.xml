<p id="par0110" class="p">Access and benefit-sharing agreements (ABS) arising from the use of genetic resources (including CWR) should be shared in a fair and equitable manner between different stakeholders for successfully running the pre-breeding program. Additionally, access to pre-breeding materials, open access data, and

Though there are several success stories for accessing superior alleles through pre-breeding, it is important to have long-term and adequate funding for pre-breeding to have accelerate access of superior alleles related to climate change related traits.
