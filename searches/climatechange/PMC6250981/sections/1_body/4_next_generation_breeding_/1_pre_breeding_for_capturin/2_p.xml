<p id="par0105" class="p">It is important to note that working with CWR in pre-breeding program is a challenging task especially due to the crossing barrier and introduction of linkage drag from CWR in the elite genepool. Recently, Demepewolf and colleagues [
 <xref rid="bib0520" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] provided strategies to deal such challenges after undertaking extensive literature search and in-depth interviews with the experts. For instance, embryo rescue approach can be useful to handle interspecific crossability. Genomics technologies are very helpful for identification of the markers linked with useful segments in CWR that can be used for introgression and minimizing linkage drag. Furthermore, genome editing technologies, once established in a given species, can also be used to repair deleterious effect CWR allele(s) and convert un-adapted material into superior lines [
