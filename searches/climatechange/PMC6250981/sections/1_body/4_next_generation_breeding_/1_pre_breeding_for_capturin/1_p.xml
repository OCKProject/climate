 <xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The breeders can use these intermediate materials further in producing new varieties. It is a first essential step in the ‘linking genetic variability to utilization’ use of diversity arising from CWR and other un-adapted materials. A collaboration between the germplasm curator and the plant breeder is essential for bringing new traits from these collections into newly bred varieties. The decision for pre-breeding is based on the anticipated effectiveness and efficacy of transferring the target traits into cultivars and source of the desired gene(s). Pre-breeding can be useful in: first, broadening the genetic base, second, identifying and characterizing climate change relevant traits in exotic materials, third, identification and introgression of genes from wild species or unadapted material into breeding populations, and fourth, identification and transfer of novel genes from unrelated species using genetic transformation techniques.
