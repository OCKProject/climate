<p id="par0070" class="p">In this review, we discuss strategies for identification of superior alleles/haplotypes from the genebanks, development and use of genotyping and phenotyping platforms and deployment of GAB approaches for pre-breeding and development of climate-change ready crops. We also present the challenges and opportunities toward integration of multidisciplinary research platforms/disciplines for developing climate change ready crop varieties (
