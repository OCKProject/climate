 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] provides a framework to guide, quantify and monitor interventions. Integration of modern genomics approaches for example next generation sequencing (NGS), high-throughput genotyping together with high throughput phenotyping (phenomics) and informatics and decision support tools can accelerate genetic gains over time [

  <sup class="sup">••</sup>
 </xref>]. Selection intensity (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) can be increased if we can screen more plants per unit time or area. Advances in phenotyping (such as disease plots, artificial screening in labs/greenhouse, etc.) can accelerate the screening of a large number of plants for the trait of interest. Molecular markers can be used as proxies for phenotypic characteristics allowing selection to be performed on young plants and/or in early generations. Availability of high-throughput sequencing/genotyping platforms can allow assaying of thousands of plants in relatively short time. Selection accuracy (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) can be increased by using trait-linked markers that allow off-season selection in any location. For instance, in a year with adequate precipitation, selection of drought-tolerant plants is not possible in traditional breeding approaches. However, robust genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) approaches can be utilized in any season or any stage of plant growth [

 </xref>]. Genetic variance (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </sub>) can be increased by selecting those lines that have favorable but rare alleles for a trait(s) of interest. Years per cycle (
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>) can be reduced by growing more generations per year through rapid generation (3–6 crop seasons per year) advancement and/or speed breeding [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11
  <sup class="sup">••</sup>
 </xref>], instead of 1 or 2 crop seasons per year. Speed breeding can be combined with selection on a single plant basis using visual selection or molecular markers.
