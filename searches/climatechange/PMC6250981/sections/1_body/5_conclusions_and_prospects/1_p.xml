<p id="par0140" class="p">While working on germplasm collections including CWR, the genetics community can map climate change relevant traits with the help of high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping platforms in a faster and more cost-effective manner. Next generation breeding approaches including GS and GE can use the new germplasm and technological advances to develop climate change ready lines. Public crop improvement programs have pioneered the development of new technologies and breeding methods. To capture these opportunities [

 </xref>] more co-ordination is needed so that these advances can be translated into delivering higher genetic gains in farmers’ fields, particularly in the developing world. Therefore, to mitigate the current challenges we have to deploy a unified strategy to make a more significant impact through integrating different disciplines and to increase selection intensity, selection accuracy, heritability and next generation breeding approaches to develop climate change ready crops in a cost-effective and rapid manner. To make the unified strategy workable, crop improvement programs (with multi-disciplinary scientists and not just breeders) need to set the priorities and take the advice from their stakeholders to develop a product profile. Team members need to work and complete their part in the value chain. The new lines with higher yield and adaptation to extreme conditions should be evaluated in the TPEs so that climate resilient crop varieties are developed quickly. Appropriate agronomical practices together with GIS can be useful for improving adoption of superior lines, for realizing enhanced yield in farmers’ fields and for providing more income to farmers. It is also essential to connect with the farming community, state governments and non-government organizations to support equitable ownership of resources and benefit sharing [
