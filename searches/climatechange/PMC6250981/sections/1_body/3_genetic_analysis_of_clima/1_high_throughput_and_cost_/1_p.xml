<p id="par0085" class="p">Genotyping of all individual samples or selected recombinants of the targeted population either for trait mapping or product development is a critical step for identifying better alleles and/or superior lines for development of climate-resilient crops. The reliability, turn-around-time, ease of information retrieval, as well as the cost of a genotyping assay are critical to a breeder for making decisions about selection of individuals to advance to the next generation. Several genotyping platforms that leverage new technologies to discover and simultaneously genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are currently available [

 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Some of the most widely used sequencing-based genotyping approaches are genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, double digest restriction associated DNA, skim-based genotyping by sequencing, repeat amplification sequencing, exome sequencing and whole genome re-sequencing (WGRS). Fixed SNP genotyping arrays may be preferred over NGS based technologies due to higher throughput at a lower cost per sample with minimum data analysis required. Rasheed and colleagues [
