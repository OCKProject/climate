<p id="par0090" class="p">Phenotyping, at present, is a significant operational bottleneck that limits the power and resolution of many genetic analyses. Robust, precise and high-throughput phenotyping systems are required for measuring a full suite of genetic factors that contribute to quantitative phenotypic variation across cells, organs, and tissues, developmental stages, years, environments, species and research programs [
 <xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. A fundamental advance in high-throughput phenotyping platforms is the capability to non-destructively capture plant traits [
 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Recent advances in sensors for imaging plants, ranging from remote sensing including spectroradiometry, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), visible to far-infrared, hyperspectral, thermal, fluorescence, and 3D laser scanning to trichromatic imaging in conjunction with advanced autonomous vehicles, have indeed opened up the possibility of high-throughput phenotyping [

 <xref rid="bib0465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Autonomous platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and ground robots equipped with multiple sensors can take pictures in near real-time of the entire experimental plot several times per day, or over the entire season from germination to maturity, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and storage [
 <xref rid="bib0470" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Use of such phenotyping platforms for measuring traits on germplasm collections, adapted to harsh conditions, in simulated climate change conditions will help to identify the genes and lines that cope with future climatic conditions.
