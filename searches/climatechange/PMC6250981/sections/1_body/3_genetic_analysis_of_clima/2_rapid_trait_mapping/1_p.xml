<p id="par0095" class="p">Advances in genomics have led to the development of NGS based trait mapping approaches, which have speed up trait mapping programs from a few years to just a few months. For instance, NGS technologies have enabled modification and improvement of time-consuming bulked segregant analysis [
 <xref rid="bib0475" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] into rapid and whole-genome sequencing based high-resolution trait mapping [
 <xref rid="bib0480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39â€¢</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The availability of draft genome sequences for a number of crop species and reduction in sequencing costs have also made it possible to resequence hundreds to thousands of individuals of a genetic population. As a result, the genetics community was able to deploy WGRS or low coverage sequencing of the entire population or bulks of the extremes. GBS and WGRS of entire mapping populations or extreme pools provide large-scale genome-wide SNPs for conducting high-resolution trait mapping, and several examples have been reported in many crop species [
 <xref rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. On the other hand, bulk or pool-based sequencing has become popular for rapid trait mapping in recent years [
 <xref rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>].
