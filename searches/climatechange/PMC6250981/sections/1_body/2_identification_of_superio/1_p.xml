<p id="par0075" class="p">Approximately 7.4 million accessions are stored in 1700 seed banks globally, offering breeders a wealth of natural variation. Genebank passport data coupled with climatic data could be used as surrogates for abiotic stresses to identify genotypes that harbor important haplotypes which can then be integrated into breeding programs. To enhance the genetic gains through the incorporation of new sources of genetic variation, novel and superior genes need to be identified from crop wild relatives (CWR) and landraces available in genebanks [

 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. There are many examples where NGS based approaches are being successfully used to identify DNA polymorphisms associated with traits of interest. For instance, The 3000 Rice Genome [

  <sup class="sup">••</sup>
 </xref>] and The 3000 Chickpea Genome Sequencing Initiative [
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] offer opportunities to identify novel variations for a large number of genes through genotype-phenotypic associations. Re-sequencing of a large number of germplasm accessions not only provides information on the origin, domestication, and population structure [

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17••</xref>], but also identifies lines with deleterious mutations in the genomes that can eliminated to minimize the genetic load in the crop species [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. NGS technologies together with precise phenotyping have been used for identification of marker trait associations in several crops, for example, rice [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19
  <sup class="sup">••</sup>
 </xref>], soybean [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], pigeonpea [
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16
  <sup class="sup">•</sup>
 </xref>], foxtail millet [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and pearl millet [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17
  <sup class="sup">••</sup>
 </xref>]. Insights gained from these studies include new information on the genetic architecture of agriculturally important traits and the identification of valuable and sometimes novel alleles/haplotypes for morphological, agronomic, developmental and quality-related traits for enhancing genetic gains. In the context of developing climate change ready crops, it is essential to mine and incorporate superior alleles adapted to harsh and extreme environmental conditions by resequencing and phenotyping many germplasm accessions for the crop species.
