<p id="par0080" class="p">Specialized mapping populations can be used to enhance the power and efficiency of genome wide association studies (GWAS). Nested association mapping (NAM) populations were first developed for maize as a way of taking advantage of both historical and recent recombination events [
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. This was important to minimize the density of markers required for GWAS and take the advantage of the high allelic richness, high mapping resolution, and high statistical power of association mapping. Multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24â€¢</xref>] are another type of specialized mapping population, which are used to shuffle the genetic background by allowing several rounds of recombination in the genomes of diverse parental lines [
 <xref rid="bib0410" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Both types of populations have been successfully developed and used to identify QTLs for a number of traits in diverse crop species for example, maize [
 <xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], wheat [
 <xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], rice [
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and cowpea [
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Where robust donors are available for targeted traits, bi-parental mapping populations, that is, doubled haploid, recombinant inbred lines, introgression lines, and F
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> populations are still useful in the identification of significant genomic region(s) for the trait of interest.
