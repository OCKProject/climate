<p class="p">Knowledge of the effects of bark beetle outbreaks on host tree population genetic structure and resistance to attack will be increasingly valuable as climate change drives more frequent outbreaks and facilitates the movement of beetle species into na√Øve forests. Outbreaks of MPB seldom kill all mature trees despite high beetle numbers during population peaks. Our results suggest that surviving trees possess a wealth of information that can be used to inform our understanding of the genetic and phenotypic bases for resistance and to develop management approaches that support forest adaptation.</p>
