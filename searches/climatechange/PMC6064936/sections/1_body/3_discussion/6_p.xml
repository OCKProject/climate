<p class="p">This study corroborated the findings of other studies that found that MPB colonizes smaller diameter whitebark pine than lodgepole pine during outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dooley et al., 2015</xref>). The mortality of younger whitebark pine trees indicates a more severe impact of MPB outbreaks on whitebark pine forests, at least in the short term, because advanced regeneration is killed along with large trees. However, the loss of large and mid-diameter trees may serve to open areas for nutcracker caching of seeds from the remaining resistant trees, potentially increasing the frequency of those genotypes and phenotypes at the site and within the larger population.
