<p class="p">We found that surviving mature trees in a high elevation forest of whitebark and lodgepole pine were genetically distinct from “general population” trees that were assumed to represent the genetic structure of the population pre-outbreak and without selection by the beetle. In line with our hypothesis, a low percentage (&lt;10%) of “survivor” genotypes were identified within the general population. The proportion of these survivors roughly mirrored the proportion of mature trees that survived the outbreak at Vipond Park. The neighbor-joining tree, the PCoA and the STRUCTURE analyses each indicated strong differentiation between survivors and “susceptible” individuals and identified the same trees as survivors within the general population. In the STRUCTURE analysis for both whitebark and lodgepole pine, susceptible trees belonged to one cluster while survivor trees belonged to two other clusters. This separation can also be seen in the PCoA. Further research will be needed to determine whether the patterns we detected are indeed indicative of resistance, and if so, whether there are multiple or overlapping factors that account for survivorship.</p>
