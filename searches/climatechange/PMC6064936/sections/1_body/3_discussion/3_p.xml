<p class="p">We found surprisingly high levels of differentiation between survivor and general population trees in both species of pine. For whitebark pine, Nei’s genetic distance between survivor and general population whitebark pines was 5%, a value that would indicate moderate differentiation if these comparisons had been made between tree populations. Likewise, AMOVA indicated 13% of the genetic variation present existed between groups. Considering that the trees in this analysis were not from different populations, but rather grew intermixed at the same site, these values seem strikingly high. Likewise, for lodgepole pine, Nei’s genetic distance was 7%, and AMOVA indicated 11% of variation occurred between the groups.</p>
