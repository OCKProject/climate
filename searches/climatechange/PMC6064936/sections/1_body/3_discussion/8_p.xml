<p class="p">A caution is in order in interpreting our results. We were unable to amplify DNA from MPB-killed trees which forced us to use smaller diameter “general population” trees as a substitution for “susceptible” trees. These trees were mature reproductive trees and only slightly smaller than trees selected by the beetle for colonization; however, some or all may constitute a cohort that regenerated under different environmental conditions resulting in a genetic structure unrepresentative of the larger trees that were available for selection by the beetle. However, the proportional distribution of survivor and “susceptible” trees in the neighbor-joining trees, PCoAs and STRUCTURE analyses indicate that the general population samples were likely appropriate proxies.</p>
