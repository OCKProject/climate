<p class="p">We chose ISSR profiling as a first step to determine whether survivors were different than trees chosen by MPB for colonization. This PCR-based method detects high levels of polymorphism, is highly reproducible, and allows the screening of a large number of trees relatively rapidly and economically. Unfortunately, this method cannot tell us why survivors are different, only that they are. Further study will be needed to further investigate whether survivors are indeed highly resistant and, if so, to determine the actual basis behind resistance. Ongoing studies are investigating correlations among genetic profiles of survivor and “susceptible” trees with phenotypic traits including defensive chemistry and growth rates in relation to climate. Genomic approaches will also be extremely useful to elucidate the basis of resistance.</p>
