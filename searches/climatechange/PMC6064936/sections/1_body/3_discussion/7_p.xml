<p class="p">In a previous study, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Six and Adams (2007)</xref> found that as infection severity increased so did the likelihood of attack by the beetle. However, while we found that white pine blister rust infection severity was significantly higher in general population trees than survivors, the mean level of infection severity at the site was very low and the size effect between means for survivors and general population trees was very small. Therefore, we feel it is unlikely blister rust played a significant role influencing beetle dynamics at the study site.
