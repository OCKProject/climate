<p class="p">Supporting forest adaptation is critical in this time of rapid change (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Millar et al., 2007</xref>). Given the great expanses of forest that are being affected by climate change and the fact that most will need to adapt 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>, it is imperative we begin to move past structural approaches to consider the genetic capacity of forest trees to adapt. The high degree of standing genetic variation found in most forest trees indicates many will have considerable ability to adapt. We need to be cognizant of adaptation that is occurring so that our management approaches act to support rather than hinder natural selection for traits needed under future conditions.
