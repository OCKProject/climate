<p class="p">With climate change supporting the invasion of aggressive bark beetles into naïve forests, and predictions of more frequent and severe outbreaks, it is increasingly important to understand the capacity of trees to adapt and persist (

While the massive mortality of pines in western North America in recent years is cause for concern, we should also look at these hard-hit forests as opportunities to learn. In almost all cases, affected forests are not completely dead–they retain many living large diameter trees. If these trees are genetically different than those selected and killed by the beetles as our study suggests, these trees may aid in

 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> adaptation. In contrast, the effects of natural selection in these stands could be instantly negated by clearcutting or replanting with general seed stock.
