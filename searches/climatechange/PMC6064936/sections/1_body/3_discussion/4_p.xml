<p class="p">These results indicate the presence of genetically based resistance in both pine species and that trees with resistant genotypes are not selected for attack. It has been thought that once MPB achieve high population levels during outbreaks, the selection of individual trees based on tree-produced compounds and condition becomes swamped by high levels of aggregation pheromone production and competition for increasingly rare hosts (
