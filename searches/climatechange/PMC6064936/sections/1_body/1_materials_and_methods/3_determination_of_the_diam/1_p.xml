<p class="p">In initial transects, the diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.4 m above the soil line) of 100 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and 45 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> killed by MPB were measured to estimate the diameter distribution of MPB-killed trees for each species. This distribution was used to inform our sampling of “survivors” (mature trees that survived the outbreak) so that a similar distribution was achieved, and to determine the diameter below which trees were not attacked.
