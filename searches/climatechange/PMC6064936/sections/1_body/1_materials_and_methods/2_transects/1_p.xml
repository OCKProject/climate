<p class="p">Transects were established in 2015 (
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic>) and 2016 (
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic>). These were variable length belt transects 2 m in width that started on the edge of a stand and then followed a randomly chosen bearing until another edge was reached at which point a new bearing was adopted to establish a new transect in the same or an adjacent stand. This process was continued until the desired number of trees per species per treatment were measured. When trees occurred in clumps (resulting from seed caching by Clarkâ€™s Nutcrackers), we restricted measurements and samples to one tree per clump to avoiding sampling trees potentially originating from the same cone/parent.
