<p class="p">This study was conducted at Vipond Park, a high-elevation plateau supporting a patchwork of grassland and open forest stands located on the Beaverhead National Forest, Montana, United States (2,501 m elevation, 45.6974
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>N, 112.9106
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>W). The site is relatively xeric with an understory of sagebrush and a diverse mixture of annual and perennial forbs. Vipond Park was chosen to take advantage of the high mortality to pines that occurred there during a recent high elevation outbreak of MPB (2009â€“2013) when approximately 93 and 75% of mature 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic>, respectively, were killed. The relatively flat topography of the plateau combined with its location at the transition zone between lodgepole and whitebark pine-dominated forests allowed us to study the effects of MPB selection on more than one pine species growing under the same conditions and experiencing the same level of beetle pressure. Although 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> existed at lower numbers than 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> at the site, they were abundant enough to allow sufficient sampling to make comparisons with whitebark pine. Additionally, white pine blister rust infection incidence and severity were very low reducing the potential for the presence of the disease to influence the choice of individual host trees by the beetle (
