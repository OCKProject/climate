<p class="p">For each tree species, we examined genetic variation between groups using analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) in GenAlEx 6.5 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peakall and Smouse, 2006</xref>). We then conducted a principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) in GenAlEx based on genetic distances between individual trees in the two groups for each species of tree. Genetic distance matrices were developed for each tree species in the 
 <italic class="italic">Restml</italic> program and then imported into 
 <italic class="italic">Neighbor</italic> in PHYLIP 3.67 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Felsenstein, 2005</xref>) to produce an unweighted neighbor-joining tree. The tree was visualized using TreeView 1.6.6 (
