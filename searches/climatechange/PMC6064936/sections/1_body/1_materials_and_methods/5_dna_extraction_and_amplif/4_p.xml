<p class="p">PCR products were visualized in a 1% agarose gel prepared using 1× tris borate buffer (TBE) to which 2 μl ethidium bromide per 100 ml gel was added. A 100 bp ladder (Promega, Valencia, CA, United States) was placed in the first lane of each gel to provide a reference for scoring bands. Amplified DNA was loaded into the remaining lanes with bromophenol blue as a running dye. Each gel was run with 1× TBE as a running buffer at 70 mA until the dye moved 3/4 of the length of the gel. Gel images were captured using a UV table. Any sample that gave ambiguous results (no, faint, or smeared bands) was repeated. Approximately 20% of samples were rerun and compared to check for consistency in results. Only samples exhibiting clear bands were included in the final analysis. Bands were scored manually.</p>
