<p class="p">For amplification we used a 25 μl reaction mixture consisting of 12.5 μl Promega Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, United States), 2.5 μl RNA-free water, 8 μl of 0.5 M primer and 2 μl of DNA template. Reactions were run individually with one of the five ISSR primers. PCR was conducted with one cycle denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 42 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1.3 min, annealing at 47°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. A final cycle was conducted at 72°C for 1 min and final products were held at 6°C (
