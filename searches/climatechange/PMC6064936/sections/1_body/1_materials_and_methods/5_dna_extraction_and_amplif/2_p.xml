<p class="p">Five ISSR primers were chosen for use (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Not all primers worked equally well for both species of trees. Therefore, we chose three primers for use with 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and four for 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic>. Two primers overlapped in use for both trees (
