<p class="p">The smallest diameters of 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> killed by MPB were 12 and 18 cm, respectively. Because beetle-killed trees did not yield DNA, we used this information to choose a second set of living trees for sampling of each species we designated as the “general population.” These trees were expected to approximate the genetic structure of the population of each tree species at the site without beetle selection and so should contain a mix of survivor and “susceptible” genotypes. If our hypothesis was correct that survivors were genetically distinct from beetle-susceptible trees, then we expected only a few general population trees would have genotypes matching those of survivors (roughly reflecting the proportion of mature survivors to mature MPB-killed trees at the site). To sample general population trees, we established similar transects as before, but collected needles from trees between 9–11 and 14–17 cm DBH for 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 36) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20), respectively.
