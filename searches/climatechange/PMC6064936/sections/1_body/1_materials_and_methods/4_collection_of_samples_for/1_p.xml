<p class="p">In 2015, transects were established as previously described. Thirty survivor 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> with diameters representative of the diameter distribution of MPB-killed 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> were located on the transects. For each tree, DBH was measured and each was rated for white pine blister rust infection severity using the method of 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Six and Newcomb (2005)</xref>. Then, approximately 30 current-year needles were collected and placed in a small plastic bag that was sealed and placed on ice in a cooler. In the lab, needles were placed into silica gel for drying and preservation. In 2016, this procedure was repeated for 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20) (except for rust rating) in the same stands sampled the previous year.
