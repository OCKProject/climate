<p class="p">The mean, median, and range of diameters of beetle-killed and survivor 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> were similar (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). The mean diameter was not significantly different between survivor and beetle-killed trees, while the diameter of general population trees, as expected, differed significantly from both groups (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). The same was true for 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Similarly, mean diameters of MPB-killed and survivor 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic> did not differ from one another. However, the minimum size of tree attacked by the beetle differed by tree species resulting in the choice of different diameter distributions for sampling general population trees (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Blister rust infection severity was overall very low at the site, but significantly lower in survivors (mean = 1.3, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 1.8) than in general population trees (mean = 1.7, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 2.4; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 1.63, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 65, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.013; potential range 0â€“18).
