<p class="p">H
 <sub class="sub">T</sub>, the total genetic diversity between the two study groups, was 0.26, and the diversity within groups, H
 <sub class="sub">S</sub>, was 0.24. Seven of 28 loci (25%) exhibited significant differences between observed and expected frequencies of bands between the two groups (data not shown). However, no bands were unique to either group. The Ewensâ€“Watterson test for neutrality detected only one marginally non-neutral locus. AMOVA indicated 87% of the variation exhibited existed within groups and 13% existed between groups.
