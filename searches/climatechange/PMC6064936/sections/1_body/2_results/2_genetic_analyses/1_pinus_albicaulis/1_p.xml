<p class="p">Three primers (17899A, HB12, and UBC807) resolved well for 
 <italic class="italic">P. albicaulis</italic> and were used for ISSR analysis. A total of 28 loci (bands) were resolved using the three primers (

  <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). Mean percent band polymorphism (BP) for all primers for all trees (general population and survivors) combined was 96.4% and this value was similar to the BP for each group individually. The Shannon information index and Nei’s gene diversity was lower in general population trees compared with survivors (
