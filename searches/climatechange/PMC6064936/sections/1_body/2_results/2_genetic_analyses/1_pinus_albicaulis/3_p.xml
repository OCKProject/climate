<p class="p">The neighbor-joining tree resolved most general population trees together in the basal clades while one major terminal clade contained all survivor trees as well as eleven general population trees that were distributed throughout the clade (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). In the PCoA, the first two principle coordinates explained a total of 33% of the variation associated with the two groups. Adding the third, 43.55% was explained. In general, the eleven general population trees that clustered with survivors in the neighbor-joining tree resolved separate from other general population trees and with survivors in the PCoA (
