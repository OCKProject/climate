<p class="p">The neighbor-joining tree partitioned general population and survivor trees into several clades (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </bold>). Most (55%) general population trees resolved in one clade. The remainder resolved into two clades interspersed with survivors (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </bold>). The general population trees that resolved with survivors in the neighbor-joining tree shared clusters with survivor trees in the STRUCTURE analysis (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>) and also partitioned with survivor trees in the PCoA (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). The first two principle coordinates in the PCoA explained 21.5% of the variation between the two groups. Adding the third component explained 31%.
