<p class="p">Four primers resolved well for this species (17899A, UBC807, UBC901, and UBC811). Using these primers, we were able to resolve a total of 85 bands. The mean percent BP across all primers and groups was 98.82. This was considerably higher than BP for the general population (89.4%) and survivor (88.2%) trees (
