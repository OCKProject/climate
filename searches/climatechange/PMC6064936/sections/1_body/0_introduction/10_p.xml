<p class="p">Our objective in this study was to investigate whether whitebark and lodgepole pine growing in a mixed high elevation stand that survived the outbreak are genetically distinct. If so, this may indicate an increased potential for these pines to persist in the face of the more frequent and extensive outbreaks predicted due to a changing climate. We would expect genetic change at loci underlying beetle resistance but not at a genome-wide scale. Without knowing the basis for resistance in survivors, we chose to use inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) to develop genetic profiles for whitebark and lodgepole pine. ISSRs target highly variable sequences within microsatellite regions (

Because ISSR markers can be used to detect high levels of polymorphism and are highly reproducible, they provide a powerful approach for comparing genetic diversity between individuals as well as within and among populations of plants including pines (

In many studies, ISSR profiles have been useful in marker assisted selection when particular markers were associated with particular traits (REFS). In our screens, we looked for patterns that indicted differences between survivors and susceptible trees.
