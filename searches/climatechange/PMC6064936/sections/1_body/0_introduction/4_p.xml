<p class="p">Adaptation in trees may be accelerated when new conditions or agents lead to high levels of mortality and directional selection in favor of heritable traits associated higher fitness and survival. For example, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuparinen et al. (2010)</xref> used computer simulations to investigate rates of adaptation to longer thermal growing seasons and found that mortality of established trees was the key factor regulating the speed of adaptation with dispersal ability and maturation age having substantially lesser effects. Disturbances caused by agents that use selective behaviors in choosing individual trees, such as herbivorous insects that respond positively to tree stress, can elicit rapid microevolution even in slow-growing tree species (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petit and Hampe, 2006</xref>). Such agents may benefit forests in the long-term by increasing mortality of poorly adapted trees, enhancing the reproductive potential of surviving better-adapted trees, and reducing genetic lag loads in affected populations (
