<p class="p">Except for highly fragmented or relictual populations, forest trees possess moderate to high levels of standing genetic variation and often exhibit considerable local adaptation and within and among population diversity (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alberto et al., 2013</xref>). Adaptation of forests to climate change will depend upon the outcome of interactions between existing genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and selection pressure over a relatively short period of time. However, adaptation in trees can be slow due to long generation times and low mortality of older, well-established, but increasingly maladapted trees that continue to contribute to the gene pool (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuparinen et al., 2010</xref>). Long generation times can result in considerable genetic load with long lags between mean optimal genotype and existing climate (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuparinen et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, while phenotypic plasticity may allow some genotypes to maintain high fitness over a broad range of environmental conditions and aid in resilience to climate change in the short-term, it may slow down or hinder adaptation and persistence in the longer-term (
