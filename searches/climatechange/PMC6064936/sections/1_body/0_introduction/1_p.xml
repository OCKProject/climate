<p class="p">The capacity of forests to adapt to rapid climate change is not known. Their ability to adapt will vary greatly depending upon tree species, amount and type of genetic variation existing within and among populations, type and degree of change required, strength and type of selection pressure, heritability of desirable traits, and the timeframe over which selection is able to act. Many long-lived sessile organisms, including trees, are unlikely to be able to track shifting conditions through migration (
