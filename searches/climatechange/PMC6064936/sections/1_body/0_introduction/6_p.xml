<p class="p">In this study, we investigated whether trees that survive MPB outbreaks are genetically different than those that are selected for colonization and killed. Our overarching hypothesis was that surviving trees do not escape by chance, but rather possess genetically based characteristics that confer resistance. The basis for resistance, whether it is the ability to tolerate warmer drier conditions without a reduction in defenses, a chemical profile that negatively affects MPB host location or selection, or some other phenotypic trait, is likely to be under genetic control (
