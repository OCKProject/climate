<p class="p">We focused on two tree species that have suffered high mortality by MPB in the recent outbreak. One is a relatively naïve host, whitebark pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus albicaulis</italic>), and the other is a highly co-evolved host, lodgepole pine (
 <italic class="italic">P. contorta</italic>). Whitebark pine is a high elevation tree that is considered a keystone in western subalpine ecosystems of the United States and Canada (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tomback et al., 2016</xref>). Historically, outbreaks in whitebark pine appear to have been rare and limited in size (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Logan et al., 2010</xref>). During warm periods, beetles sometimes moved upslope from lower elevation outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bartos and Gibson, 1990</xref>) where they killed some whitebark pine, but either did not reproduce successfully due to winter mortality, or completed only one or a few generations before the return of cold conditions once again limited them to lower elevations (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Logan et al., 2010</xref>). The recent outbreak in whitebark pine has been extensive and has been driven by chronic warm temperatures that allowed the beetle to move into the subalpine and to persist there for an extended period (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). With climate change, the presence of MPB in high elevation whitebark pine forests is expected to be persistent rather than occasional (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Whitebark pine exhibits many of the characteristics of a naïve host, including lower levels of defense chemicals and resin (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Reduced snow packs may also result in greater drought stress that may increase susceptibility (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Larson and Kipfmueller, 2012</xref>). Outbreaks in this tree have been devastating in some areas, including the Greater Yellowstone Area, contributing to the recommendation that it be listed as an endangered species (
