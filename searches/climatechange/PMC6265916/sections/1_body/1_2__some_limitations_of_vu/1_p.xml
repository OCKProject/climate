<p class="p">Climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation (V&amp;A) assessments are designed to provide insights into current and projected future risks of climate variability and change, as well as options for preparing for and effectively managing these risks [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Numerous health vulnerability and adaptation assessments have been completed (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]), with many more underway. Since climate change and health is a relatively new issue for ministries and departments of health, and due to limited human and financial resources for conducting V&amp;A assessments and short planning cycles, these assessments tend to focus on reducing vulnerability to current climate variability for a limited number of climate-sensitive health outcomes. In response to these assessments, policies and measures are being implemented to enhance local to national level preparedness within, for example, vector-borne disease control programs.
