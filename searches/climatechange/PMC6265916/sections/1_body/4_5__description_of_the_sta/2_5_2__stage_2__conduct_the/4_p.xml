<p class="p">Examples of additional actions for health systems to manage shocks and stresses associated with climate change are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-ijerph-15-02370" class="xref">Appendix D</xref>. There are several factors that participants should consider when recommending which actions to undertake, including:
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Necessity—which actions are most critical;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Timing—when a particular facility, program or other health system function may be vulnerable to certain climate impacts and when particular actions should be taken in to prepare for and respond to the timing of the hazard and other preparation and response activities;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Capacity—whether current surge capacity levels and available expertise are sufficient to handle projected impacts, or whether these need to be increased;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Likely losses—expected increases in morbidity and mortality; facilities where adaptation is prohibitively expensive and should not be undertaken; areas where programs or polices will need to be reevaluated due to unavoidable impacts (e.g., health transportation and supply lines that rely on ice roads); and contingent additional losses if mutual aid is not available); and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Costs—the economic, political, environmental, and social costs of taking actions to increase resilience, whether they are manageable and how they compare to the costs of inaction.</p>
