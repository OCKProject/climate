<p class="p">The focus of health adaptation to climate change has been on strengthening health systems to better manage its impacts. The WHO 
 <italic class="italic">Operational Framework for Building Climate Resilient Health Systems</italic> describes the possible implications of climate change for the six building blocks of health systems: leadership and governance, health workforce, health information systems, essential medical products and technologies, service delivery, and climate and health financing [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], and by the Pan American Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] to increase the sustainability and resiliency of healthcare facilities in the Americas [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. While incremental improvements to modify current programs are important first steps to increase resilience, they may lead to inadequate preparation of health systems and overconfidence in their ability to manage multiple concurrent and synergistic climate-related exposures outside the range of historic experiences, as expected with climate change.
