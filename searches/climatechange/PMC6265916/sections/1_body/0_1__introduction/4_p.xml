<p class="p">These challenges are compounded for health systems struggling to manage the current health risks of climate variability and change due to limited adaptive capacity [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], such as those in many low- and middle-income countries. The Solomon Islands provides an example to illustrate the potentially severe climate-related impacts and challenges for health systems. In that country, many health facilities, including the only tertiary hospital in the country, are located on the seashore, with limited seawall protection and at high risk of storm surges, flooding, and sea level rise [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A dengue outbreak in 2013, and flash flooding in 2014, illustrated the extreme weakness and vulnerability of the health system and health facilities due to structural damage and increased patient demand. Following the flooding event, 31 acute and subacute deaths were recorded, as well as a diarrhea outbreak that affected 8584 people. This resulted in a surge of inpatients that strained healthcare staff and depleted medical supplies. Damage to the hospital and surrounding clinics, serving 26,000 people, led to the evacuation of patients [
