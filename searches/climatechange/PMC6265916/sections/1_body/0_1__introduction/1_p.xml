<p class="p">Climate and other global environmental changes are fundamentally altering our future. Possible futures include a “hothouse earth” if self-reinforcing feedbacks result in continued warming, despite reductions in greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Even stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures is projected to result in a significantly warmer future within the next few decades [

Climate variability and change, including increasing temperatures, alterations in the hydrologic cycle, and increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and climate events, are associated with a range of adverse health consequences. Impacts can be direct, such as illnesses and deaths from heatwaves and severe storms; or can arise from indirect pathways, such as poor health outcomes associated with human migration, ecosystem changes (e.g., vector-borne diseases), food insecurity, and economic decline [

Some impacts of climate change, such as effects on mental health (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, violence, suicide) may occur in the short-term or extend over several years, with associated implications for their management by health systems [
