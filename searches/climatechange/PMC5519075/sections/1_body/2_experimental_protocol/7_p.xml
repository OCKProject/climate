<p class="p">To examine the randomization process, we use multinomial logit regression to predict one’s assignment to each treatment group as a function of income, gender, education level, political ideology, and partisan affiliation. We could not reject the null hypothesis that each variable’s effect was jointly zero, which suggests that randomization worked. (The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value of a χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> test of the null hypothesis was 0.30 (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 46.19, df = 42).) As such, we are confident that any differences in our outcome variables across treatments are a function of the treatments themselves, rather than differences in the characteristics of participants.
