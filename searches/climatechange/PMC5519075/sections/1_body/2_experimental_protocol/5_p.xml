<p class="p">Following from Bolsen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], who find that framing scientific issues in a political light can reduce their effectiveness, we also randomly varied whether or not the source of the frame was presented to participants. As some may see our sources—the U.S. Department of Defense, the United Nations, and the National Academy of Sciences—as political entities, the efficacy of the frames may be reduced when sources are made available. Alternatively, as per Druckman [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], the official nature of these sources may enhance the credibility of the frames, which could potentially make them more effective. As such, we do not have clear expectations about whether the inclusion of sources will make frames more or less effective.
