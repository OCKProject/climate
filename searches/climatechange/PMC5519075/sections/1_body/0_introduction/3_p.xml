<p class="p">A number of studies use randomized experiments to isolate the effects of issue framing on public opinion about climate change. Yarnal et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] find that attitudes toward the way in which climate change should be addressed vary according to whether it is framed as a local or national issue. Schuldt et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] find that using the term “global warming” rather than “climate change” can affect the probability that individuals perceive the phenomenon as real. Petrovic et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] find that alluding to man-made climate change decreases the likelihood that conservatives agree that air pollution is harmful. Aklin and Urpelainen [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] find that framing climate change as a matter of national or economic security can affect support for clean energy policy. Bernauer and McGrath [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] find that highlighting the potential economic, community building, and health benefits of climate change mitigation does not influence public support for mitigation policies. Myers et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] find framing climate change as a public health issue most effectively elicits hopeful emotions about proposed mitigation policies. Severson and Coleman [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] find that religious moral frames and economic efficiency frames are ineffective in increasing overall support for climate change policies, while secular moral frames, scientific frames, and economic equity frames do boost support. Wiest et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] find that framing climate change as a local or global issue and emphasizing associated losses and benefits can, to a varying degree, affect perceptions of the climate change severity, support for policy action, and behavioral intentions. In sum, the findings of extant studies, while mixed, together imply that certain frames are more likely than others to generate support for climate change.
