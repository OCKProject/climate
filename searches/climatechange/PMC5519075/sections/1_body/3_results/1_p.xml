<p class="p">Because, as described above, assignment to the control and treatment groups appears to be truly random, we examine the effects of the treatments using a difference-in-means estimator. Here, we convey the results of these tests graphically, and we provide corresponding numerical information in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181401.s003" class="xref">S2 Table</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181401.s004" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>. In all subsequent figures, a confidence interval that overlaps 0 indicates that a particular treatment effect is not significant at the 0.10 level, two-sided.
