 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181401.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> illustrates how the effects of issue frames on relative rankings of climate change policy importance vary across ideological and partisan groups.

The upper-left panel of the figure suggests similar patterns among those on the political left. The remaining panels of the figure demonstrate that, with regard to opinions about the relative importance of climate change policy, we find no evidence that issue frames affect independents, centrists, Republicans, and rightists.
