<p class="p">Rather than being unaffected by frames, those on the right and Republicans tend to rate climate change policy as 
 <italic class="italic">less</italic> important than their counterparts in the control group when the issue is framed. This is especially true when sources are provided. For example, as shown in the bottom-right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181401.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, as compared to those in the control group, Republicans who are exposed to sourced issue frames, on average, rate the importance of climate change policy about 1.5–2.0 points lower on the 0–10 scale. Sourced frames produce a “boomerang” or “backfire” effect among Republicans. The negative effect is strongest in the environmental frame, in which the source is the National Academy of Sciences. There is also some evidence of “backfire” among centrists and independents, though, even when statistically significant, effect sizes are relatively small.
