<p class="p">Finally, our findings may differ from previous studies because we analyze different outcome variables. While we focus on the absolute and relative importance that individuals assign to climate change policy, Yarnal et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] consider support for various government programs aimed at addressing climate change and the likelihood that one will take voluntary action to combat it, Schuldt et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] examine whether individuals believe the climate is actually changing, Aklin and Urpelainen [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] examine support for clean energy policy alone, Petrovic et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] examine whether individuals agree that air pollution is harmful, Kahan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] examine whether individuals found published studies about climate change valid and their beliefs about extent to which climate change is occurring, and Myers et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] examine emotional reactions. Severson and Colemanâ€™s [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] outcome variable, support for climate change mitigation policies, is closest to ours. Wiest et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181401.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] also employ support for policy action as one of their three outcome variables.
