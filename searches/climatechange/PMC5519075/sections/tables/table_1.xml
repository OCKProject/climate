Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty, and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe. A changing climate will have real impacts on our military and the way it executes its missions. Our armed forces must prepare for a future with a wide spectrum of possible threats, weighing risks and probabilities to ensure that we will continue to keep our country secure. By taking a proactive, flexible approach to assessment, analysis, and adaptation, the Defense Department will keep pace with a changing climate, minimize its impacts on our missions, and continue to protect our national security.</td>

     <td align="justify" colspan="5" rowspan="1" class="td">Climate change is a growing concern for the UN refugee agency. In 2013, 22 million people were displaced by disasters brought on by natural hazard events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects an increase in the number of displaced [people] over the course of this century. Climate change will force people into increasing poverty and displacement, rendering both the humanitarian needs and responses in such situations more complex. Scarce natural resources such as drinking water are likely to become even more limited. Many crops and some livestock are unlikely to survive in certain locations if conditions become too hot and dry, or too cold and wet. The adverse effects that climate change may have on natural resources, may spark conflict with other communities, as an increasing number of people compete for a decreasing amount of resources.</td>

     <td align="justify" colspan="5" rowspan="1" class="td">Science has made enormous progress toward understanding climate change. As a result, there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that Earth is warming. Global warming is closely associated with other climate changes and impacts, including rising sea levels, increases in intense rainfall events, decreases in snow cover and sea ice, more frequent and intense heat waves, increases in wildfires, longer growing seasons, and ocean acidification. Individually and collectively, these changes pose risks for a wide range of human and environmental systems. Projections of future climate change anticipate an additional warming of 2.0 to 11.5°F (1.1 to 6.4°C) over the 21st century, on top of the 1.4°F already observed over the past 100 years. Furthermore, different sectors, populations, and regions will vary in their exposure and sensitivity to the impacts of these changes.</td>
