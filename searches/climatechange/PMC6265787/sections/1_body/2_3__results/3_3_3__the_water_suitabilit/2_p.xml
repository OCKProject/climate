 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, the water suitability of apple plantations in the four study areas is projected to be relatively stable in the period of 2019 to 2050, and the mean values are all projected to be concentrated in the range of 0.4 to 0.7. It should be noted that the maximum values of water suitability in the four sub-regions all appear in 2036, which indicates that the spatial distribution of water suitability in the future is even in the Loess Plateau. We also found that although the projected changing trend of water suitability is generally showing a decreasing trend under the climate change scenarios, the slope of the changing trend is reduced compared with the past period (1990â€“2013). Therefore, we speculate that the water available for apple tree growth will be more sufficient in the future. Because climate change imposes great impacts on precipitation and evapotranspiration and thus influences the water demand and the water suitability of apple trees, it is necessary to pay attention to the impact of climate change on water suitability of apple plantations in the future.
