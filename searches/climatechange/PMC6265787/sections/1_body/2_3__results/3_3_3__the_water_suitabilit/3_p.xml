 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02504-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows the future multi-year average and root mean square error of water demand, effective precipitation, and water suitability in each sub-region. Compared with the past period (1990–2013), the water suitability in the future (2019–2050) is projected to be generally higher (except the western part), indicating that with the climate change the contradiction between water supply and demand will be alleviated.
