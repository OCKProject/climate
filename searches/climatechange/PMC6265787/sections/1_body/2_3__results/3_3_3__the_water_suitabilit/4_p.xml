 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows the projected spatial evolution of water suitability of apple trees in each study area from 2019 to 2050. The projected water suitability of apple trees in the four sub-areas increases as the longitude increases, but it decreases as the latitude increases. Generally, the northern and western parts are projected to be poor for water suitability compared with the eastern and southern parts. In 2020, the average value of water suitability in the study area is projected to be only 0.56, but in 2040 and 2050, it is estimated to be 0.63 and 0.66. Consequently, the sustainability of apple plantations is estimated to be better in the future under climate change compared with the past period due to precipitation increases and potential evapotranspiration decreases.
