 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the variation is large according to the mean value of the water suitability. The highest water suitability in the eastern part of the study area was in 2003, with about 50% of the values above 0.5, and the lowest value appeared in 1997, with 50% of the values below 0.5. The highest water suitability in the western part of the study area appeared in 2003, with the mean value around 0.8, and the minimum appeared in 1997. The maximum value of water suitability in the southern part of the study area appeared in 1996, and 50% of the values concentrated at 0.65 or larger. The minimum value appeared in 1997, with the mean value of suitability less than 0.4. The mean values of water suitability in northern part of the study area were the lowest of all the study areas. Overall, the slopes of the changing water suitability trends are all negative except for the southern part of the Loess Plateau, which indicates that the water suitability was showing an obvious downward trend in the past period of 1990â€“2013. The maximum water suitability was always concentrated in September and October, which represent the later growth stages of the apple trees. The minimum water suitability was usually concentrated in the early growth stages for apple trees in March and April. Our results are consistent with the previous research of Yang Xiaoli [
