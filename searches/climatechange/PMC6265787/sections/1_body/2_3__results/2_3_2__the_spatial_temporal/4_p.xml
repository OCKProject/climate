 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the spatial distribution of water suitability of apple trees from 1990 to 2013. The results show that the order of the water suitability is Sanmenxia Region (southern region) &gt; Shaanxi Province (northern part) &gt; Gansu Province (western part) &gt; Yuncheng (eastern part). The low-value areas are located in Yuncheng, Tongchuan of Shaanxi Province, and Tianshui of Gansu Province. This may be due to the larger water demand of apple trees and the relatively lower rainfall in these areas. In general, Shaanxi Province is the main apple production area in China, whose apple production accounts for more than 30% of the national total. In this study, we found that the water suitability of apple trees in Shaanxi Province (north and middle area of the Loess Plateau) is relatively higher compared with other areas.
