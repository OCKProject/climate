 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02504-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the multi-year average and root mean square error of water demand, effective precipitation, and water suitability for each study area. From the perspective of the whole growth period, the effective precipitation is much smaller than the water demand, and the annual average of effective precipitation and water demand varies greatly. It can be seen from the table that the water suitability in the western part of the study area is the best, and the water suitability in the eastern part is the worst, indicating that the water scarcity in the eastern part of the study area is much more severe. The spatial evolution of apple tree water suitability is further analyzed as shown in
