<p class="p">The Loess Plateau is located in a semi-arid region with insufficient surface water resources. Many fruit trees are planted in mountainous areas without irrigation conditions, and the water resources are quite limited. Therefore, the water required for plant growth during the whole growth period depends on atmospheric precipitation. To simplify the description of the temporal evolution of apple tree water suitability, the study area was divided into the eastern part of the study area (Yuncheng and Sanmenxia Regions), the western part of the study area (Dingxi, Pingliang, and Tianshui Regions), the southern part of the study area (Baoji, Xianyang, Tongchuan, and Weinan Regions), and the northern part of the study area (Qingyang and Yan’an Regions). Based on the results, it was found that the water suitability of apple trees in each growth period is not exactly the same as the whole growth period. Generally, the water suitability in the initial growth period is the lowest, and the highest values are concentrated in the later stage of growth, which is mainly because the precipitation in the Loess Plateau is mainly concentrated in the summer and autumn months. We also found that the main contradiction between water supply and water demand for apple plantations in the Loess Plateau is the spring drought, which represents a potential threat for vegetation restoration. Moreover, we further analyzed the temporal change trend of water suitability of each study area in the past period (1990–2013).</p>
