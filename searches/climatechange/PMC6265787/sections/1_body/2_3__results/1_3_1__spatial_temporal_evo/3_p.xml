 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the spatial distribution of the average water demand of apple trees in the four sub-areas from 1990 to 2013. It was found that the water demand of the apple trees was relatively evenly distributed in the north-south direction, and the values from the east and the west were relatively larger than the middle. The high value areas of apple tree water demand were concentrated in Yuncheng Region and Tianshui and Dingxi Regions of Gansu Province. The average annual water demand was higher than 500 mm and the highest was around 1000 mm. A slight decreasing trend in the water demand of apple trees can be observed, especially for the middle and east areas, which may have resulted from the climate changes in recent years leading to a significant decline in the potential evapotranspiration of apple trees. Therefore, it is important to study the potential evapotranspiration of apple trees under future climate change conditions and then forecast the gap between water supply and demand of apple plantations.
