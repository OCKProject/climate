<p class="p">The Grain for Green Project in the Loess Plateau is not only a regional project, but also a national project in China, and it is not only a public ecological protection project, but also a huge economical investment project. Therefore, it is related to the sustainable development of all Chinese people. In recent years, the Grain for Green Project has achieved remarkable results mainly because it relies on national policy subsidies with huge economic inputs. Thus, the continuous economic inputs represent the decisive factor to the development of vegetation in the region. Based on this, in order to maintain the sustainable development of vegetation on the Loess Plateau and to improve the function of the Grain for Green Project, a national compensation system that uses government transfer payments to ask the developed area to compensate the developing areas in the Loess Plateau is urgently needed. In addition, a performance appraisal system for basic-level government should be established as soon as possible. Under this system, the regional government(s) that performs well can be rewarded and the regional government(s) that perform poorly can be warned and/or punished.</p>
