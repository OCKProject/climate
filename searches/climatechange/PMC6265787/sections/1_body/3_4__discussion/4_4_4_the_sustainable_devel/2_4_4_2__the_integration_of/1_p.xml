<p class="p">Soil water and rain water are the main forms of water resources in the Loess Plateau. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development of the vegetation ecosystem and agricultural production system, it is very necessary to tap the soil water potential and increase the rainwater harvesting and utilization rate. It is also necessary to promote agronomic measures, to strengthen modern farming management on dry lands, and to develop rainwater collecting technologies, high-efficiency and precision irrigation technologies, soil moisture prediction technologies, and modern wisdom agricultural management technologies. More importantly, a new technical model should be established to promote comprehensive water-saving technologies and management strategies.</p>
