<p class="p">The Loess Plateau is poor in water resources. The rivers and reservoirs within the Loess Plateau are always at low elevation, while apple trees are planted on hillsides, therefore, irrigation is very difficult, and precipitation is almost the only source of growth for apple plantations in the region. Due to the deep aerated zone in the Loess Plateau, the soil water resources represent a key form of support for vegetation restoration and ecological development, which is also the key linkage between surface water, groundwater, and crop water. According to a previous study, the soil water in the Loess Plateau accounts for more than 80% of the potential rainwater resources in the arid and semi-arid areas of China [

As a consequence, we propose the “water-vegetation harmony” management concept, which means that the planting structure of apple plantations in the Loess Plateau should be strictly determined by the soil water resources carrying capacity.
