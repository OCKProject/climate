<p class="p">The concept of “water-vegetation harmony” management is derived from the concept of optimum water agriculture, which means pursuing the balance between the demand and supply of agricultural water resources through various measures in order to improve the matching degree of crop water demand and local available water resources. This study provides an important method for the “water-vegetation harmony” management based on the index of water suitability, which can be widely applied in other similar research studies in the future.</p>
