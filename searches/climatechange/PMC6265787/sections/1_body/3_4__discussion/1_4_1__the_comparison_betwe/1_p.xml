<p class="p">In order to evaluate the reliability of the results of this study, we compared the results of this study with previous studies. By analyzing the water suitability of apple orchards in the past, we found that the water suitability of apple trees at different growth stages is not completely consistent within the whole growth period. A previous related research study arrived at similar conclusions to our own. Yang et al. found that apple trees had poor water suitability in the initial growth period, that the water requirement after apple ripening was lower than the initial growth period, and that the water suitability reached the highest value in the apple ripening stage [

Our study also calculated the future water suitability of apple trees through analyzing the water balance based on the estimation of future climate elements, in which the global climate data released by the IPCC Fifth Research Report and the corresponding regional downscaling methods were used. Previous related research studies had a similar approach to our own. Liu et al. used 19 GCMs under RCP4.5 scenario derived from CMIP5 and it was also found that the results were reliable [

 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Gao et al. analyzed the future climate data released by CMIP5 based on regional downscaling model (RegCM4.0) and found that the precipitation is expected to increase significantly (5% confidence level) in the Loess Plateau under both the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In the above studies, the methods used are close to those used in our study and the findings are also consistent with our results.
