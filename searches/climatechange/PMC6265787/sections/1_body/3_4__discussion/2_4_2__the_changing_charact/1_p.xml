<p class="p">Water suitability is proposed as the ratio of precipitation and water demand in each growth stage of apple trees through the estimation of water demand in each stage of growth using Penman-Monteith formula based on the observed meteorological data during the growth period of apple trees. Therefore, the potential influencing factors mainly include precipitation, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and so on. Firstly, we used the historical observed data and the climatic forecasted data to analyze the changing characteristics of water demand for apple trees in the study area, as shown in
