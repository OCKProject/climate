 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>, during the period of 1990–2050, the apple tree water demand values in the four sub-areas are all greater than the effective precipitation, therefore the water requirement for apple tree growth cannot be fully satisfied in the Loess Plateau. However, notable differences can be observed among different sub-regions in the Loess Plateau in regard to the changing characteristics of water requirements and effective precipitation. In Sanmenxia Region and Gansu Province, the water requirement and effective precipitation are both showing an obvious growing trend in the period of 1990–2050, but the growth rate of the water requirement is significantly larger than the growth rate of effective precipitation. Comparatively, in Yuncheng Region and Shaanxi Province, the growth rate of the water requirement is lower than the growth rate of effective precipitation. The above findings indicate that the water balance in the core part of the suitable area for apple tree growth in the Loess Plateau is much better than other areas.
