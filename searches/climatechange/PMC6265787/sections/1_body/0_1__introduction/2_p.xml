<p class="p">However, due to drought and water shortage in the Loess Plateau, the rapid development of the apple industry has changed the previous water balance. The water consumption of orchard farming under dry conditions is often greater than the water income, which causes a severe water deficit [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that vegetation construction in the Loess Plateau is close to the limit of water resources [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In fact, the artificial plantations in this area have exceeded the deep soil water carrying capacity, resulting in deep soil desiccation [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In the apple tree planting areas of the Loess Plateau, the terrain is complex and the irrigation conditions are poor, therefore, the apple orchards are always under dry farming conditions. Water is an important factor for the survival of various plants; in the Loess Plateau, rainwater has become the only water resource for the development of forestry and fruit tree planting. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to carry out a macroscopic evaluation of the water suitability of apple plantations in the Loess Plateau in order to ensure the sustainable development of local apple plantations and the stable increase of farmersâ€™ incomes.
