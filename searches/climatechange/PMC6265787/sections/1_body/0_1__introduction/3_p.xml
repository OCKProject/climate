<p class="p">Water suitability is the most important part of the research on the environmental suitability of plants in dry farming areas. The core of the calculation is to estimate the amount of the water demand. In recent years, some methods of measuring evapotranspiration have been proposed, but the application in large-scale areas is limited by the large uncertainties caused by the high requirement for measuring conditions [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-02504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Due to the complicated plant growth process, the estimation of water demand is difficult. Since the 1990s, many scholars have analyzed the water suitability in different growth stages of winter wheat, corn, and other economic crops based on potential evapotranspiration and precipitation [

Especially in the context of climate change, the economic suitability of apple plantations in terms of precipitation requirements and plant water demand must be further studied in the context of future climatic conditions in the Loess Plateau in order to provide an important reference for the future economic forest planning and development in the region.
