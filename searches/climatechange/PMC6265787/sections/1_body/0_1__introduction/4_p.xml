<p class="p">Based on this, the main purpose of this paper is to predict and estimate the water demand of apple plantations, and then to investigate the water suitability of the apple plantations in the Loess Plateau. The study first calculated the water demand of the apple orchards by estimating the potential evapotranspiration with crop coefficients (Kc). Then the observation data and the climate prediction data from coupled model inter-comparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of precipitation in the study area. Finally, a crop water suitability index was introduced to quantify the water suitability of apple orchards in the past and future, which could guide the planning, development, and management of apple plantation from a scientific basis. Contents of this research are as follows: (i) the Penman-Monteith formula with Kc was applied to calculate the temporal and spatial distribution of the water demand during the apple growth periods in the study area; (ii) the historical and future precipitation data in each region were used to estimate the effective precipitation of apple orchards, and then the apple water suitability estimation model was established; (iii) according to the evaluated water suitability of apple plantations in the study area, sustainable development strategies were proposed focusing on both the ecological restoration of the area and the improvement of regional farmersâ€™ incomes. </p>
