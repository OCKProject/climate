<p class="p">Soil erosion and water shortage are the two major bottlenecks influencing the ecological construction and sustainable economic and social development of the Loess Plateau. Since the 1990s, the Chinese government has implemented the Grain for Green Project, and the ecological construction of the Loess Plateau has resulted in significant improvements. In order to restore the ecology and increase the income of the local farmers at the same time, the Chinese government has vigorously expanded the economic forest planting areas for crops such as red date and apple in the Loess Plateau and achieved remarkable benefits. With the implementation of national policies, apple production has become an important industry for the Loess Plateau to cope with the large-scale reduction of cultivated land and to promote regional economic development effectively. It is also important to ensure the sustainable development of the Grain for Green Project. Up to 2013, under the promotion of “Northward and Westward Expansion”, the apple plantation area of Shaanxi Province in the Loess Plateau reached 950,000 hm

The apple planting has become a leading industry solving the large-scale reduction of cultivated land effectively after the implementation of the Grain for Green Project and promotes regional economic development. Maintaining the efficient and sustainable development of the apple industry is considered a key component for the promotion of the local domestic economic income, the regional economic sustainable development, and the ecological environment.
