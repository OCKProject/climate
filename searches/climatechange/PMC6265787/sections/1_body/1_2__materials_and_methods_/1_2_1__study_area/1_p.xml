<p class="p">China is an ideal place for apple production. The four major apple producing areas include the Bohai Bay area, the Loess Plateau area, the Yellow River old channel area, and the southwest highland area. Among the four major apple producing areas, the northwest Loess Plateau area is very large and contains good quality land. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02504-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the study area of this paper is the Loess Plateau area, including Weinan, Yan’an, Tongchuan, Xianyang, and Baoji of Shaanxi Province, Yuncheng of Shanxi Province, Sanmenxia of Henan Province, and Pingliang, Tianshui, Dingxi, and Qingyang of Gansu Province. In 2000, the total size of the apple plantations in the Loess Plateau was 847,600 hm

Under the promotion of the “Northward and Westward Expansion” layout, the apple planting area in the Loess Plateau is expected to increase continuously, accounting for one-third of the national yield, and one-eighth of the global yield. The annual average temperature of the study area is 3.6–14.3 °C, and the annual precipitation is 150–750 mm, with precipitation mainly concentrated in July to September. The annual potential evaporation is 1400–2000 mm and the annual sunshine duration is 2000 to 3100 h. Abundant sunshine radiation and long sunshine hours provide sufficient energy for photosynthesis of green plants. The long sunshine duration and high temperature difference between day and night makes the middle and southern parts of the Loess Plateau ideal locations for apple tree cultivation [
