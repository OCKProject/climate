<p class="p">Water demands of apple trees are different in different growth stages. According to the growth characteristics of apple trees in the northern Shaanxi section of the Loess Plateau, the growth period is divided into the first growth period (germination to the post-bloom), the vigorous growth period (post-bloom to 10 days after maturity), and the post-growth stage after fruit harvest (ten days after maturity to the end of the defoliation) (shown in

In the 1990s, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) organized many famous scholars to conduct water demand tests on various plants (including economic crops, and fruit trees) around the world, and obtained the relationship between crop water demand and potential evapotranspiration in order to determine the Kc of various crops at different growth stages. In this study, we determined the parameters of Kc in the study areas according to research results of the FAO, which are shown in
