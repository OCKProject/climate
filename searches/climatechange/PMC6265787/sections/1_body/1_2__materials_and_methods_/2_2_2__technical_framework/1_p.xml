<p class="p">In this paper, we firstly analyzed and calculated the water demand in the apple tree growth period, and then established a water suitability model according to the effective precipitation in each sub-region. The calculated results of the model were able to quantify the water suitability of apple plantations in each sub-region. Based on the water suitability evaluation results, this paper proposed sustainable development strategies for apple plantations in the Loess Plateau in order to promote regional ecological restoration and the improvement of regional farmersâ€™ incomes. The research framework of this paper is as shown in
