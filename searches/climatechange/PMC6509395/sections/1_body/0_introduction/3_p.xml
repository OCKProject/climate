<p class="p">Northwestern China has experienced complex orogenesis and climate change. Following the tectonic uplift of the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau, the Paratethys Ocean was compelled to retreat from Central Asia, and the beginnings of an arid climate emerged (Guo et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Zhang, Dong, Yu, &amp; He, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Over a lengthy period of successive growth of the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau from mid‐Tertiary onwards, the climate of northwestern China was increasingly dry, because moist sea breezes from the Indian Ocean were obstructed, and the Pacific monsoon could not reach inland (Chen, Liu, Zhou, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). In addition, glacial–interglacial cycle had further impacts on the climate of the region during the Quaternary. Both climatic oscillations and historical orogenesis have caused complex landscapes and drier climates in northwestern China. Duo to aridification and orogenic, a large number of deserts and mountains of northwestern China have emerged as effective geographical barriers, resulting in fragmentation of species’ distributions and limited gene flow between fragmentations. Thus, in the populations of many desert plants have higher total genetic diversity but lower within populations genetic diversity, and allopatric divergence has generally been found in desert plants, for example,

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Due to dry glacial–humid interglacial cycle in the Quaternary in these regions, many species experienced glacial contraction and postglacial expansion with corresponding climate cycle. Several glacial refugia have been found in Ili Valley, Tianshan Mountains, and Helan Mountains (Meng &amp; Zhang,
