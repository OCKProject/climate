<p class="p">In the present study, we employed both nuclear and chloroplast markers and simple sequence repeat (SSRs) to investigate the spatial genetic pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic>. In angiosperm species, the chloroplast genome is maternally inherited from the ovary, while the nuclear genome is biparentally inherited from both pollen and ovary. The different patterns of inheritance of markers may reveal the complexity of gene flow because the distribution of genetic diversity estimated from different patterns of inheritance of markers may be tremendous difference (Petit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Thus, the two modes of inheritance allow us to examine the population structure from different perspectives. In this work, we aimed to address the following questions: (1) to reveal the evolutionary history and (2) explore current population genetic structure of
