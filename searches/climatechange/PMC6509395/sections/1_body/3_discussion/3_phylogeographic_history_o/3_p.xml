<p class="p">Coalescent theory predicts that ancient haplotypes will occupy interior nodes of a haplotype network and be geographically widespread, whereas the recent haplotypes will occupy at the tips of the haplotype network and be geographically local distribution (Schaal, Hayworth, Oseni, Rauscher, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). In this study, most haplotypes from Hami Basin + Hexi Corridor are the interior haplotypes, especially H6, H9, D7, and D9. The four are the most interior and widespread haplotypes, and can be considered as ancestral haplotypes. In contrast, haplotypes from other regions lie on the edge of the haplotype network. Within the entire network, many haplotypes of Tarim Basin and Alxa Desert + Wulate Prairie group are derived. This is also suggested by phylogenetic tree. Many earliest diverging haplotypes in

 <xref rid="ece35113-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), suggesting that these regions may be relatively ancient distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic>. Thus, we speculate on a hypothesis that 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> would have the opportunity to occupy new areas such as Tarim Basin and Alxa Desert + Wulate Prairie during the Pliocene to the early to mid‐Pleistocene. Subsequent glacial–interglacial cycles are likely to have resulted in gradual isolation and divergence of haplotypes in Tarim Basin and Alxa Desert + Wulate Prairie. However, due to the limited data, further research is needed.
