<p class="p">Previous evolutionary studies have shown the aridification since mid‐late Miocene significantly affected the diversification of 
 <italic class="italic">Gymnocarpos</italic> in the arid regions from North Africa to Central Asia, and intraspecific diversification of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> mostly occurred during the Pleistocene (Jia, Zhang, Raab‐Straube, &amp; Thulin, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our estimates of haplotype divergence of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii are</italic> consistent with previous studies, suggesting that the Quaternary climate fluctuations and aridification have important influence on the current geographical distribution of the species. Drastically increased aridity occurred in northwestern China during the Pleistocene, leading to expansion of deserts in these regions. For example, the Taklamakan Desert greatly enlarged after the early Pleistocene (Sun,

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The initial Gurbantunggut Desert was present at the mid‐Pleistocene (Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), the Badain Jaran‐Tengger Desert greatly enlarged during the mid‐Pleistocene (Yang, Fang, Dong, Peng, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and the sand desert landscape developed in the Ulan Buh Desert in late‐Pleistocene (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> is an arid‐adapted species, moderate moisture is essential for its growth and reproduction. The edge of oases provides many habitats with moderate moisture (Xu &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Because of this reason, when the desert expanded, the gene flow caused by pollen and seeds was limited, resulting in the increase in genetic variation.
