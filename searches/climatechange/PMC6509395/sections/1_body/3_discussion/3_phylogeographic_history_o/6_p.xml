<p class="p">The distribution areas of 
 <italic class="italic">G.przewalskii</italic> have a wealth of mountains that have complicated topology. The species in the Tarim Basin and the Hami Basin are mainly distributed along the southern Tianshan Mountains. The species in Hexi Corridor is mainly distributed along the northern Qilian Mountains. The species in Wulate Prairie is mainly distributed along the Yin Mountain. Populations of the species are distributed in scattered patchiness and mainly grow along foothills. Areas of complicated topography might provide suitable microenvironment in relative stability and survived there during severe climatic oscillations (Rull, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In addition, there were mountains that do not exceed 2000 meters in northwestern China without ice cover during the Pleistocene. The foothills that locate between the desert and the mountains were characterized by a relatively mild Pleistocene climate. Thus, we hypothesized that there are many patch‐like stable microenvironment in the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> so that the species can survive during climatic oscillations (Rull, Schubert, &amp; Aravena, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Thus, plant grown in microenvironment did not undergo large‐scale recolonization during interglacial, but rather a process of increasing the sizes of occupancy of its geographical distribution (Rull,
