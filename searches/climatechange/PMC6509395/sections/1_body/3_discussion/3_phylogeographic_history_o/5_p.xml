<p class="p">In present study, combining all data sets, we observed that almost all populations have high levels of genetic diversity, and 14 populations distributed in each group have unique haplotypes (Tables

 <xref rid="ece35113-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Thus, we observed neither hot spots nor cold spots, and could not find clines of genetic diversity from hypothetical refugial groups, or hypothetical recolonized groups. Furthermore, mismatch distribution analysis and the neutrality tests do not agree with a recent expansion (Figure
