<p class="p">Biological refugia are relatively stable areas where a species is predicted to have had persistent survival throughout climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. According to Petit et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), plant populations that have high levels of genetic diversity and unique haplotypes indicate that their associated areas may have served as glacial refugia. Previous studies of
