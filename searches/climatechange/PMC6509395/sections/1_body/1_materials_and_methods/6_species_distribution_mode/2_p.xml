 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). MAXENT employs environmental data in conjunction with presence‐only data to estimate the probability distribution. Species occurrence data were taken from our field surveys and the online database of the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (CVH;

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). To avoid this defect, we computed Pearson’ s correlation coefficient between each pair of variables, implemented in IBM SPSS Statistics 16.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The variables with correlation coefficient &gt;0.8 were considered as highly correlated. Finally, the models included seven variables: annual mean temperature (BIO 1), mean diurnal temperature range (BIO 2), temperature seasonality (BIO 4), mean temperature of the driest quarter (BIO 9), annual mean precipitation (BIO 12), precipitation of the driest month (BIO 14), and precipitation seasonality (BIO 15) (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35113-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). We projected the model using default settings for all parameters. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) calculated by MAXENT.
