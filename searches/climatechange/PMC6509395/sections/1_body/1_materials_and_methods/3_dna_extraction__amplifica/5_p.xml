<p class="p">Microsatellite loci were screened by the SSRHunter software (Li &amp; Wan, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). The redundant sequences were discarded manually. The primer pairs were designed for the microsatellite loci with suitable flanking sequences by NCBI primer blast. The primer pairs were initially screened against eight individuals to test for amplification and polymorphism. A M13‐tail (TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) was added to the forward primers of all the promising loci for fluorescent dye labeling (Schuelke, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Amplifications were performed in 25 μl reactions containing 60–100 ng genomic DNA, 2.0 10× PCR buffer, 1.6 μl dNTPs (2.5 mmol/L), 2.0 μl MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (25 mmol/L), 0.1 μL forward primer (10 μmol/L), 0.4 μl reverse primer (10 μmol/L) and fluorescently labeled (FAM) M13 primer (10 μmol/L), and 0.2 U Taq polymerase. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 45 s at 47–64°C, and 45 s at 72°C, an additional 8 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 45 s at 53°C, and 45 s at 72°C, and a final 12‐min extension step at 72°C (Schuelke, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The amplified fragments were analyzed with an ABI 3730XL (Shanghai Bioengineering, Shanghai, China). The resulting electropherograms were evaluated with GeneMapper 4.0 (Shanghai Bioengineering, Shanghai, China). In the enrichment library, 272 positive clones were sequenced. After discarding redundant sequences, 40 microsatellite sequences with suitable flanking regions were obtained for the designed primer pairs. Among the 40 tested markers, 17 loci were amplified successfully in

 <xref rid="ece35113-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Six polymorphic loci were used to determine genetic diversity of 17 populations from
