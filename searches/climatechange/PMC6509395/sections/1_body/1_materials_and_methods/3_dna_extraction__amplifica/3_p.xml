<p class="p">For the nuclear and chloroplast markers, we used total DNA to amplify and sequence two cpDNA fragments,

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), and one nuclear fragment, ITS (White, Bruns, Lee, &amp; Taylor, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). The PCR amplification program followed the protocol: 94˚C for 2 min, followed 94°C by 28 cycles 45 s, annealing at 52°C for 45 s, 72°C for 60 s, and an additional extension in 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified with Purification Kits (Qiagen) and sequenced in both directions by ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Shanghai Bioengineering, Shanghai, China). DNA sequences were edited and assembled in Seqman (Lasergene, DNASTAR Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA), aligned with Clustal X version 1.81 (Thompson, Gibson, Plewniak, Jeanmougin, &amp; Higgins, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>), and then checked by eye. Double peak sites were present in sequences of some ITS fragments, indicating heterozygous genotypes. To obtain haplotypes from unphased genotypes, we used the Bayesian method of PHASE 2.1 (Stephens &amp; Donnelly, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Stephens, Smith, &amp; Donnelly, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), implemented in DnaSP v5 software with default parameters (Librado &amp; Rozas, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and checked by eye using MEGA6.05 (Tamura, Stecher, Peterson, Filipski, &amp; Kumar, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In analysis of recombination, we used newly obtained ITS sequences. Recombination was tested within the ITS alignment of the 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> data set using the pairwise homoplasy index (Bruen, Philippe, &amp; Bryant, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), implemented in the software SPLITSTREE v.4.11 (Huson &amp; Bryant, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>).
