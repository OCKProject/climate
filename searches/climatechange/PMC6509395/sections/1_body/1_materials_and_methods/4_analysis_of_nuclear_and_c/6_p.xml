<p class="p">To investigate approximate divergence times of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii, </italic>we employed a Bayesian approach in the software BEAST version 1.8.1. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock was used for clock models, and a constant size process was used for modeling speciation. The MCMC search was run for 70,000,000 and 80,000,000 generations for ITS and cpDNA, respectively, and sampled every 1,000 generations. Four independent Markov chains were used in this process. TRACER 1.5 (Rambaut &amp; Drummond, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) was used to check the convergence of the MCMC chains. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was generated in TreeAnnotator using the product method with a burn‐in of the first 10% of sampled trees. Due to the lack of specific substitution rates in
