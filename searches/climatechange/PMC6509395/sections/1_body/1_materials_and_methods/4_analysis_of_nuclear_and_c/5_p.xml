<p class="p">Phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Outgroups for the cpDNA analysis were 
 <italic class="italic">Silene noctiflora</italic> (JF715056, complete genome) and 
 <italic class="italic">Silene atocioides </italic>(EU314655, EU308518); outgroups for ITS were 
 <italic class="italic">Silene noctiflora </italic>(FN821141),

 <italic class="italic">,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gymnocarpos decandrus </italic>(KF850591). Outgroup sequences were downloaded from NCBI (

 <italic class="italic">Silene noctiflora </italic>were obtained using methods similar to those with

 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The best substitution model was GTR + G for both cpDNA and ITS according to the Akaike information criterion, and was applied in BI, and BEAST analyses. The MP analyses were conducted in PAUP 4.0b10 (Swofford, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), with 1,000 additional sequence replicates and branch‐swapping using TBR. Parsimony bootstrapping (PB) was calculated from 1,000 replicates using fast and stepwise addition of taxa. BI analysis was carried out using MrBayes version 3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck, Ronquist, &amp; Hall, 
 <xref rid="ece35113-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), with 2,000,000 generations in two parallel runs, sampling trees at every 1,000th generation. The first 10% of sampled trees were treated as burn‐in and discarded.
