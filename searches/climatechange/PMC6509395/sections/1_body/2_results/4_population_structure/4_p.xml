<p class="p">The Mantel tests of both cpDNA and ITS showed a significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance matrices (cpDNA: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.260; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005 &lt; 0.01; ITS: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.505; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001 &lt; 0.01), suggesting strong isolation by distance. The MJ Network illustrates the complex genealogical relationships among haplotypes found for cpDNA and ITS (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35113-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The most ancestral haplotypes are expected to located at central position within a haplotype network, geographically widespread and consequently have more mutational connections to other haplotypes. Thus, H6, D7, and D9 may be the most ancestral haplotypes for the cpDNA and ITS data set, respectively.
