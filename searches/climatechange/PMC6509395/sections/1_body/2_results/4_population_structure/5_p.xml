<p class="p">In analysis of SSRs, according to the Nei's genetic similarity coefficients and genetic distance, the relationship between populations SB, LY, CM, ZW, and AZQ is closest (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35113-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>). The UPGMA tree showed that the 17 populations could be divided into three groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35113-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>): The first group consists of populations from the Tarim Basin, including WQ, WS, BC1, BC2, KC, and LT; the second group consists of the Hexi Corridor and the Hami Basin, including SF, HM1, HM3, AKS, JYG, and GT; the third group consists of the Hexi Corridor and Alxa Desert populations, including SB, LY, CM, ZW, and AZQ. According to the STRUCTURE analysis, when the 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> value is equal to 3, the Deltak value is the largest (Supporting information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35113-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Therefore, Bayesian clustering approach revealed that there are three groups in the population of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35113-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The Bayesian approach showed a similar grouping pattern with that displayed by the UPGMA tree. The AMOVA results (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35113-tbl-0006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>) show that the maximum variation of the population of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> occurred within individuals was 72.39304%, while 15.22903% of variation occurred among groups. Mantel tests showed that geographical isolation was significantly associated with genetic distance (
 <italic class="italic">r = </italic>0.1362; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0009) in all population of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic>. The geographical isolation and genetic distance were also significantly correlated with the populations of 
 <italic class="italic">G. przewalskii</italic> in the Tarim Basin (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.1168; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0169).
