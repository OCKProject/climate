<p class="p">The LGM potential distribution of the species was predicted by CCSM and MIROC models. Compared with the present potential distribution, the LGM distribution showed a general range contraction. Both CCSM and MIROC models showed that all these suitable areas were isolated from each other. Overall, the range of potential distributions is associated with glacial cycles; the distribution range contracted under glacial conditions and expanded during interglacials.</p>
