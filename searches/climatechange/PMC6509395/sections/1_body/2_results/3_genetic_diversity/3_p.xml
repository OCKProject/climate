 <xref rid="ece35113-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="ece35113-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. For cpDNA, 19 haplotypes were private, and the remainder were shared by two or more populations. Five haplotypes (H5, H6, H9, H18, and H21) were widely distributed. The haplotype H6 was the most widespread, distributed throughout the Hami Basin and Hexi Corridor; H9 was also distributed through the Hexi Corridor. The haplotypes H18 and H21 were found in the Tarim Basin, and H5 was distributed in the Alxa Desert. For ITS, 16 haplotypes were private. Two (D7, D9) were widely distributed, occurring throughout the Central Tarim Basin, Hami Basin, and Hexi Corridor.
