<p class="p">In the SSR analysis, a total of 69 alleles were obtained across 17 populations, with an average of 11.5 alleles per locus. The number of effective alleles of six loci ranged from 2.1348 to 8.2979, with an average of 4.4909. The observed and expected heterozygosities range from 0.3407 to 0.7279 and from 0.5335 to 0.8827, respectively (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35113-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). The number of alleles per population ranged from 3.1667 to 4.6667, with an average of 3.8333. The observed and expected heterozygosities range from 0.3750 to 0.7292 and 0.4917 to 0.7139, respectively. The allele abundance ranged from 2.56 to 3.69.
