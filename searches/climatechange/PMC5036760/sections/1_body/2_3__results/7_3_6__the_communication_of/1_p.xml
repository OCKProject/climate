<p class="p">Interviewees were asked about the drivers associated with the communication of climate policy, and whether health benefits and healthcare savings might be a useful communications frame in communicating policy decisions. Aside from the policy areas of vehicle emissions standards and energy efficiency, most interviewees argued that the use of health co-benefits to justify the implementation of mitigation policies would be limited. Most reasons provided focused on the same issues identified as barriers for the consideration of health co-benefits in the development of mitigation policies—issues around a lack of robust domestic data, the indirect nature of health co-benefits, as well as Australia’s current climate change narrative and mitigation policy approach:

Um, I think with the current government’s policies as they are, you know, the reason they’re emphasizing things like agricultural productivity and energy productivity is because, as you know, it’s a sort of very direct action approach, and the, the communications are emphasizing that um, we can reduce emissions um, by taking direct action, and by taking direct action we’re actually helping farmers and um, and we’re helping businesses to continue to grow…I don’t think selling health um, outcome, or telling, talking about health outcome would work in the context of the government’s current policies and, and targets, cos I, I suspect um, any analysis of health benefits of action would probably say the targets aren’t high enough to achieve much benefit…”</p>
