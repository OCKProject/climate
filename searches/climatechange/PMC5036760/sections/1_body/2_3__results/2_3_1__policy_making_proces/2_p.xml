<p class="p">A number of interviewees also made the distinction between quantifying costs and benefits, and how this impacts upon their consideration in a RIS: 
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“…usually you can quantify the costs relatively well…and then, you can usually quantify some benefits relatively easily but then there tends to be a whole class of benefits that are difficult to quantify, and what you will often do in a regulatory impact statement is reference them qualitatively but not try and quantitatively [value] them…Now sometimes that would be because your benefits already exceed your costs, so you can consider them upside, but other times that’s purely because you don’t have the data, and if you try to put the case up, then, you know, if you, if you depend on that and you don’t, you don’t have enough actual support, then it could undermine your policy because, you know, it’s a piece, it’s like better not to…depend on something if you can’t defend it.”</p>
