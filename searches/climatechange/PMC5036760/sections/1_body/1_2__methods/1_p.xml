<p class="p">Theoretically, we situate this research within the political economy of health, which provides a robust framework in which to explore health within the climate change agenda. Health is inherently political in nature given “power is exercised over it as part of a wider economic, social and political system” [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-13-00927" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] (p. 187). The political economy of health framework contends that both good and ill health are a “result of social, political, and economic structures and relations” [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-13-00927" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] (p. 134) that can be easily overlooked given health is often defined in a functional and individualistic manner [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-13-00927" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] (pp. 34–35). To support the application of this theoretical framework, a complementary analytical framework was identified and used to inform the research project. A previous analysis of health factors in climate change policy has been undertaken by Morrow and Bowen [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-13-00927" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] who investigated the consideration of health in Fijian climate change policies. In line with their approach, the development of this case study is underpinned by Walt and Gilson’s [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-00927" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] policy analysis framework (see
