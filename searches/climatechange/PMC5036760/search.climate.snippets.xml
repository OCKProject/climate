  <result pre="the role of health co-benefits in the development of Australian" exact="climate" post="change mitigation policies. To do so, we explored the"/>
  <result pre="champions both within and outside of government; the current Australian" exact="climate" post="change narrative and a focus on domestic economic costs"/>
