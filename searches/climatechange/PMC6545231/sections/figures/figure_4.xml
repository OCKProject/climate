  <title class="title">Vulnerability in the climatic thread of drainage floods.</title>
  <p class="p">The vulnerability for the climatic threat of drainage floods in the 16 districts of Beijing shows that the vulnerability in 2016 increases significantly by 5%â€“10% compared to 2008, except the district of Shunyi, where the Beijing Capital International Airport is located and where its vulnerability decreased in the past 10 years, due to the high level drainage infrastructure.</p>
