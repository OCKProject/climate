  <title class="title">Dataset for Figures 4-7</title>
  <p class="p">Raw data sheet: floods, fig.-4 Data calculated by using the method in table 5 shows the vulnerability for the climatic threat of drainage floods in the 16 districts of Beijing. It shows that the vulnerability for the climatic threat of drainage floods in 2016 increases by 5%-10% compared to 2008, except the Shunyi district.</p>
  <p class="p">Raw data sheet: heatwave, fig.-5 Data calculated by using the method in table 5 shows the vulnerability for the climatic threat of heat waves in the 16 districts of Beijing. It shows that the vulnerability in 2016 increases by 10%â€“15% in all 16 districts of Beijing, compared to 2008.</p>
  <p class="p">Raw data sheet: drought, fig.-6 Data calculated by using the method in table 5 shows the vulnerability for the climatic threat of drought in the 16 districts of Beijing. It clearly indicates that vulnerability to drought in 2016 increased by about 10% compared to 2008 in the districts of urban new development area and particularly in the four districts of urban ecological conservation area, but decreases by about 10% in the urban core areas and urban extended areas.</p>
  <p class="p">Raw data sheet: integrated, fig.-7 Beijing integrated vulnerability index is calculated by the average of the sum of vulnerabilities of climatic threats of floods, heat waves and drought. Fig 7 presents the integrated vulnerability in the 16 districts of Beijing.</p>
