<p class="p">While no measure of such a complex phenomenon can be perfect, we suggest further research in this field. Firstly, it is necessary to operationalize international understanding of vulnerability within local contexts. Local communities are all in different stages of preparedness to adapt to climate change. They need to understand locally vulnerability, and should have the tools to identify the influence of local governmental policies on local vulnerability through a process of bottom-up changes. For supporting local understanding and assessment of vulnerability, it is suggested that future IPCC report could attach a technical guideline on vulnerability assessment that can be directly used in or adapted to local conditions. Contextualization of international understanding and approaches can inform local adaptation policy and help incorporating climate futures in planning, and thus provide support to achieving SDG targets on climate change and urbanization.</p>
