  <p class="p">The IOM result depicted in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> shows that priority climatic threats are urban drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and water scarcity and drought in Beijing. Therefore the main source for adapting to climate change in Beijing is increasing the adaptive capacity to be able to respond to heavy rains and drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and water scarcity and drought. The IOM results revealed that the most harmful climatic threat was historically urban floods in Beijing. However this is changing recently and high temperature and heat waves are going to be the most harmful climatic threat as indicated in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>.

  <p class="p">Vulnerability to high temperature and heat waves in 2016 increased significantly (
   <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test result for the long-term trend) by 10%–15% in all 16 districts of Beijing compared to 2008. High vulnerability to heat waves is observed in the urban core areas of the districts Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to high sensibility and high exposure in these two districts.
