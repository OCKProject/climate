<p class="p">The stakeholders are related to the main vulnerable sectors: urban water supply, communication and information, transportation, energy supply, sewage and drainage, solid waste collection and treatment, health, insurance, urban green and biodiversity, food production and supply, buildings and build-up area, governance and management, poverty reduction and management and tourism. The preliminary IOM on priority climatic threats in Beijing is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, which shows that the priority climatic threats in Beijing are urban drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and water scarcity and drought. Therefore the main sources for adapting to climate change in Beijing are suggested to allocate means to increase adaptive capacities of responding to heavy rain and drainage floods, high temperature and heat waves and to solve the consequences of water scarcity after droughts. Other climatic threats such as heavy snow and frost, windstorm, wildfires, may be also included in the urban adaption action plan by allocating certain resources, e.g., finance and services.
