 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the most vulnerable sectors are water supply, waste management, health, energy supply and tourism in the case of high temperature and heat waves, and sewage, waste management, health, insurance, build-up area, transportation and tourism in the case of drainage and floods, and water supply, insurance, health and forest and ecosystem in the case of water scarcity and drought. Aggregate average scores in 
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> show that there is no significant difference among most sectors in vulnerability to climate change, since the coefficient of variation (C.V.) is 13.0% that is less than 15%. Significant difference exists in each of the climatic threats, since CV is 31.8% in the case of heatwave, 27.8% in the case of floods and 48.4% in the case of drought. The research result suggests the municipality of Beijing should take an integrated approach to climate adaptation, instead of sectoral actions.
