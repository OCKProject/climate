<p class="p">For identifying vulnerable sectors and groups, a one-day workshop that has been described in the ‘UVI Development: Theory and Data Collection Method’ section was organized. At the end of the workshop day, each participant made his or her own selection of vulnerable sectors and groups. Based on the selection of each participant, the research team determines the aggregate average score, and the final result is based on the aggregate average score, which is presented in
