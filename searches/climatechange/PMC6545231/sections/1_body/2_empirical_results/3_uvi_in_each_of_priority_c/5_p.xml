<p class="p">Beijing integrated vulnerability index is calculated by the average of the sum of vulnerabilities of climatic threats of floods, heat waves and drought. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> presents that the integrated vulnerability in the 16 districts increased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test result for the long-term trend: 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> = 22.69 &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> − 2 = 7) = 2.365). The UVI in the case of heat waves is highest and it is obviously increasing during the period of 2008 –2016, given to the factors of increasing sensibility (e.g., increasing of numbers of day and night of heat waves annually, limited green space, and increasing of high-rise buildings) and of exposure (e.g., increasing of population density and population above 65 years old, increasing of outdoor workers). Although adaptive capacity in all 16 districts is increasing, the increase is not enough to overcome the increase in both sensibility and exposure. The integrated UVI in the case of drought is almost stabilized, due to that fact that this UVI decreases in the urban core areas and increases in the urban outskirt of ecological conservation areas. The integrated UVI in the case of floods increases slowly, due to the fact that the increase of both sensibility and exposure increases the UVI and the improvement of urban drainage services and governance capacity decreases the UVI.
