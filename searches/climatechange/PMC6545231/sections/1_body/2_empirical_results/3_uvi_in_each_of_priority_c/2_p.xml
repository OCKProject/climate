High vulnerability to the threat of drainage of floods is observed in the urban core areas (downtown) of two districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to the factors of high percentage of paved areas (high sensibility), high population density and high percentage of population above 65 years (high exposure) and old or very old urban drainage system (lower adaptive capacity) that was built 40 years ago.
