<p class="p">An urban vulnerability index (UVI) that measures vulnerability to climate changes is a crucial part of the adaptation capacity building process. An UVI is an assessment, information and monitoring tool. As an assessment tool, it helps identify risks and vulnerabilities. As an information tool, it can better instruct the design of early-warning systems and adaptation action plan as well as raise awareness and communicate about vulnerability and risks. As a monitoring tool, it can identify how well a city has responded and recovered to disasters and shocks and whether the targets have been met. Hence, an UVI plays a role during the whole adaptation capacity building process. By applying the three-dimension framework presented in
