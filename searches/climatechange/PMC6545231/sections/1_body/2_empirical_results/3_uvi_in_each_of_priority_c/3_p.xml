<p class="p">Data of vulnerability for the climatic threat of high temperature and heat waves is presented in

 <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test result for the long-term trend:

 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05,

High vulnerability to heat waves was observed in the urban core areas of districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, due to high percentage of high-rise building and limited green areas (high sensibility), high percentage of population above 65 years old and relative high percentage of outdoor workers (high exposure). Lower vulnerability in heat waves observed in the district of Yangqing, which is the core ecological conservation area with high green area, less population density and less high-rise buildings. Most districts are in middle vulnerability with value between 0.4–0.6. There are relative low vulnerability in districts of urban new development area and in the ecological conservation area of districts of Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun. These districts have low exposure and low sensibility. In practice, these districts are the main ecological conservation and recreation areas in Beijing.
