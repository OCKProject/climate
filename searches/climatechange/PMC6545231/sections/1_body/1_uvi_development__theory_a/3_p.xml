<p class="p">A two-steps approach was applied for the preliminarily selection of individual indicators. The first step is to do a literature review selecting individual indicators for climatic threats related vulnerable systems/sectors and vulnerable groups/individuals. By the literature reviews, we have selected preliminary 26 individual indicators for assessing urban vulnerability to the threat of floods, 32 indicators for assessing urban vulnerability to the threat of heat waves and 29 individual indicators for assessing vulnerability to the threat of drought. All those preliminary selected 87 indicators, together with a brief description of each indicator were distributed to the participants before the workshop. The second step is to adopt an expert approach and achieve stakeholdersâ€™ participation as described above. The experts and stakeholders present their own understanding and comments and finally they make their own scoring for each of indicators, based on the criteria: (1) the indicators are closely related to the issue, (2) they are independent of one another, (3) relevant in the context of Beijing, (4) measurable and (5) the data are available. Based on the sum of the scores of each indicators, the final 23 indicators were selected for measuring urban vulnerability.</p>
