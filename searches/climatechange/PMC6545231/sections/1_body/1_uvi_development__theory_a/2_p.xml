<p class="p">Climate change has different meaning for different cities and different cities face different priority climate themes. In this study, Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM), together with stakeholders’ participation is applied to identify key climatic threats or priority climate themes that Beijing is facing. IOM is based on historical data of direct economic loss of climatic events, in particular the data concerning the last 12 years in the Beijing Annual Natural Disaster Report. Following the identification of priority climate themes, a one day workshop was organized by the Beijing Climate Change Response Research and Education Centre, of the Beijing University of Civil engineering and Architecture for allowing expert judgment and stakeholders’ participation for identifying vulnerable sectors and groups. Title of this workshop was Vulnerable Sector and Groups: How Beijing Adapt to Climate Change and it took place on 14 April 2017. 30 participants attended the workshop. Among the 30 participants who are all senior experts, 24 (two from each sector) are from sectors like water supply and sewage, waste management, public health, energy supply, urban green and biodiversity, forest and ecosystem, tourism, nature conservation, information and communication, insurance, transportation and education and six are experts recommended by China National Expert Committee on Climate Change Adaptation (CECCCA). Participants were selected on criteria like (1) at least 5 years working experiences in natural disaster governance or climate adaptation, (2) good knowledge of indicator development and index processing, (3) have participated in development of its sectoral strategies and policies on climate change adaptation. Before making a judgment participants listened to a presentation of this research and were discussing vulnerability issues allowing an intensive exchange of ideas between stakeholders and experts.</p>
