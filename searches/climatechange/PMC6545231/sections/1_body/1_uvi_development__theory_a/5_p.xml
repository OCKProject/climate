<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, the AHP objective (first hierarchy) is to measure urban sensibility for the threat of floods under three principles (second hierarchy) of (1) relevance, (2) scientifically sound and (3) applicable to users by using weighted individual indicators (third hierarchy) of annual rainstorm hours (indicator (1), percentage of paved area (indicator (2) and risk of secondary disasters caused by heavy precipitation (indicator (3). Relevance is explained as directly related to the issue, based on a known linkage between the indicator and sensibility and sensitive to changes in the conditions of interest. Scientifically sound is explained as unbiased and representative of the conditions of concern, scientifically credible, so that they cannot be easily challenged in terms of their reliability or validity, based on data of a known and acceptable quality and consistent and comparable over time and space. Applicable to users is explained as based on data which are available at an acceptable cost-benefit ratio, easily understood and applicable by potential users, acceptable to stakeholders and available soon after the event or period to which it relates (so that policy decisions are not delayed). Experts and stakeholders compare the three individual indicators against each of the three principles by using the AHP scoring rule in
