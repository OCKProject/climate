<p class="p">The major research question is in which way we can measure urban vulnerability in Beijing. Subquestions concern the role of floods, the role of heat waves and the role of droughts. 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kropp et al. (2009)</xref> developed heat wave indicator within the scope of a climate change vulnerability study for North Rhine Westphalia. However, this indicator does not cover the three components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. In our research, we propose that vulnerability could be assessed by the dimensions of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure is determined solemnly by climatic threats or issues (e.g., heat wave, urban flooding, drought, etc.). The sensitivity is determined by characteristics of sectors, systems and group of people that are directly or indirectly influenced by climatic threats. The adaptive capacity of a system is determined by the system’s capacity to adjust to climatic threats including the ability to learn from experience or information and hence to reduce its sensitivity. Both exposure and sensitivity lead to more vulnerability, while increased adaptive capacity diminishes vulnerability. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the procedures we developed to guide the assessment of vulnerability. We separate the procedure to do the assessment from the methods used to come up with the necessary data.
