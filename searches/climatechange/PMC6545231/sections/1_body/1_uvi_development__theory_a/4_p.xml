<p class="p">A frequently mentioned challenge in indicator programmes (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Dijk, 2014</xref>) is how the index’s inputs should be weighted. In most of international indicator programmes, nominally all inputs into an index receive equal weight. No indicator gets more weight than any other. An environmental sustainability index programme implemented jointly by the World Economic Forum’s global Leaders for Tomorrow Environment Task Force, the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, and the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) has also addressed the issue of weighting indicators (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">World Economic Forum, 2001</xref>). However the result is not acceptable for two reasons. One is that weights identified by different experts from different countries are very likely to differ significantly. This is because the situation is different from one country to another. Another reason for getting poor results is probably that vulnerability is a complicated issue and may lead to confusion among different experts. The reason for opting for a weighting approach for the aggregation of the selected indicators are twofold. One to allow cross-urban comparisons. Most Chinese cities are quite similar in terms of climatic threats, economic growth, social progress, institutional capability and governance. Therefore a scientifically acceptable determination of the weights should be achieved. Secondly we used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, together with consultation of experts. One of the main advantages of the AHP is that it allows experts to compare two factors by using the same criteria and scoring rule. As the identification with the same criteria and scoring rule is quite simple, statistical results can easily be obtained at an acceptable level. As an example,
