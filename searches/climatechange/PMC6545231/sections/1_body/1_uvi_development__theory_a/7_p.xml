<p class="p">The composite UVI combines numbers of individual indicators measured in different units into a single number between 0 and 1. 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kropp et al. (2009)</xref> uses fuzzy logic techniques for this combination in order to account for a quantification of uncertainties. Kropp notes that “these techniques allow for gradual instead of binary allocation of variable values to classes”. For example in a region where life expectancy of 25 years old is classified as low and life expectancy of 85 years old is classified as high. A practical value in between these two thresholds is then allocated to the class ‘life expectancy’ according to a linear function that could for example result in the number ‘0.5’ for the value 55 years old.
