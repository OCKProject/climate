<p class="p">The majority of vulnerability assessments focuses on international, national and regional levels and it is necessary to downscale to the community level for supporting local policy framing and adaptation actions (

We go beyond the IPCC framing of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity by developing indicators for them. We have communicated this research results with local stakeholders and the feedback shows that vulnerability assessment on a grid scale is much needed, since it provides crucial information for policy makers and stakeholders to take local actions. We argue that, for improving policy relevance and intensifying linkages of the assessment and local action, urban vulnerability assessments need to downscale to the street level. In this regard, combining IBVA with GIS is called for in the future, since GIS could provide data on very small scale, e.g., on scale of one km
