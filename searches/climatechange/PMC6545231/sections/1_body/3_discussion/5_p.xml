<p class="p">The results generated by this research indicate that Beijing is highly exposed to multiple climate threats in the context of global climate change, specifically urban high temperature and heat waves, heavy rain and urban drainage floods and reduced precipitation and drought. This vulnerability assessment, which addressed priority climatic threats in Beijing, provides a holistic understanding of the susceptibility to climate change that could be a guidance for facilitating future adaptation.</p>
