<p class="p">The vulnerability assessment has dominated climate change adaptation programmes at various levels of community, city, region, country and the world as a whole (

The IPCC definition defines three components of sensibility, exposure and adaptive capacity of vulnerability. The advantages of the IPCC definition are that it is easy to communicate and results can be compared. The limitation is that the three components lack policy relevance. For linking the assessment to adaptation policies and actions, multi-dimensional vulnerability has been defined and multi-dimensional vulnerability encompasses physical, economic, social, environmental and institutional features (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Birkmann, 2005</xref>). It is obvious that a multi-dimensional vulnerability assessment needs more indicators and data than the three-dimensional model developed in this article. From definition to practical assessment, the most important challenge facing vulnerability assessments is how to contextualize a definition for the local level, community or district level and even street level. This article started from the 87 indicators selected from literature and, by contextualization, finally 23 indicators are selected for assessing vulnerability to climate change. We argue that the three-dimensional model requires limited indicators and data and thus it is better fitting with cities and communities where data is lacking.
