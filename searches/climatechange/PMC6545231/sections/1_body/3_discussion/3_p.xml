<p class="p">In this research the Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM) together with stakeholdersâ€™ participation is proven effective to define priority climatic threats. Applying IOM requires collection of high-quality historical data. IOM could provide direct effects of climate disaster and thus it help to communicate with policy makers and stakeholders and helps to understand climate threats that a city may face. By applying IOM, priority climate threats have been identified and thus we capture the key features of vulnerability. Hence it provides valuable and reliable information on vulnerability to difference climatic threats at the city and district level.</p>
