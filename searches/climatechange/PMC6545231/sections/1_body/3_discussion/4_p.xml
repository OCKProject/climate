<p class="p">The selection of primary indicators is based on a literature study and the reduction and weighting of indicators were the result of a combined experts’ opinions, stakeholders’ participation and using AHP. There are limitations in aggregating weighted indicators using the additive approach that is mainly based on Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tonmoy, El-Zein &amp; Hinkel, 2014</xref>). Indicators should be independent and there should be a precise mathematical relationship between indicators. In the literature, most indicator-based vulnerability assessments use MAUT for aggregation of indicator despite the fact that IBVA rarely satisfies MAUT. In our study, we have introduced the criterion of indicator independence in the preliminary selection of indicators. We argue that MAUT is applicable to aggregation of indicators, since all IBVA in vulnerability studies are empirical. However, one must be very careful to explain and communicate the IBVA results, since IBVA provides information more on variations of vulnerability to climate change as indicated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">7</xref>. IBVA hardly provides information on the absolute value of vulnerability.
