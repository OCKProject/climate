However, if measuring vulnerability wants to take all dimensions of vulnerability into account, a considerable number of indicators for measuring of vulnerability is required. The challenge is to deal with two controversial issues. One, the growing complexity of the definition of urban vulnerability related to climate change and secondly, the practical demand for simplicity of information concerning vulnerability. There is no consensus how many indicators are needed for effective measurement of urban vulnerability. The point is to identify the essential elements that could capture the relevant information on the total system.
