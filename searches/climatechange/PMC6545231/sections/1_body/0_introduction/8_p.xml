<p class="p">The concept of vulnerability is complex and a one dimensional approach could not meet the needs of vulnerability assessment. Hence an integrated approach is necessary. This article is concerned with creating an urban vulnerability index (UVI) following a step-by-step approach in the context of urban China and intends to help policy-makers at the city and district levels to get insight in the factors determining vulnerability by measuring the progress achieved in adaptation to climate change in the urban areas. Our strategy is first to develop an urban vulnerability index, and secondly to measure empirically the UVI in Beijing, the capital city of China and its major districts. It is the first time such an assessment of vulnerability to climate change is taking place in Beijing, although there are various natural disaster risk assessments reported that use two single indicators (economic damages and mortality) without weighting. The methods developed in this research can become a useful tool for other emerging cities as well.</p>
