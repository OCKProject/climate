<p class="p">To assess vulnerability, it is crucial to define vulnerability. The most authoritative and widely quoted definition of vulnerability in the context of climate change is developed by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2007</xref>). “Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity”. The IPCC definition has significant limitations. Most critically the three components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity have not been clearly defined and thus the challenge is to develop indicators for measuring the three components mentioned above. Patt observes that “The IPCC concept in general has proven difficult to operationalize in practice” (
