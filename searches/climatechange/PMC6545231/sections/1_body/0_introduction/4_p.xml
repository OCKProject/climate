<p class="p">Two questions remain in measuring vulnerability. The first concerns “the identification of appropriate reference points from which to assess whether we are successfully enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change” (Article 7, para 2, the Paris Agreement). Reference points in emission reduction target-setting have been identified by the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Conference. However setting a reference point for adaptation requires much more and diverse information. The second question concerns the review processes for assessing vulnerability and thus measuring progress on adaptation commitments. It ”will need to balance robustness and comparability of units or indicators that capture key aspects of vulnerability and adaptive capacity with being contextually appropriate” (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Magnan &amp; Ribera, 2016</xref>). “Transparent and consistent decision-making on climate financing will require clarity on how adaptation intersects with broader development and risk reduction efforts, and thus what constitutes a progression beyond previous efforts” (Article 9, para 3, the Paris Agreement).
