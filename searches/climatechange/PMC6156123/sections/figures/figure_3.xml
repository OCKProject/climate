  <p class="p">Differential expression analysis pipeline used in this work. (Step 1) Identification of uniquely expressed transcripts (UETs) in each population and subsequent selection of transcripts expressed in individuals from both populations to be used in step 2. (Step 2) Identification of equally expressed transcripts (EETs) (5% of false discovery rate) between each pair of individuals from each population and subsequent selection of transcripts expressed in individuals from both populations to be used in step 3. (Step 3) Identification of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) (5% of false discovery rate) between the two populations.</p>
