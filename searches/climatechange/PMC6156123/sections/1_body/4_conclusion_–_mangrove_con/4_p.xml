<p class="p">The information presented in the gene co-expression network in this study may highlight genes that are candidates for the study of abiotic stress in other plant species. The gene co-expression network for a tree species developed by this work represents an advanced and promising genetic technique that can be used in the study of wetlands and other environmental stressors and in the discovery and development of heat tolerant varieties of plants.</p>
