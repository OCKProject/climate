<p class="p">The gene-specific co-expression network for each site indicates that vulnerability to climate change is not a pre-defined condition but is constructed by exposing each population to natural hazards and challenges. In this broad perspective on the need to adapt to environmental challenges, it is possible to observe that each region possesses tools in the genetic network capable of responding differently to increasing pressure from stressors. The resilience of the species includes a set of regional survival strategies to cope with present and future impacts.</p>
