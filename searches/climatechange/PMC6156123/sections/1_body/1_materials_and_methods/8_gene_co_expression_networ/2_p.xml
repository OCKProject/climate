<p class="p">The transcript co-expression network was independently analyzed for each plant organ, based on the annotation of transcripts and their tissue-specific expression levels across samples. DETs between equatorial and subtropical populations, UETs from each population and their first neighbors were highlighted in different colors in the network.

 </sup> was used to visualize the tissue-specific transcript expression classes (DET, UET and neighbors). For data handling and interpretation of the results, clusters containing transcripts associated with stress responses were selected. The enrichment of GO terms in the network was analyzed using the R package
