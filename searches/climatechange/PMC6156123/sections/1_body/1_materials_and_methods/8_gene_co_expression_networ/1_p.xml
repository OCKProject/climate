<p class="p">A single co-expression network was generated based on the EM values of all the transcripts from all the samples sequenced in the RNA-Seq experiment. Transcripts showing &gt; 50% null values in the samples were excluded to reduce noise and eliminate residuals in the analysis. Following noise removal, the Pearson’s correlation values between each pair of transcripts for each plant organ (roots, stems, leaves, meristems, and flowers) were used to construct a co-expression network. Transcripts in the network were clustered using the Heuristic Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA). The highest reciprocal classification (HRR) method proposed by 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mutwil et al. (2009)</xref> was employed to select only edges representing the strongest correlations (VALUE ≤ 30), where an HRR of less than or equal to 3 was used to empirically filter the edges.
