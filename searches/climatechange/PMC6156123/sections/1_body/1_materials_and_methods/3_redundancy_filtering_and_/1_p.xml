<p class="p">After assembling the reads into longer contigs, we filtered the consensus assembly to reduce artefactual redundancy. Additionally, we identified the putative coding sequences (CDS) from the transcripts using the TransDecoder program (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haas et al., 2013</xref>). Similar transcripts were clustered with a customized Perl script, using a similarity threshold of 95% and requiring 90% of the length of the redundant sequence to align with the longest sequence. We retained only the transcript containing the longest putative CDS sequence present in each cluster.
