<p class="p">The equatorial sampling site is located in the Eastern American geographic region, where abiotic conditions are optimal for the occurrence of mangroves. During the collection of plant material at this sampling site, the forests were observed to be in advanced stages of development, with densely distributed trees, most of which were over 10 m tall. In contrast, the subtropical sampling site is at the southernmost edge of the distribution of the species in the Eastern American region; individuals in this population have a sparse distribution and rarely reach 10 m tall.</p>
