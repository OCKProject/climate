<p class="p">These sampling sites differ remarkably in the annual variation of key climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and insolation (

 </bold>). Seasons are marked by dry and humid periods in the equatorial region, whereas cold and warm periods mark the seasonality in the subtropical region. The collection of plant material was conducted from July 26th to August 24th of 2014, at the beginning of the dry season at the equatorial site and at the end of winter at the subtropical site. To obtain a wide variety of 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembled transcripts, we sampled five distinct plant organs from each of the six collected plants, namely, the apical meristems of the branches, leaves, mature flowers, stems, and fine roots. As natural laboratories, these sampling sites provided ideal environments to examine the differences in gene expression that occur as a response in plants subjected to distinct historical stress conditions. Additionally, the equatorial site is located at the approximate distribution range center of 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> along the Atlantic coast of the American continent, and the subtropical site is located at the southernmost edge of its distribution range along the Atlantic coast of the American continent (

 </bold>). Therefore, this experimental design allowed us to assess the environmental drivers of stress at the range center vs. the range edge.
