<p class="p">Roots, stems, apical meristems, flowers and leaves were sampled under field conditions and immediately stored in individual Falcon tubes filled with an RNA stabilizing solution (RNAlater, Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, United States) and later processed in a laboratory. Total RNA was isolated from each sample using the Plant RNA Isolation Mini Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States). A NanoVue
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> device (Spectrophotometers Plus, GE Healthcare) was used to determine the RNA purity and concentration. To analyze the integrity of the samples, RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Visualization of clear rRNA bands without traces (indicating degradation or contamination by genomic DNA) confirmed that the RNA quality was sufficiently high for the RNA to be used in cDNA sequencing.
