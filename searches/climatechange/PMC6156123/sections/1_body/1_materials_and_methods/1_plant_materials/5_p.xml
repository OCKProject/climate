<p class="p">Three individuals were sampled per sampling site (equatorial and subtropical) during low tide from areas with diverse physiognomies to characterize the general patterns of gene expression at each location. The trees were located in slightly flooded to moderately flooded areas and sandy to muddy soils. The position of each tree was recorded by a GPS receiver (Garmin: GPSMAP 76CS, Garmin International, Inc., Olathe, KS, United States). The sample coordinates, environmental data at the moment of sampling and characteristics of each sampled individual are available in
