<p class="p">To validate the RNA-Seq experiment results, we used real-time reverse transcription qPCR (qRT-PCR) on ten reference genes and a total of fifteen DETs, with seven DETs from the leaves and eight DETs from the roots. The selected loci were homologous to the proteins described in

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000</xref>), with a target amplicon size of 70â€“150 bp and an optimal primer length of 20 bp. We performed qRT-PCR on the same RNA samples that were used for the RNA-Seq experiments. qRT-PCR amplification efficiency tests of all the primer pairs were performed using the reverse-transcribed mRNA (cDNA).
