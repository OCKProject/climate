<p class="p">Differential expression analysis was conducted to compare the tissue-specific transcript expression profiles from the equatorial and subtropical samples. FPKM values (from RSEM) were used separately for each of the six sampled trees and their different plant organs (roots, stems, leaves, meristems, and flowers). This analysis was conducted in three distinct steps. The first step was to identify the uniquely expressed transcripts (UETs) at each sampling site (

  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The UETs were the transcripts expressed in all individuals and tissues from a given population that were absent from all samples from the other population. The second step was to select the equally expressed transcripts (EETs) among all three individuals sampled from each sampling site, to reduce the effects of local environmental variation on the gene expression in trees at the same sampling site. Only EETs present in all pairwise comparisons were used in the following step of the analysis to reduce the differences found among the individuals (genotypes) (

 </bold>). The third step was to identify differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between the overlapping EETs from the contrasting populations.
