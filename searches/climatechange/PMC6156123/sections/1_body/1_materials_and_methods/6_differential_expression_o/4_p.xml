<p class="p">This step was conducted using the posterior probability of equal expression (PPEE) value calculated with EBSeq (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>), using an FDR &lt; 0.05 and a fold-change &gt; 1.5 as cut-off values. Thus, only transcripts that were expressed in all individuals from both populations were used in the differential expression analysis. The three individuals sampled from each location were treated as biological replicates after the selection of EETs (
