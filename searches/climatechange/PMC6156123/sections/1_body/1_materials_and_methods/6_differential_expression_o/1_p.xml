<p class="p">Bowtie 2 (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used to map the high-quality paired-end reads from each sequence library to the transcriptome, and we recorded only the best alignment for each read. The ratio of reads mapped to the assembly is a useful criterion for evaluating the quality of the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembled sequences. The number of reads mapped to each assembled contig was used for RNA-Seq expression analysis (
