<p class="p">Raw paired-end 72-bp reads were obtained from image data and transformed from base calling into raw sequence data. High-quality reads were filtered from the raw data through the removal of low-quality reads and adapter sequences using the

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chevreux et al., 1999</xref>). The minimum contiguous sequence (contig) size was set to 200 with at least 10x read coverage. A consensus transcriptome assembly was constructed based on the overlapping transcripts between the Mira and Trinity assemblies, using 100% BLASTN identity and 95% sequence overlap similarity as the thresholds (
