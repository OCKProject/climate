<p class="p">Following confirmation of the RNA-Seq results by qRT-PCR, the transcripts abundance data were used as the input for both the construction of a co-expression network, based on the pairwise Pearson’s correlations of the transcripts, and for the comparison of transcript expression levels between the two natural populations of the species, one located at the range center and one at the southern edge of the range of the species. In the differential expression analysis, we compared trees sampled under field conditions from contrasting latitudes in the equatorial and subtropical regions of the Atlantic coast of South America (see the Materials and Methods). Focusing our analyses on the differences in abiotic factors at these two sites, which were possibly associated with the observed differential regulation of transcript expression levels in the sequenced samples, we found some interesting results that were corroborated by the structure of the co-expression network (see

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </bold>). The correlation network of the transcripts with different expression levels between the two populations indicated that different groups of putative genes may be involved in the response to divergent stress factors in these two sites. Predicting the effects of climate change on natural populations is challenging, especially when other global issues are also considered, such as increasing sea pollution and the increasing human population (
