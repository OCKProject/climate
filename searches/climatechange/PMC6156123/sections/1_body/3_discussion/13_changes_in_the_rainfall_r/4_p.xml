<p class="p">With alterations in rainfall levels in the subtropical seasons, the importance of the ent-kaurene synthase gene must be emphasized as it is linked to viviparity. The ent-kaurene synthase gene is expressed only in the mangroves in the subtropical region and has been reported to be undergoing positive selection in
