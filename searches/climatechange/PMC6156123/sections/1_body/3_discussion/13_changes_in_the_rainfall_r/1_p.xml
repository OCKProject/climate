<p class="p">Mangrove forests in the humid tropics have higher biomass and productivity than those in areas that are more arid or have less rainfall, such as subtropical Brazil (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alongi, 2015</xref>). The rainfall deficit and high salinity predicted for northern (equatorial) Brazil could lead to the loss of mangrove areas due to reduced primary productivity and seedling survival and changes in interspecific competition. These systems are already facing less rainfall and a decreased frequency of extreme precipitation events due to the inter-annual climate variability that is strongly driven by El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (
