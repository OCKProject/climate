<p class="p">Equatorial samples were more efficient at vacuolar accumulation of Na+, with upregulated expression of H+-ATPase (ATPase H+) genes. Vacuolar accumulation of Na+ is an important tool for maintaining the homeostasis of the ions inside the cell in the mangroves (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parida and Jha, 2010</xref>). The cell walls in equatorial plants respond to the current high levels of rainfall; however, in the future, they will have to respond to the expected drought in the region. Water deficits and higher salinity can lead to increased evapotranspiration and decreased primary productivity. These metabolic responses can completely alter how

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alongi, 2015</xref>). In subtropical Brazil, where precipitation rates are expected to increase, the radicular system, which is relatively shallow, may be more vulnerable to wave action (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 2002</xref>). There was a set of genes among the UETs that were responsive to auxin, an important plant hormone that provides a key signal for the formation of lateral roots in many plants. Auxin maintains the homeostasis and directional transport of ions and is essential for plant growth and development (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krishnamurthy et al., 2017</xref>). Among the auxin-responsive UETs found in the samples from the subtropical region were the following: “indole-3-acetic acid-induced protein,” “auxin response factor 18,” “auxin-induced protein 5NG4,” “auxin transporter,” “auxin-binding protein ABP20” and “auxin response factor 8-like.” The expression of these genes can be increased by the development of thicker lateral roots based on environmental demand.
