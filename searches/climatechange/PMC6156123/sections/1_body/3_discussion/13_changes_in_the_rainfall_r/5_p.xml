 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al. (2017)</xref> also reported positive selection acting on the SUMO-activating enzyme 2 (SAE2) gene in another Rhizophora species. The expression of SAE2 was found in samples from the subtropical region. The investment of this Rhizophoreae population in specific AA substitutions shows the importance of proteomic modifications to their responses to local selective pressures.
