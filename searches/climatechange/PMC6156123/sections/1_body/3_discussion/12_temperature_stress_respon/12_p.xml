<p class="p">Cluster 32 was associated with many genes that were DETs and UETs in the root samples from the subtropical population and with “non-photochemical quenching,” which is linked to the essential regulation of a high light stress photoprotection mechanism. This response in subtropical root samples may be associated with the continuous exposure of the roots to light when the level of the incoming tide is low (
