<p class="p">This adjustment of the different selective pressures seems to be an advantage for subtropical mangrove plants. The absence of adaptive adjustments may be a problem for plants in the equatorial region, which, similar to other basic plant species, must direct most of their efforts to adapting to high temperatures. There may be declines in the yields of tropical plants and increases in the yields of temperate plants that seem to apply to the survival of the mangrove (
