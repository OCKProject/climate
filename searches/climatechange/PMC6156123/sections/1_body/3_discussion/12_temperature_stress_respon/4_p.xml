 </bold>) from the stem network, for example, contained transcripts that were correlated to UETs and DETs with higher expression levels in the equatorial samples than in the subtropical samples. These transcripts were associated with the GO term “response to heat” (GO: 0009408), demonstrating the correlation among putative genes responding to the same biological process. The over-expression of heat shock proteins in the equatorial samples could correlate with molecular chaperones involved in RPM1-mediated resistance. Components of the RPM1/RAR1/SGT1 complex, these super DETs may stabilize RPM1 and protect it from SGT1-mediated degradation. These super DET proteins associate with RAR1, which possesses ATPase activity and may function as a co-chaperone (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In the absence of heat shock, RAR1 negatively regulates heat-inducible genes by actively suppressing the heat acclimation function of heat shock transcription factor A1D (HSFA1D) (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yamada et al., 2007</xref>). All these chaperone mechanisms also involve the induction of the expression of heat shock transcription factor A2 (HSFA2) in response to oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nishizawa-Yokoi et al., 2010</xref>). The high expression level of heat shock proteins in the younger stems also correlates with the expression of heat-inducible genes and acclimation to excess heat, inducing the closure of stomata and modulating transcriptional and physiological responses to abscisic acid (ABA) (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bao et al., 2014</xref>). These super DETs that are heat shock proteins may assist SGT1B in the formation of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that target the immune receptors SNC1, RPS2 and RPS4 for degradation to regulate receptor levels and avoid autoimmunity (
