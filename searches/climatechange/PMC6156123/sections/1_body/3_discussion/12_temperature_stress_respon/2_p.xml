<p class="p">There is evidence in the literature of mangroves expanding poleward to their latitudinal limits (

 <italic class="italic">Avicennia marina</italic>, which expanded its distribution in southern Africa. On the eastern coast of the United States

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Osland et al. (2017)</xref> expects that mangroves at the southernmost limit of the eastern South American coast will expand southward, even though there is no evidence of recent expansion in the literature (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soares et al., 2012</xref>). The seasonal variation in air temperature increases from the equatorial to subtropical regions. Average temperatures during the day are generally above 30Â°C in the equatorial region of the Brazilian coast. Thus, continuous warming, especially in the tropical ecoregions could negatively impact mangroves due to thermal stress. Consistent with this argument, cluster 392 from the gene expression network (
