<p class="p">“Proteolysis” (GO: 0006508) is a GO term that was present in several clusters (clusters 11 and 226 of stems, 110 of meristems, 392 of leaves and 57 of flowers), and it plays an important role in the trafficking of hydrolysed proteins, balancing the recovery from stress and excessive protein degradation that results in cell death (
