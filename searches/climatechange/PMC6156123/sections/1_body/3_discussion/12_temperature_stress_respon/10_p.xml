<p class="p">In cluster 98, in samples from the subtropical region, we also found the enrichment of genes related to the response to freezing, which is expected since the current geographic range of mangrove indicates that excessive cold in a saline environment can severely limit the provision of water to the leaves (

In addition to this adaptation to the cold, the subtropical plants showed an over-expression of genes related to heat response and light intensity, such as the upregulated DET “photosystem II reaction center W protein” in three of the five tissues (meristem, leaf, and flower) or the highly expressed UET of “cryptochrome DASH.” High temperature stress induces oxidative damage to proteins present in photosystem II (PSII) (
