<p class="p">The higher expression levels of putative disease responsive genes in the equatorial samples than in the subtropical samples may be associated with high temperature. Heat can enhance the incidence and severity of diseases, as well as the susceptibility of the host to disease. For example, high temperature can increase stem rust and leaf rust because high temperatures are optimal for pathogen growth (
