<p class="p">For instance, a transcript similar to “heat stress transcription factor B-2B” and a transcript containing a “heat shock protein 9/12 domain” were exclusively expressed in all tissues sampled from plants from the equatorial region. Additionally, we found transcripts that were uniquely expressed in three different tissues in the equatorial samples that showed similarity to “heat shock protein 82,” “heat shock protein 83-like,” and “heat shock 70-kDa protein cognate 4.”</p>
