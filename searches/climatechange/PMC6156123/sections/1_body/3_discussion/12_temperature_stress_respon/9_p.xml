<p class="p">Cluster 98 was present in leaf genes in the equatorial samples and was associated with the GO terms “macromolecule depalmitoylation,” “response to high light intensity,” and “shikimate metabolism,” which are related to the response to high-intensity UV radiation (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tzin and Galili, 2010</xref>). Another GO term that was also present in this cluster, “pectin biosynthesis” (GO: 0045489), is also involved in the response to different stresses (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Houston et al., 2016</xref>). The term “response to UV-B” also appeared in genes in cluster 329 in leaf samples from the equatorial site.
