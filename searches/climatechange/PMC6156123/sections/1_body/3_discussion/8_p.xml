<p class="p">Our results reveal the effects of contrasting environments on gene expression in 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic>, shedding light on the different abiotic variables that may contribute to the genetic divergence previously described in the species by the use of SSR markers. These effects may be the result of two fundamental processes for adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and natural selection. These results are similar to those of previous genomic studies that demonstrated amino acid (AA) changes in the 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophoras</italic> genome, suggesting local adaptations of the functional genome in different populations of these trees. The frequent substitution of AAs suggested a rapid evolution of the proteins in mangroves. These proteins are associated with highly specialized mangrove traits for survival in intertidal habitats. The parallel evolution of the functional genomics of these mangrove species is driven by Darwinian selection (
