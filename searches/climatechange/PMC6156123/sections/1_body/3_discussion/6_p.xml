<p class="p">The lower level of the transcription of stress genes in the subtropical region than in the equatorial region may be corroborated by previous studies that report mangrove expansion toward higher latitudes at the southern boundary in Brazil in response to global climate change. The lower expression levels of putative stress response genes in samples from the subtropical region than in samples from the equatorial region may be the result of the ancient colonization of genotypes that support the conditions of a more temperate region.</p>
