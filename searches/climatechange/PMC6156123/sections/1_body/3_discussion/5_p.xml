<p class="p">The higher number of over-expressed genes in the subtropical samples than in the equatorial samples may result from a negative regulation of gene expression in response to increased environmental stress. In the equatorial region leaf samples, for example, we observed over-expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp90.2) that can be instantly inactivated when the plant experiences thermal shock (
