<p class="p">We performed a 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assembly of the 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> transcriptome using high-throughput sequencing of 30 cDNA libraries obtained from RNA extracted from five plant organs (apical meristems, leaves, stems, roots, and flowers) that were sampled from six individuals. Even though this was not the first transcriptome assembled for 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dassanayake et al., 2009</xref>), the final high-quality transcriptome presented here contains a wider representation of the speciesâ€™ transcripts than did the first published transcriptome for the species, including over 10 thousand transcribed sequences reported for the first time and over 97% of the universal orthologous plant sequences present in the OrthoDB. Additionally, we were able to annotate nearly 90% of the putative protein coding transcripts in the assembly using distinct databases, such as the non-redundant database from NCBI, the plant RefSeq database from NCBI and the Pfam database, as references. Based on their annotation, transcripts were classified into functional categories from the GO Consortium. We detected SSRs and putative SNP sites present in the transcribed sequences, which may be useful resources for further diversity studies of
