<p class="p">Differentially expressed transcript analysis showed that there was a higher abundance of transcripts associated with photosynthesis, chlorophyll and flavonoid biosynthesis, cellular respiration, photorespiration, and the cellular responses to starvation, high temperature, pectin and cellulose breakdown and disease in samples from the equatorial region than in those from the subtropical region. In contrast, compared with samples from the equatorial region, samples from the subtropical region was a higher abundance of transcripts associated with photosynthetic acclimation, the cellular response to high light conditions and starch biosynthesis. The clustering pattern can be explained by the distinct abiotic conditions to which the samples were exposed at the moment of sample collection (
