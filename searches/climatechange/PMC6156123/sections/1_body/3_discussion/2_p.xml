<p class="p">The larger number of SNP markers identified in the transcriptome of the equatorial samples than in that of the subtropical samples agrees with the greater genetic diversity found along the equatorial coast than in the subtropical region in a previously published study using neutral SSRs from

The high degree of genomic diversity in the equatorial region may be associated with the colonization history of the species or the divergence in climate between the equatorial region and the subtropical region. The equatorial mangrove population could face more relaxed selective pressures than the mangrove population at the southern edge of the distribution range, where environmental conditions may be suboptimal for the survival of the species. For this reason, the identification of polymorphic loci within transcribed regions of the genome is a valuable tool for evolutionary studies.
