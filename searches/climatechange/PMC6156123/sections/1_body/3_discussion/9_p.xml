<p class="p">We used the assembled 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome to map reads and to estimate the abundance of each assembled transcript in each of the sequenced libraries. The estimations of abundance were confirmed through qRT-PCR with cDNA obtained from the same RNA samples that were used in sequencing as a template (

 </bold>). The consistency between the estimation of the abundance of transcripts from the equatorial and subtropical samples by qRT-PCR and the expression values of the sequenced transcripts confirmed the robustness of the analysis. Our transcriptome can be used to select candidate genes for further studies on the response to heat in
