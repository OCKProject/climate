<p class="p">The interpretation of the data is based on the analysis of the transcriptional patterns found in gene co-expression networks and their relationships with the known climatic variables of the two sampling sites (

 </bold>). The genetic functions and the processes in which transcripts are involved are revealed by the enriched network clusters in addition to the DETs. The co-expression network allowed a broader view of the transcriptional differences between samples from the equatorial and subtropical regions since, in addition to the DETs, the neighboring genes were also considered with regard to the enrichment of the representative gene categories. This analysis enabled a more comprehensive analysis of all the transcripts obtained in the
