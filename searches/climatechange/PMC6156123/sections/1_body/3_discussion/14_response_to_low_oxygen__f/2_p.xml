<p class="p">The response to oxidative stress may be associated with less availability of oxygen in the soil of subtropical mangrove forests than in the soil of equatorial mangrove forests. In addition, as predictions of environmental change indicate that there will be increased flood frequency in the region, this could represent an adaptive resource for the species in this area. Cluster 32 was associated with DETs unique to roots in subtropical samples and with GO terms related to the response to plant oxidative stress, such as “oxidation-reduction process” (GO: 0055114), “microtube-based movement” (GO: 0007018), “cell cycle” (GO: 0007049), “methylation” (GO: 0032259), and “cellular amino acid metabolism” (GO: 0006520) (
