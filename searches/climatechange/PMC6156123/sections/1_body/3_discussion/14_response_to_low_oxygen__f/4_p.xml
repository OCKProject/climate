<p class="p">The roots were the only tissue in which there were more over-expressed than under-expressed genes in the subtropical samples; these genes can be visualized in the network. Root tissue is the tissue most directly affected by oxidative stress; thus, the positive regulation of genes responding to this type of stress in the subtropical samples shows that either the local pollution level or the salinity of the region demands an energy supply.</p>
