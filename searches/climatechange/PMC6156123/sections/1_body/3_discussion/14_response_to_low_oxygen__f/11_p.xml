Transcript annotations with GO terms related to the transduction of plant hormonal signals and MAPK signaling were found with UETs in all tissues from the subtropical region. These hormonal responses indicate that there is also feedback regulation of the ABA concentration that is important for the survival of mangroves because ABA accumulation is induced by environmental stimuli such as salt, oxidative stress and high temperatures (

As with other Rhizophora species, the frequent sea level fluctuations associated with climate change may have negatively affected their population sizes and played a dominant role in the evolutionary history of these mangrove trees (
