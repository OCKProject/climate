 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> is adapted to the type of environment in which the plant grows. The perpetually soaked soil in which mangroves grow has little available free oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria release nitrogen gas, soluble iron (iron), inorganic phosphates, sulfides and methane, making the soil much less nutritious than other soils. These effects are less intense in subtropical Brazil, where there is less tidal variation. The enrichment of the GO terms “response to oxidative stress” (GO: 0006979), “cell wall” (GO: 0005618) “apoplast” (GO: 0048046) and “N-terminal protein amino acid methylation” (GO: 0006480) in subtropical roots may indicate that there is an intense response to this type of stress even if the tide level is low. High salt concentrations in apoplasts and symplasts represent an advantage for mangrove plants. The enrichment of GO terms related to apoplasts in samples from the subtropical region means that these plants are working to reduce the challenge to the primary walls and cell membranes. These important adaptations for salinity tolerance influence the absorption, transport and loss of water (
