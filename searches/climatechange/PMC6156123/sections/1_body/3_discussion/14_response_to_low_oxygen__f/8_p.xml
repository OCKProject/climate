<p class="p">Cluster 179 was associated with genes in stems, leaves and meristems that were DETs unique to equatorial samples and with GO terms related to “nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolism,” “response to auxin,” and “potassium ion homeostasis,” which are important for the response to oxidative stress. In equatorial cluster 226, genes related to the “regulation of pH” (GO: 0006885) were also observed; these genes are very important given the future predictions of increased salinity in the soil in northern Brazil.</p>
