<p class="p">In turn, the root samples from equatorial mangroves showed a greater investment in ethylene-mediated signaling pathways. There were upregulated “ethylene-responsive transcription” genes in the roots and a unique expression profile of these genes in the stem and flower samples. The enriched genes linked to this signaling pathway play significant roles in salt tolerance (
