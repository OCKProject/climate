<p class="p">Cluster 91 was associated with genes in the root that were DETs unique to the subtropical samples and that were associated with many GO terms, including “cuticle development” (GO: 0042335); the cuticle provides a physical barrier against water loss and irradiation and is involved in the activation of pathogen defenses (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Serrano et al., 2014</xref>). These genes were also associated with the GO terms “light reactions” (GO: 0042548), “photosynthesis” (GO: 0015979), “cellular response to redox state” (GO: 0051775) and “NADH dehydrogenase complex” (GO: 0010258), which are involved in oxidative damage to the photosynthetic machinery and play signaling roles in the regulation of gene expression and protein function in various physiological processes of plants, including acclimatization (

The enrichment of genes linked to photosynthesis in the samples from the equatorial region indicates that the mangrove roots perform photosynthesis. Some identified genes were also related to glycerol ether metabolism, salt tolerance and “osmotic adjustments” through the accumulation of metabolites in plants (
