<p class="p">Cluster 179 was also among the five most representative clusters of the stems, leaves and meristems, and its nodes were linked to genes that were DETs that were unique to equatorial samples. The most representative GO terms associated with this cluster included “nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolism” (GO: 0000956) and “vesicle-mediated transport pathway” (GO: 0016192), which were already described by the constitutive expression of certain proteins related to increased tolerance to osmotic stress (

The GO terms “response to auxin” (GO: 0009733) and “potassium ion homeostasis” (GO: 0055075) were related to osmotic adjustments, balancing potassium homeostasis in cell growth, drought stress responses, and a high salinity response (
