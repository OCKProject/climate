<p class="p">Cluster 17 was associated with the most representative DETs unique to equatorial samples, many of which were associated with the GO term “response to absence of light” (GO: 0009646), which may be related to the lack of light during periods of flooding (

 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic>, even in a tropical region with high levels of solar radiation, has genes aimed at directing its capacity for metabolic readjustments induced by light stress (GO: 0006508); “water transport” (GO: 0006833), “lipid metabolism” (GO: 0006629), and “lignin catabolism” (GO: 0046274), which include functional groups of proteins affected by salt stress (

The genes associated with the GO term “peroxisome fission” (GO: 0016559) were also very prevalent in this cluster. In addition, peroxisomal proliferation is induced in plants by oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, ROS), UV radiation, saline stress, and even clofibrate (
