<p class="p">The significant enrichment of peroxisomal genes may be very important for the ability to effectively eliminate excess ROS due to stress responses and to protect plant cells from oxidative stress induced by prolonged flooding. Excess ROS may result in significant cellular damage, such as damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins. The upregulated transcription of “glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase” and “glutathione-Y-family DNA polymerases family” in the samples from the equatorial region may play an important role in the effective elimination and repair of damage in Rhizophoraceae mangroves caused by oxidative stress and superoxides under conditions of high salinity, high temperature and high levels of UV radiation (
