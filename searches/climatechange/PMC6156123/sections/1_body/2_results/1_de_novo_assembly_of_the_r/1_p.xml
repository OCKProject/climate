<p class="p">The combined assembly containing the contigs that overlapped between the Trinity and Mira 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> assemblies had better metrics than the isolated assemblies from each software (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The mapping of the total set of reads to the selected assembly was very high (96.87%). A similar proportion of reads obtained from the samples from each population mapped back to the final assembly, with 97.03 and 96.68% of the reads from the subtropical and equatorial population samples mapped, respectively.
