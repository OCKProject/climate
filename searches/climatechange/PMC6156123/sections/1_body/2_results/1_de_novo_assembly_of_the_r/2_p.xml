<p class="p">The completeness of the combined assembly was assessed by comparing the transcripts to the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) plant database (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sim√£o et al., 2015</xref>). BUSCO performs a quantitative analysis of how complete an assembly is based on evolutionary expectations of the content of universal single-copy orthologous genes (present in approximately 90% of plants). The 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle de novo</italic> assembly characterized herein recovered the majority orthologous sequences from the BUSCO plant dataset (97.1%), of which 94% were complete and 2.4% were fragmented sequences.
