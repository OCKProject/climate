<p class="p">To confirm the results of the RNA-Seq analysis, we determined and statistically analyzed the transcription levels of selected genes using RT-qPCR, including 15 variable genes and 10 invariable genes. The results were strongly consistent between the two methods, with 84% of the genes tested having similar expression profiles and similar categories (invariable and variable genes). Eleven out of 15 primer pairs had amplification efficiencies between 90 and 110% and were, therefore, the only primer pairs used for validation (
