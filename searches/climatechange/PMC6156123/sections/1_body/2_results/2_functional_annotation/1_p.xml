<p class="p">The assembly was blast-aligned against the NCBI Plant RefSeq Database, and 64,867 (56.1%) contigs were annotated. When the annotation redundancies were removed from each contig, 54,058 contigs (46.75%) with unique annotations were obtained. The species that presented the highest number of sequences homologous to the 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> contigs was 
 <italic class="italic">Jatropha curcas</italic> with 17,376 contigs, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Ricinus communis</italic> with 11,863 contigs and 
 <italic class="italic">Populus trichocarpa</italic> with 8,534 contigs (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </bold>). The high degree of similarity between the transcripts from 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> and these three species is expected since all four species belong to the order 
 <italic class="italic">Malpighiales</italic>. Based on the phylogeny of these species, they are taxonomically close to 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic>. This result is evidence that the transcripts of this assembly were very specific, meaning that the filtering of non-specific transcripts was efficient.
