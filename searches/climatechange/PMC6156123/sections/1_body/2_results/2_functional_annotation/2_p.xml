<p class="p">The annotation using the complete database (described in the Section “Materials and Methods”) returned 70,810 transcripts that were homologous to previously described protein sequences. Only 44,805 of the transcripts had no similarity to any sequence present in the database. In the GO analysis, we found 223,743 orthologous genes associated with 44,481 transcripts from the assembly. Of the GO terms identified, 53,767 were associated with the hierarchical category of cellular components, 79,746 were associated with molecular functions, and 90,230 were associated with biological processes (
