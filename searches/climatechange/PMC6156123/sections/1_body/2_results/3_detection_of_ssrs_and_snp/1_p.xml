<p class="p">It was possible to identify 14,283 SNPs in the transcribed regions. More SNPs were found in the equatorial samples (14,283) than in the subtropical samples (8,875), when reads from the equatorial and subtropical regions were mapped separately. On average, 10,000 SNPs were common between the regions (10,416 between equatorial samples and the total assembly and 9,690 between subtropical samples and the total assembly). Unique SNPs were also identified; 5933 were found in the equatorial samples, and 2,020 were found in the subtropical samples.</p>
