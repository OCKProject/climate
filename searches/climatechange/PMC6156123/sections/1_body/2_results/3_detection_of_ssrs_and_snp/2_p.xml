This high genomic diversity in the equatorial region may be associated with the colonization history of the species or with the environmental divergence between the equatorial region and the subtropical region. Populations in the range center (equatorial region) could face more relaxed selective pressures than populations along the southern margin of the range, where environmental conditions could be suboptimal for the occurrence of the species. In this way, the identification of polymorphic loci within the transcribed regions of the genome is a valuable tool for evolutionary studies.
