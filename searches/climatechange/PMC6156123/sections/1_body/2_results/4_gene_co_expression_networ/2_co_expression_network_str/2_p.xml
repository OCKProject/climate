<p class="p">The complete co-expression network had 78,848 transcripts correlated across 550,916 arcs, with a total of 992 clusters. When the tissue-specific analysis was performed, the partial networks of all five tissues exhibited two major clusters marked by the presence of the following: (1) DETs over-expressed in the subtropical samples and their correlated transcripts and (2) DETs over-expressed in the equatorial samples and their correlated transcripts (
