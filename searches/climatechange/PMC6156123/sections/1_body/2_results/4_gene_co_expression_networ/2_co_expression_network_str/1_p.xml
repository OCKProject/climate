<p class="p">To visualize the relationships among genes in a co-expression network, pairwise Pearsonâ€™s correlations were calculated. To simplify the analysis of differential expression between samples from distinct populations, only the first-level neighbor of each DET was chosen. The co-expression analysis was performed individually for each sampled tissue to identify the complete network of transcripts expressed in that tissue. A test was performed on the stem network to increase the correlation level to the second neighbor of each DET. The result was that a network of 3,608 genes grew to 21,512 genes. Although the correlations among the transcripts in the network structure remained the same, increasing the number of neighbors in the differential expression analyses precluded the functional interpretation of the enrichment results for GO terms.</p>
