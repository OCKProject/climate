<p class="p">The number of UETs per region varied between tissues (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). We analyzed only UETs directly connected to DETs in the network (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Thus, we focused only on the UETs associated with the differential expression found between the populations. For all tissues except the roots, we found more genes with higher relative expression levels in the equatorial samples than in the subtropical samples.
