<p class="p">It is expected that 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> individuals at the equatorial region are exposed to a more relaxed environment in terms of selective pressures in comparison to individuals living on the periphery of the species distribution, such as the subtropical zone from which plant material was sampled in this study. Stress increases as the distance from the equator increases, and one or more factors may limit the occurrence of the species.
