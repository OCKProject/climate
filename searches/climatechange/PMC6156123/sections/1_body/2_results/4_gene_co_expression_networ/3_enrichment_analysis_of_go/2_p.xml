<p class="p">The five sub-clusters that included the highest number of transcripts were analyzed for each tissue-specific co-expression network (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). Some of these most representative clusters were frequently found in more than one tissue-specific network. This result means that these clusters contained DETs and their correlated transcripts that are substantially relevant to population-level differentiation.
