<p class="p">The enrichment analysis showed 84 GO terms in both major clusters of the gene-correlation network containing DETs over-expressed in the equatorial samples and DETs over-expressed in the subtropical samples. However, the set of transcripts over-expressed in the equatorial samples was larger than the set of transcripts over-expressed in the subtropical samples for the leaves, meristems, stems and flowers. Only roots had more DETs that were over-expressed in the subtropical samples than in the equatorial samples.</p>
