<p class="p">The classification of UETs in the subtropical or equatorial samples into ontology terms frequently revealed the same categories, such as “regulation of pH,” “response to salt stress,” “oxidation-reduction process”; “cellular response to stress” and “response to heat.” However, it is clear that the trees had different sets of transcripts that were responding to similar abiotic conditions found in each of the sampling sites. The transcript correlations were distinguishable between the subtropical and equatorial samples.</p>
