 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora mangle</italic> L. (Rhizophoraceae), popularly known as the red mangrove, is the most commonly found mangrove species in the Western Hemisphere in terms of density and distribution (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sandoval-Castro et al., 2012</xref>). The genetic variability of neutral molecular markers (simple sequence repeats; SSRs) in 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> reveals the presence of two large populations in Brazil; one population is found along the northern or equatorial coast, and another extends from the north-eastern extremity of South America to the state of Santa Catarina (SC) along the subtropical Brazilian coast (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Francisco et al., 2018</xref>). There is greater genetic diversity between populations than within each population, which suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> along the Brazilian coast is not composed of a single panmictic population. The distinguishable allelic composition found in these two populations of 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle</italic> may result both from adaptation to local environmental characteristics and from stochastic factors such as genetic drift. Interestingly, the same pattern of spatial genetic structure is observed in neutral molecular markers in two other mangrove species,

 <italic class="italic">Avicennia germinans</italic> L., both of which are dispersed by ocean currents (
