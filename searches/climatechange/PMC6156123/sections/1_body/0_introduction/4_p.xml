<p class="p">The effects of these predicted scenarios on mangrove ecosystems must be carefully interpreted considering local environmental disturbances and the pressures on and characteristics of local populations. Overall increases in sea level and atmospheric temperature and changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events are predicted for both the equatorial and subtropical regions of the Brazilian coast (
