<p class="p">The potential for mangroves to adapt and survive depends on the physiological features of each species and their resilience and ability to withstand changes at the local and regional levels (

Although climate change can be subtle and difficult to identify, it is expected to greatly affect coastal species at rates that may be faster than those that allow population adaptation. The resilience of mangrove populations is tied to multiple factors, including the genomic content of each species. This study was motivated by two studies of the genetic structure of Brazilian mangroves associated with fluctuating environmental conditions (

Investigating the non-neutral regions of the genome in the equatorial and subtropical subpopulations of the mangroves of South America may reveal important features of regional abiotic stress and, thus, help to predict their future in the face of climate change.
