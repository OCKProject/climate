<p class="p">Research on individual genes cannot provide enough information to unravel the molecular mechanisms of stress resistance, which led us to conduct a natural laboratory experiment investigating the multigenic responses of mangrove plants immersed in their natural habitat. Through the presentation of a genetic correlation network obtained by examining the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> transcriptome of 
 <italic class="italic">R. mangle L</italic>., we described the patterns of gene expression in subpopulations located in the equatorial (Par√° State) and subtropical (Santa Catarina State) regions of Brazil. The two populations of mangrove trees showed divergent networks of co-expressed genes, with transcripts clustered into two main sets. Inferences regarding the threat of climate change to each local population are discussed here.
