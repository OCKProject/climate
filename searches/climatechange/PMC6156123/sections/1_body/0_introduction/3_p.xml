<p class="p">Recent genomic data have revealed a duplication of the complete genome of a 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora</italic> species that occurred approximately 70 million years ago. These studies in comparative genomics also support the extremely low diversity of populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora</italic> and other mangrove species, revealing an evolutionary future threatened by the extreme conditions of intertidal zones. The investigation of genomic data is essential to the elucidation of the history and evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation that occur in parallel in each mangrove population (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loarie et al., 2009</xref>). The accelerated rates of climate change that have been observed will influence the distribution and development of mangroves and may lead to population reductions, accompanied by a reduction in the gene pool of the species, or in some locations, to range expansions (
