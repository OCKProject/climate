<p id="Par3" class="p">As well as engaging with the academic literature, both in relation to the ethics of climate change and in relation to engineering ethics, this paper also engages directly with the community that the paper is addressing: the engineering profession. A version of this argument was presented at the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) on the 12th of June 2015, at an event which we organised with the RAEng “Engineers and Climate Change: Leadership, Ethics and Responsibilities”,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> bringing together academics and engineers from the Academy’s Fellowship.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> In addition, a version of the argument was also presented at an event at Engineers Without Borders UK on the 26th of February 2016 (and discussed further in a follow up meeting on the 6th of May 2016). Therefore, as well as engaging with the academic literature, we also respond to objections and concerns from the Fellows of the RAEng, providing philosophical responses to real world discussions that are occurring within the engineering profession. The events were held under the Chatham House Rule, so we do not identify individuals when responding to their comments (unless they have explicitly given us permission to identify them).
