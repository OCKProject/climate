<p id="Par2" class="p">We will argue that the engineering profession could, and 
 <italic class="italic">should</italic>, play a significant role in the abatement of climate change by making changes to the running of their own profession—particularly in relation to self-regulation. We will appeal to the Declaration of Helsinki by the World Medical Association (WMA), arguing that it sets a precedent for the role of a profession in addressing ethical issues. We will argue that, if the engineering profession can coordinate itself in order to set strict standards for professional engineers, and to impose sanctions for any engineers who refuse to follow these new standards (for example, revoking an engineer’s chartered status), there could be real potential to develop a coordinated response to climate change. Ultimately, we will be arguing that the engineering profession should develop a Declaration of Climate Action, comparable to the WMA’s Declaration of Helsinki. We will then explore the idea in more detail by considering, and responding to, a number of objections.
