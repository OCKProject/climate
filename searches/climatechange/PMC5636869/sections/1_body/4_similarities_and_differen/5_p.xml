<p id="Par38" class="p">First, we will argue that there is one complexity that we do 
 <italic class="italic">not</italic> need to be concerned about, because it is misguided. We do not need to worry about the difficulty of not being able to say that this engineer is responsible for 
 <italic class="italic">this particular</italic> set of emissions, or for 
 <italic class="italic">this particular</italic> harm. There is no reason why this difficulty should make it impossible for us to hold engineers 
 <italic class="italic">morally</italic> responsible for their actions. If we can provide a set of regulations which—if adhered to—would help to minimise the risk of harm, this is all we need. Once we have these regulations, we can criticise and punish those who refuse to comply. This is no different from any other regulations regarding—for example—pollution. There is no need to connect any particular harm to any particular act. The regulations are justified by the benefits that they can bring. Once the regulations have been put in place, the punishment that any particular engineer receives needn’t be understood as a punishment for any particular harm that they are 
 <italic class="italic">causally</italic> responsible for. It is perfectly justifiable if the punishment is simply punishment for an engineer’s 
 <italic class="italic">non</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">compliance</italic> with rules which—if adhered to—would help to combat climate change.
