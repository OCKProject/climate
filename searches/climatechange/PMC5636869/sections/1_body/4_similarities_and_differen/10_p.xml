<p id="Par43" class="p">Similarly, the law on negligence works in the same way. We cannot list every way in which a person could be negligent. In law, negligence requires “conduct that falls short of the standard expected of a person where a duty of care is owed”. (Cruz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2013</xref>, p. 233). To a large extent, this is vague. In the context of medical law, a defence against a charge of negligence would typically take the form of the individual arguing that his or her actions were consistent with what would be expected of a doctor. For example, it could involve evidence from other doctors stating that they would have acted in the same way. On the face of it, this looks like a problem in relation to our argument, relating to climate change. However, this is only a problem if we think that professional standards cannot change. A profession, for example, can come out and say that existing standards are not acceptable. Plausibly, this is the best way to understand the Declaration of Helsinki. This was an example of the medical profession making a point of stating explicitly that the standards of the time were not appropriate, and needed to be changed. Similarly, the engineering profession could come out and say that engineers are taking too many risks, or—in the context of climate change—engineers are not doing enough to protect future generations.
