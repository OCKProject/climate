 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par105" class="p">At the opening hearing [Douglas] Haughton [of Lockheed] challenged Senator Church by declaring that bribery was part of global business. It was the way things got done. He admitted that his firm had made foreign payments to politicians in the previous four and a half years of around $22 million. Republican Senator John Tower of Texas added that it was unfair that American companies stop making bribes if foreign rivals engage in such practices. (Vogl

  <p id="Par106" class="p">The arguments that were being made in the Church hearings by both leading Republicans and Democrats would be repeated over the next two decades in many countries as governments struggled to determine whether foreign bribe paying by their companies should be criminalized or whether bribes should just be accepted as part of the global way of doing business.

 </disp-quote>Similarly, in relation to the UK, he wrote:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par107" class="p">In the mid-1990s, former UK trade minister Lord Young told me in a radio discussion on corruption that British firms had to compete around the world to ensure that good jobs were maintained in the UK. To compete, he suggested, might mean doing what everyone else did and pay bribes. (Vogl
