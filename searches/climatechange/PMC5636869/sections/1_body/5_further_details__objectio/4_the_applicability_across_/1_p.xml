<p id="Par73" class="p">Following from the previous section, we also acknowledge that there may be another objection, even if we do recognise that climate change is an important issue and is relevant to 
 <italic class="italic">some</italic> engineers. The objection we have in mind could come in two ways. One would be look at the activities, professional responsibilities and fields of influence of engineers who are not working in the fossil fuel industry, or in other areas (such as aviation) that are notorious for their GHG emissions. Consider, for example, an audio engineer or biomedical engineer. The objection is that a declaration that covers all engineering domains will be too broad. It is just not plausible to think we need a declaration of climate action for audio engineers.
