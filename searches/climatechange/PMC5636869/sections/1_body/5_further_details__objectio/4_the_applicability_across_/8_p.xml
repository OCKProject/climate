<p id="Par83" class="p">Earlier we stated that “the majority of carbon emissions come from industries that are enabled by engineers and represented by the engineering professional institutions”. Even if it was only a small fraction of engineers who worked in these industries, this would not make a significant difference to our argument. If we want to regulate these activities, and if these activities are enabled by engineers, the engineering professional institutions have the potential to make a significant impact and to take on a role of leadership to combat climate change.</p>
