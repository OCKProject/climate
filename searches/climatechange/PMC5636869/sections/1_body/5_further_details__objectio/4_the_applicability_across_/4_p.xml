<p id="Par78" class="p">In relation to engineering, while it may be true that the impacts on climate change are 
 <italic class="italic">less</italic> significant for some engineers’ work than for others, it is not clear that this means that we should assume that a declaration of climate action would be irrelevant or of no great significance for audio engineers, for example. While there are clearly areas of engineering that have a greater impact on climate change than others, as highlighted by Heede, we should not lose sight of the fact that climate change is ultimately the result of the 
 <italic class="italic">accumulation</italic> of emissions from a range of different sources. While it is true that concerns about emissions may not be significant for all engineers, neither is it an issue that should be thought to be relevant only to a small fraction of engineers. The average emissions for a person, per year, differ according to where the individual lives. Mike Berners-Lee estimates that the “consumption footprint” (in tonnes of CO
