<p id="Par80" class="p">Much of this difference is likely to be due to the impact of particular consumables (such as meat, cars and flights), but it is far from clear that these are the only consumables that we need to care about. In “Delaying Obsolescence” Rob Lawlor focuses on the problems associated with everyday consumables like computers, phones and cameras, and—focusing on the issue of obsolescence (and of upgrading these consumables increasingly frequently)—he considers the ways in which different design decisions and different approaches to business and marketing can mitigate or exacerbate the problem (Lawlor

While he doesn’t list particular figures relating to the home entertainment systems that the audio engineer might work on, he does quote Giles Slade emphasising that in 2003 “63 million working PCs dumped into American landfills” and in 2004 this increased to “315 million”. (Slade

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e a 2010 21.5-inch iMac… Even before you turn it on, a new iMac has the same footprint as flying from Glasgow to Madrid and back”. (Berners-Lee
