<p id="Par63" class="p">The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report also reports on the likely impacts of climate change, stating:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par64" class="p">Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. (IPCC 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2014a</xref>, p. 8)
  </p>
 </disp-quote>Impacts highlighted by the report include the following:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par65" class="p">Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high confidence). Examples include greater likelihood of injury, disease, and death due to more intense heat waves and fires (very high confidence); increased likelihood of under-nutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions (high confidence); risks from lost work capacity and reduced labor productivity in vulnerable populations; and increased risks from food- and water-borne diseases (very high confidence) and vector-borne diseases (medium confidence). (IPCC 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>, pp. 19â€“20)
  </p>
 </disp-quote>In addition,
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par66" class="p">Throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confidence). Climate-change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries. (IPCC 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>, p. 20)
  </p>
 </disp-quote>And:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par67" class="p">Climate change over the 21st century is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). (IPCC 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>, p. 20)
  </p>
 </disp-quote>And:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par68" class="p">Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to these forms of conflict. (IPCC
