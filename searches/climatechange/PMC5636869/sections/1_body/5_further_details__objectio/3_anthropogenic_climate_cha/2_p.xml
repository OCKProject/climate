That is, we can put in data from earlier times in order to test how accurate their predictions are by comparing the results that are predicted by a model, based on the inputted data, with the actual results observed in the real world. In this way, models can be refined until they consistently make accurate predictions such that we then have good reason to trust their predictions for the future. With “very high confidence”, the summary of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (WGI AR5) states
