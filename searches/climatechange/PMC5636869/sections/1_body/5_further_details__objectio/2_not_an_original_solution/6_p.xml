<p id="Par57" class="p">In addition, we are also making a more significant statement in relation to the responsibility of engineers. Of course, many people talk about engineersâ€™ responsibilities, suggesting that engineers ought to think about the environment when making design choices. But what needs to be recognised here is that we are suggesting something 
 <italic class="italic">much</italic> more radical than this. We are asserting that climate change is fundamentally an issue for the engineering profession in the same way that we now recognise that research ethics is fundamentally an issue for the medical profession, such that the engineering profession 
 <italic class="italic">ought</italic> to play a 
 <italic class="italic">leading</italic> role in addressing problems relating to climate change. We are suggesting that it is plausible to think that the engineering profession could be the institution that could take the lead in achieving the large scale coordinated action that could be a significant advancement in the effort to reduce global emissions such that we can limit further climate change. As far as we know, no one else is suggesting anything as radical as this.
