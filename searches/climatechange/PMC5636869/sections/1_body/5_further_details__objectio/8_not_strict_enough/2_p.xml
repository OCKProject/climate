The historian, Simone Turchetti, commenting on the discussion following our presentation of this paper at the Royal Academy of Engineering, wrote:

There are plenty of other cases in history (1938, Royal Society on academic refugees from Nazi Germany; 1975 Asilomar conference on genetic engineering) when experts have agreed to mobilize and independently endorse ethical principles as a way to inform practices in the community and not necessarily with a view of ruling what other experts should be doing. If this is what the Academy wants to do in relation to climate change (i.e. set new ethical guidelines), I think the resonance of its decisions could be felt in the engineering community and the wider society.
