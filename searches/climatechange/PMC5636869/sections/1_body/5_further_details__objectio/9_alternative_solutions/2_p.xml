<p id="Par100" class="p">Here, it is important to stress that we are not claiming that our engineering-focused solution is the only solution available, or even the best solution available. Clearly, there is a lot that could be done at the political level. We simply claim that—so long as the political solutions are not forthcoming, or are not proving sufficient—there is something that the engineering profession can do to have a positive impact, and that it is something that the professional institutions ought to be doing, given the duties that the profession has, in relation to the public good and responsible leadership.</p>
