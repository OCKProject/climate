 <p class="p">We are grateful to the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for funding Rob Lawlor’s project “Climate Change, Ethics and Responsibility: an interdisciplinary approach” (early career research fellowship), which gave Rob the time to work on this paper (among others), and we are also grateful to the AHRC for Helen Morley’s project, “Ethics and the Globally Responsible Engineer” (Cultural Engagement Fund), which allowed Helen to organise events and meetings with Engineers Without Borders UK, allowing us both to discuss these ideas further. Of course, we are also grateful to the Royal Academy of Engineering (particularly Alan Walker and Andrew Chilvers) and to Engineers Without Borders UK (particularly Katie Cresswell-Maynard). Without the support of these institutions, and without their help in organising the events mentioned in this paper, we would not have been able to engage with the engineering profession, and with the concerns of engineers. Likewise, we are grateful to all who attended these events. Naturally, we are particular grateful to those participants whose ideas we discuss in this paper, but who we do not cite by name (because of the Chatham House rule). Similarly, we are grateful to the anonymous referees who gave us useful feedback on earlier drafts of this paper. And we are grateful to those who have commented on previous drafts of this paper on other occasions – such as the conference celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Inter-Disciplinary Ethics Applied centre in 2015. We are grateful to Josie Freear (the research assistant on the “Climate Change, Ethics and Responsibility: an interdisciplinary approach”) for useful discussions about the influence of the Declaration of Helsinki, and we are grateful to Andrew Stanners for helpful discussions about medical doctors and research. </p>
