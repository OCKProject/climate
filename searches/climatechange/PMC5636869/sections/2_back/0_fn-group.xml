  <p id="Par21" class="p">It is worth noting, that Stephanie Collins and Holly Lawford-Smith have argued that there can be a duty to 
   <italic class="italic">collectivise</italic>—that is, for individuals to work to form institutions in order to make collective action possible, if the necessary institutions don’t already exist. (Or, in some cases, if a collective already exists, there may be a duty to reform or re-organise an institution in order to be more effective.) (Collins

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2016</xref>; Lawford-Smith 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this context, it is worth emphasising the significance of the fact that the professional institutions have a head start here. The relevant institutions already exist – and already have a significant role in society. Our argument, in this paper, is that people in these institutions need to recognise the potential of their institutions and to work to get to the point where the professional institutions are able to make a significant contribution.

  <p id="Par30" class="p">Here, we acknowledge that Schinzinger and Martin also make a similar comparison, characterising engineering as social experimentation (Schinzinger and Martin 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2000</xref>). However, we would also emphasise the fact that their focus is somewhat different from ours. While both they and we compare engineering with medical research, we do so in different ways with a different focus. They focus on uncertainty, and the idea that engineers do things with the intention of benefitting people, without fully knowing what the consequences are going to be. They focus on the significance of (1) acting in partial ignorance, (2) making decisions in the face of uncertainty, and (3) the reliance on knowledge gained about products before and after they leave the factory. In contrast, the comparison that we highlight is based on the fact that, in both cases, there is a temptation to argue that the ends can justify the means. And this is largely what the Declaration of Helsinki was intended to challenge.

  <p id="Par72" class="p">Another reason for thinking that we do not need to worry too much about changing engineering practice, and ought not to make any significant effort to reduce our emissions, is that there might be a different approach to the problem of climate change: for example, geoengineering. We do not intend to address this possibility in detail here, and we do not even dismiss this possibility. We simply make one point: if geoengineering does prove to be the solution, then—at that point—the engineering profession can declare the Declaration on Climate Action to be unnecessary, and no longer in effect, and we can relax or abolish the various regulations. But if some suggest that we should just carry on using fossil fuels on the 
   <italic class="italic">assumption</italic> that geoengineering will provide the solution, we suggest that the burden is on them to prove that the 
   <italic class="italic">probability</italic> of this being a viable solution is high enough to be consistent with the engineering profession’s obligations to public health and safety, including future generations. The burden is not on us to prove that this is 
   <italic class="italic">not</italic> possible. For the moment, the IPCC states, “Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.” (IPCC
