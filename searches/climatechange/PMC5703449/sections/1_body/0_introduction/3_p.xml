<p class="p">The significant effect of individual lifestyles on both environmental change and health has drawn rapidly increasing attention in the research community recently [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For instance, augmented physical activity as a result of walking and cycling to destinations instead of driving will not only reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, but also lower the risk of chronic diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Previous studies have provided evidence of co-benefits in areas of active travel (walking and cycling) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], public transport [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], food-related behaviours (vegetarian lifestyle, organic and locally-sourced food, and plate waste) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], household energy use and waste management [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In the United States, five categories of household actions can provide a behavioural wedge to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: i) home weatherization and upgrades for heating and cooling equipment, ii) energy-efficient vehicles and appliances, iii) equipment maintenance, iv) equipment adjustment, and v) daily energy use behaviours (e.g. standby electricity and driving behaviour) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, co-benefits need to be adapted locally, as the benefits are largely contextual and affected by local practices, culture, lifestyle habits and so on. [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In addition, there is currently a dearth of evidence on the patterns and predictors of such co-benefit practices. More evidence is urgently needed to understand the associations between the practices of healthy behaviours and demographical factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], or between environmental friendly behaviours and demographic factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], particularly in a densely populated urban context. This study investigates the patterns of 10 different co-benefit behaviours relevant to an Asian urban community, and examines the relationship between demographics and the frequency of practicing co-benefit behaviours. The findings will provide valuable insight for tailoring behavioural interventions for different population subgroups.
