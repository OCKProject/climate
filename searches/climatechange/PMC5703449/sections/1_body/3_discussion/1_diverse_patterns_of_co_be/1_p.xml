<p class="p">As indicated in the findings, urban population in Asia showed a diverse pattern in the practice of health and environmental co-benefit behaviours in their daily life. Using less packaging and fewer disposable shopping bags received the highest frequency in daily practice (70.1%), reflecting success of the 2015 Plastic Shopping Bag Levy Scheme, a regulatory policy that requires a charge of HKD 0.5 (USD 0.06) for a plastic shopping bag [

The practices of having one vegetarian meal a week, bringing personal eating utensils when dining in restaurants or small eateries, and buying more organic food had a substantially lower proportion of daily practice than other behaviours in the same categories (4.0%-5.8%). Although the behaviours of consuming less meat and having one vegetarian meal a week bear similar incentives as well as health and environmental benefits, the proportions of daily practice among the population differed significantly (daily practice of Consume less meat (33.3%) vs. Have one vegetarian meal a week (5.8%), χ

This may be attributed to the perception and ease of the behaviour among the respondents, as it may be easier to reduce practicing a behaviour than it is to schedule or regulate a specific dietary change. A similar situation can be found for the behaviours of using less packaging and fewer disposable shopping bags and bringing personal eating utensils when dining in restaurants or small eateries, whereby reducing the practice of a current behaviour (albeit with considerable policy support) was found among a significantly higher proportion of people (70.1%) than instilling the practice of a non-normative behaviour (4.0%) (χ

Interestingly, in both cases, the patterns of socio-demographic associations were similar between the two behaviours despite differences in proportion of daily practice. In the case of buying organic food, the low proportion of daily practice (4.3%) can be attributed to a smaller share in the overall food market, complications around certification and labelling, and higher prices [
