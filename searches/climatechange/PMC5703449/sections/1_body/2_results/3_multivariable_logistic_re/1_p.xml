 <xref rid="pone.0188661.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. In general, females were more inclined to practice co-benefit behaviours, especially Use less packaging and fewer disposable shopping bags (AOR = 6.34, 95% CI: 2.75–14.60), Have one vegetarian meal a week (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.79–3.18), Buy more organic food (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.65–2.91), Consume less meat (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.60–2.87), Separate household waste (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.49–2.66), Use less electricity (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.19–2.14), Use less AC (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11–2.13), and Bring personal eating utensils when dining in restaurants or small eateries (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.05–2.23) (see
