 <xref rid="pone.0188661.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> includes the specific co-benefit behaviours, their linkages to health and environment, and their specific benefits in these areas. The 10 co-benefit behaviours were chosen to address both the practices supported by scientific evidence (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) as well as local community initiatives, such as showering less than five minutes every day [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Some co-benefit behaviours have been well-studied in high-income countries: travel behaviours [

 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], food-related behaviours [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], household energy use and waste management [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, in a densely populated Asian metropolis context like Hong Kong, the co-benefit behaviours need to be adjusted to the local context. For example, promoting the use of public transport is not as relevant in the territory because the rate of private car ownership in Hong Kong is low (0.07 car per person, compared with 0.46 in the United States and 0.41 in Japan) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0188661.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and a majority of the residents use public transportation daily. In a similar vein, all the co-benefit behaviours have been chosen in this study for their local relevance in revealing the pattern of behaviours with significant health and environmental impacts among Hong Kong residents.
