<p id="Par4" class="p">The second set of arguments is of more methodological nature. (1) our classical epidemiological tools, comparing exposed and control groups with respect to a risk factor are often not applicable, given the pervasiveness of climate change and the lack of control groups. (2) Climate change comprises different pathways, all of which have quite different health impacts: temperature, precipitation, ocean changes (pH, T, level) and air pollution.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> Moreover, gradual changes have different impacts from extreme events. (3) There is no such a thing as a new, or even typical “climate disease”. Rather, climate adds an incremental burden to some 80 already existing climate-sensitive diseases, from infectious to non-communicable diseases, undernutrition and injuries. The challenge is therefore to aggregate both mortality and morbidity impacts of a single disease under study, or ideally of all climate sensitive-diseases into a comprehensive, population-based metric for health outcomes, such as DALYs or QALYs. (4) The new risk factor “climate change” increases roughly exponentially over decades. Hence, no prospective observational study can be helpful in the time horizon that funders are willing to contemplate, i.e. 3–5 years. We have to learn from the past (see first argument). (5) Health impacts are likely to be influenced not only by a myriad of confounders and effect modifiers- social, economic, environmental and, of course, other risk factors for the disease under study- but also from adaptation efforts, both at the individual and societal levels. And finally (6), epidemiologists need to enter into deep cooperation with less familiar disciplines, probably more so than in any other fields of research: meteorology, climate science, agriculture, remote sensing and more.
