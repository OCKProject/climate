<p id="Par7" class="p">One is about human brainpower: We need to interest and “enroll” the sharpest scientific minds into this scientific challenge. Unfortunately, we do a bad job at teaching the topic in a systematic way at our universities, West, East, North and South: my last count was 5 accredited formal short courses of 1–3-weeks durations worldwide on “climate change and health”. Massive Open Online Courses (MMOCs) can quickly disseminate knowledge and convey skills. However, the current four MOOCS on the topic are introductory or policy-focused and do not provide research skills. This, however, is the focus of a new MOOC on “Research Methods for Studying Climate Change Health”. This course is currently being developed by scientists of various disciplines from 7 universities: Harvard, Heidelberg, Charité Medical School (Berlin), the London School of Hygiene, Nottingham, Paris Descartes/Sorbonne-Cité, and Umeå. Theses universities are joined by the INDEPTH-network.org, as well as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Impact Research (PIK). The course is targeted to doctoral students and postdocs from everywhere wishing to study the impact of climate change on a disorder. The course will provide access to the type of long-term data-sets in (sub-)tropical countries, which I described in the second para above. In addition, participants will learn the required (to be adapted) tools in quantitative health sciences as well as an understanding of key tools from other disciplines (e.g. on using climate models, weather data, agricultural data, remotely sensed data etc.).</p>
