<p class="p">Here, we applied a maximum-entropy (Maxent) approach for modeling the current distribution of common ragweed in the eastern U.S. We used common ragweed occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and climate data from WorldClim to build and evaluate our model and identified the most important climate predictors. We then applied a suite of 13 global climate models under two future greenhouse gas scenarios to project the potential future distribution for mid and late-century and identify areas that are most susceptible to future expansion.</p>
