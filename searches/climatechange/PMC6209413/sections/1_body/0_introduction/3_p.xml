<p class="p">The historical distribution of common ragweed has changed with variations in climate and land use. For instance, the paleoecological records indicate that common ragweed pollen abundance increased with hot, dry climates and frequent disturbances, such as fire, grazing, and to some extent, land clearing by humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In Europe, where common ragweed is an invasive non-native species, it has been increasing its distribution and is expected to further expand its range due to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Previous modeling efforts have used North American common ragweed distribution to calibrate their European models [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]; however, none have examined the potential expansion of common ragweed in North America. Moreover, we are not aware of any studies that have examined the driving climate and bioclimatic predictors of common ragweed across the heavily populated eastern U.S.
