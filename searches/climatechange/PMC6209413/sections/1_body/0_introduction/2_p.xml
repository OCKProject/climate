<p class="p">One plant species that may expand its range in the Northeast U.S. is common ragweed (
 <italic class="italic">Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> L., Asteraceae), a widely distributed annual weed whose pollen is the leading cause of hay fever and a major trigger of asthma [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Common ragweed has strong competitive growth on frequently disturbed soils [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and responds positively to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which can dramatically increase its growth, reproduction, and pollen output [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Once established, common ragweed forms dense monospecific stands and is well adapted to a diversity of habitats. However, ragweed generally requires full or abundant sun for germination [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and therefore usually does not grow under full tree canopy. Consequently, it is usually found in non-forested habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and agricultural croplands.
