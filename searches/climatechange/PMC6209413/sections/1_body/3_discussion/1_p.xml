<p class="p">Our results show that common ragweed is projected to have substantially more suitable climate space in the future across the eastern U.S. However, the vast majority of this increase is projected to occur by mid-century and may be moderated somewhat by the 2070s. This finding implies that common ragweed may be sensitive to climatic variability. For instance, we found that ragweed is positively correlated with increasing August precipitation, which was not surprising. However, ragweed was also negatively correlated to very low or very high annual precipitation variability, indicating a general sensitivity to precipitation extremes. Ragweedâ€™s sensitivity to water stress has been identified by others [
