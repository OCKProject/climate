<p class="p">Another factor that influences the growth and potentially the establishment of ragweed is the greenhouse gas CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Specifically, common ragweed has been shown to respond positively to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], and global CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are increasing [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Although we did not include CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in our model, future research could also integrate this factor into future projections of ragweed growth and distribution. There are many facets of modeling ragweed that could be explored. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that a relatively simple climate niche model can predict its current distribution. Although not intended for fine-scale mapping of ragweed occurrence, our model can be used to highlight key climatic drivers and inform management actions.
