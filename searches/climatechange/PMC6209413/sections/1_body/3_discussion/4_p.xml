<p class="p">Land use and disturbance history are also important, known drivers of ragweed distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. We did not include land use in our final model because regional projections of future land use change were not available. However, we did explore the relative influence of land use in determining ragweed’s current distribution with earlier exploratory models. Specifically, we included three land cover variables–National Land Cover data, tree canopy cover data, and a dataset of impervious surfaces [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]–along with our climate variables to predict ragweed occurrence. The dataset of impervious surfaces was an important predictor variable in early exploratory model runs. Therefore, future research will further examine the role of land use and how projected future changes in both land use and climate change may impact ragweed occurrence. We also recognize that there is geographic and ecotypic variation among ragweed populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], but to our knowledge incorporating this variation into predictive models for the U.S. has not been done.
