<p class="p">We modeled ragweed distribution using climate predictor variables only. Alternative modeling approaches could also include other factors, such as dispersal, land-use change, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, and geographic and ecotypic variation among ragweed populations. Others have also developed mechanistic modeling approaches to predict ragweed distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. We agree. Integrating mechanistic and empirical modeling approaches may improve the predictive power and certainty associated with future projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Predictive models could also be parameterized and restrained with known dispersal abilities, as has been done with common ragweed in Europe [
