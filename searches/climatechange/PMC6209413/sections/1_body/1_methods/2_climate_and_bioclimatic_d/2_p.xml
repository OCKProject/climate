 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. We included bioclimatic variables because they represent meaningful controls of plant growth and distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We built and analyzed a number of ragweed distribution models to identify the most important predictor variables. We then examined correlations between those variables and selected four uncorrelated climate and bioclimatic variables, including precipitation seasonality, mean diurnal temperature range, August precipitation, and January maximum temperature. Precipitation seasonality is a measure of the variation in monthly precipitation totals over the course of the year [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Mean diurnal temperature range is the mean of the monthly temperature ranges (i.e., monthly maximum minus monthly minimum) [
