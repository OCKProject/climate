<p class="p">The future climate data was downscaled from 13 individual global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that were used in the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We used downscaled future climate data from these 13 GCMs for two time periods: 2050s (averaged across 2041–2060) and 2070s (averaged across 2061–2080) and under two scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. These greenhouse gas emissions scenarios apply socio-economic assumptions about future changes in global population, technological advances, and other factors that influence the amount of CO

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. We used RCP 4.5 because it represents a low emissions scenario in which emissions stabilize by mid-century and decline thereafter, and RCP 8.5, which represents a high emissions scenario and assumes continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions until the end of the 21st century [
