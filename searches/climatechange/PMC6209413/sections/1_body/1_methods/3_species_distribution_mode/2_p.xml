<p class="p">We built our Maxent model using ragweed occurrence data and climate and bioclimatic variables to predict probability distributions across 3.3 million grid cells. We split our data set into two sets–a randomly selected 70% of the data for model training and 30% for model evaluation. To test the predictive performance of our model we resampled the test data set 500 times and report the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] and the fraction of our study area that our model predicted present [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. To model the future distribution of ragweed we used downscaled climate projections from thirteen individual GCMs for the 2050s and 2070s and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios–RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5.
