<p class="p">We built a species distribution model for common ragweed using Maxent software [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In general, species distribution models identify a relationship between a species’ presence and a number of environmental or climate variables observed at those locations [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Once built, species’ distribution models then can be used to predict the suitability of a grid cell. This suitability is a function of the previously identified relationship for that given species and the environmental variables. Suitability then can be modeled for other locations or under different conditions (i.e., future climates). The Maxent software uses a machine-learning technique called maximum entropy modeling, which finds the distribution that best represents the data given all the available information [

 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Maxent is one of the better performing predictive modeling techniques and has been widely used for modeling species’ distributions [
