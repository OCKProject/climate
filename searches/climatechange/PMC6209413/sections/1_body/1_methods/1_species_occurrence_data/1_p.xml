 <italic class="italic">Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> (common ragweed) from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) online database (gbif.org). This dataset included over 3000 records of occurrence from 76 published datasets in the United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. We then clipped the occurrence dataset with a shapefile of the eastern U.S. bounded by the Mississippi River on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205677.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). We also removed occurrences that were outside of the contiguous U.S. resulting in 726 common ragweed occurrence records.
