<p class="p">We built the most parsimonious model possible while still maintaining a relatively high AUC score and predicting 85% of ragweed’s presences. We used four uncorrelated variables, including precipitation seasonality, mean diurnal temperature range, August precipitation, and January maximum temperature. Of these four variables, mean maximum temperature in January contributed the most to ragweed predictions, followed by precipitation seasonality, mean diurnal temperature range, and August precipitation. The response curve of how mean maximum temperature during January affects the predicted probability of ragweed occurrence (

The relationship between predicted ragweed occurrence and precipitation seasonality was more complex–ragweed had a negative relationship in response to very low and very high precipitation seasonality and a positive relationship with moderate precipitation seasonality (
