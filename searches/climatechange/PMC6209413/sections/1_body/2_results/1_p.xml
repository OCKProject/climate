<p class="p">Our species distribution model was able to accurately predict 85% of ragweed’s presences across the study area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205677.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, left panel). Analyzing the reserved test data set, our model had an AUC score of 0.765, and the omission rate–that is predicting no presence when one is there–was 0.396 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205677.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The occurrence data that we used did not include true absence information for common ragweed. Therefore, we calculated the fraction of the total study area that our model predicted present and compared this to a random prediction of presences with an AUC of 0.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This technique uses pseudo-absences instead of true absences to calculate the percent of correctly predicted absences [
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The fraction of the study area that our model predicted present was 0.154.
