<p class="p">The area of suitable climate space for common ragweed is projected to increase in the future but varies by greenhouse gas scenario and time period (
 <xref rid="pone.0205677.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, the area projected to be suitable for ragweed was greatest during the 2050s as compared to the 2070s under both greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The higher scenario–RCP 8.5 –had larger increases of suitable area for ragweed compared to RCP 4.5 for the 2050s, but less of an increase for the 2070s compared to RCP 4.5. Because ragweed occurrence varies considerably by GCM, we used an ensemble to summarize all 13 models for each greenhouse gas scenario and time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205677.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). All future projections of suitable area for ragweed show substantial contraction in central Florida, southern Appalachian Mountains, and northeastern Virginia. Areas of potential ragweed expansion occur in the northern states with CGM model agreement highest in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. All future projections also agree that Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the coastal areas of New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, and North Carolina will remain suitable for ragweed during the current century.
