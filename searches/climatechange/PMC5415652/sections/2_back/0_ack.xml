 <p class="p">This paper has benefited from the thoughtful response of discussant Tim Kasser and other participants in the Material Demand Reduction workshop held at St Catherine's College, Cambridge, in September 2016, organized by Julian Allwood, Sandy Skelton, Andre Cabrera Serrenho and colleagues. I am also grateful to colleagues on the Earth in Vision project, Kim Hammond and George Revill, and also to independent researcher Teresa Ashe, and to Stories of Change collaborator Renata Tyszczuk for additional comments and advice. Interviews conducted in support of the International Broadcasting Trust's work on climate change and television, sponsored by the JJ Charitable Trust also informed the paper. Those interviews were undertaken by the author or consultant Helen Magee, and the project managed by IBT Director Mark Galloway. The recorded Earth in Vision project interviews that contributed to this study were conducted for the project by a combination of the author, Kim Hammond and Jeremy Bristow. They were filmed and edited by the environment and natural history producer Jeremy Bristow and cameraman and editor John McIntyre. Regular discussions with the BBC's Bill Thompson, Chair of the Earth in Vision project Advisory Board have also informed the work. The paper was informed by archival work at the BBC Written Archives Centre at Caversham, and thanks are due to the helpful staff there, above all Trish Hayes.</p>
