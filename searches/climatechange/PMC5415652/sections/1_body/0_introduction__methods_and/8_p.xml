<p class="p">The paper benefits from a body of often multi-disciplinary research that has sought to expand understanding of the varied mediations of climate change knowledge, whether through media, campaigning or the arts, including, prominently, a series of monographs by Boykoff [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], Doyle [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and Hansen [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This research has also been informed by Hulme's extended consideration of the cultural politics of knowledge surrounding climate change [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and more collective explorations of this cultural politics [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However with the exception of Doyle [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], this enterprising literature has paid relatively little attention to non-news television, and her treatment does not directly address material demand reduction. The literature on media and climate change has generated pointed critiques of both media, and research and policy community practices, but non-news television remains relatively little covered, and, within that, discussion of processes of media decision-making even less so. This paper seeks to address these gaps by bringing together a specific, significant and under-acknowledged dimension of the climate mitigation challenge, that is, material demand reduction, with analysis of relevant programmes and their production.
