<p class="p">But above all television needs good stories. Definitions of a ‘good story’ vary but television executives have three proxies: strong ratings, positive critical reaction and a less tangible sense of whether or not a programme has been ‘talked about’ (whether within the industry or more widely in society). For anyone in the policy or research communities concerned with material demand reduction a good story will also need to support macro or micro changes to systems and/or everyday lives.</p>
