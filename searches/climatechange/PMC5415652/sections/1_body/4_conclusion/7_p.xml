<p class="p">Researchers can apply forensic rigour to the question as to whether a steel supply and specification system or a coffee cup has ‘quality’ in terms of its contribution to our individual and collective futures. This will help to embed potentially engaging stories within more or less everything that people look at, touch and use. Thus, the stuff society lives with might gather an association with having an inner beauty or inherent ugliness. In this way, researchers can play a strategic role in shaping the extent to which a product or service tells a ‘good-quality’ story. In so doing they will equip television producers with the raw materials for scripts and filmed sequences that can quietly but purposefully revise notions of a ‘good life’.</p>
