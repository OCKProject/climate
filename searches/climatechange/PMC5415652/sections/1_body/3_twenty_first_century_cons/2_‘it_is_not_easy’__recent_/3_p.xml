<p class="p">The long-running (since 1999) Channel 4 home-building series 
 <italic class="italic">Grand Designs</italic> was also offered by several media decision-makers as an example of sustainability thinking, again set within the idiom of aspirational lifestyle television. However, this aspirational specialist factual programme carries more content about consuming ‘well’ than less. Perhaps in acknowledgement of this, the on-screen talent Kevin McCloud has also presented series and one-off shows devised around or linked to material demand reduction, including 
 <italic class="italic">Kevin McCloud's Man Made Home</italic> (Channel 4, 2012 and 2013) and 
 <italic class="italic">Kevin's Supersized Salvage</italic> (Channel 4, 2014) that several interviewees offered as examples of taking sustainability into the heart of mainstream television schedules.
