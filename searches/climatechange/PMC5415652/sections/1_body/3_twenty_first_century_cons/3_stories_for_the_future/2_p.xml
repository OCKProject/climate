<p class="p">Some of the most pressing jeopardies facing humanity are at first glance unattractive topics for media decision-makers both because they view them as ‘difficult’ stories to tell, and they believe audiences will not come to watch them. While this is true of climate change and biodiversity loss in general the arguments put for significant material demand reduction by Allwood 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] are at first sight even more difficult propositions. On top of all of the challenges that come with the distinctive cultural politics of climate change, arguments for substantial material demand reduction bring additional quandries. They are rooted in fine grained and shifting technical knowledge about the which, how, where and when of material demand reduction (see, for example, [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] or [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160375C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] for reviews that reflect this complexity). A deeper buried, but perhaps more significant obstacle is that the goal appears to question some deeply entrenched assumptions about interrelations between the economy and social and cultural stability. The unwritten social contract of late capitalism assumes ever-expanding and/or sustained high levels of material consumption as a route to fulfilment and self-expression. This has proved a very robust frame, and despite very varied efforts across several decades has been not been supplanted by competing frames rooted in arguments about environmental costs of, or limits to, human development.
