<p class="p">The same themes of self-sufficiency, simple living and alternative community were also explored in episodes of 
 <italic class="italic">By Way of Change</italic>, a documentary series which explored radical living experiments, including 
 <italic class="italic">The Shrub Family</italic> (episode 6). The Shrub Family intentional community, or commune, sought to reduce their impact on the natural world through sharing accommodation and other goods. In one filmed sequence, one couple share a bath while two other members of the community chat with them, one perches near the bath reading aloud a letter to the community from a shared friend. The film-makers tone and gently paced approach is sympathetic. The channel controller could be confident that the to-most bizarre spectacle of shared baths, houses and jobs would draw a decent audience.
