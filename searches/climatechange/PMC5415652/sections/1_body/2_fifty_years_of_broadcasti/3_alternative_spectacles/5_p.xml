<p class="p">In an early example of what has come to be known as reality television a 1975 film in 
 <italic class="italic">The World About Us</italic> documentary strand 
 <italic class="italic">Back to Nature</italic> followed a group of volunteers as they lived off the land in a remote part of Exmoor, southwest England, for a fortnight with just one set of clothes each, knives, string and one bag of oats. These first examples of the reality TV genre on British television are organized around the idea of giving up material goods and modern living. Explicit reference to simplicity and a rejection of material consumption within settings that are clearly exceptional provides programme makers with interesting and watchable forms of difference, both in terms of what's said and what is seen. Challenge elements serve to generate peaks of jeopardy for many of these otherwise slow-paced films. In the closing lines of 
 <italic class="italic">Back to Nature</italic>, the voiceover, as they walk off the moor at the end of their fortnight states that ‘we had proved something to ourselves, if only that there are many things in life that we can do without. At the same time we are filled with an unholy joy at the prospect ahead of us of the lonely cafe…’
