<p class="p">A more mainstream treatment of energy and resource demand management is offered in a BBC1 documentary series 
 <italic class="italic">What on Earth… are we doing?</italic> The episode 
 <italic class="italic">Power to the People</italic> presented by broadcaster and naturalist David Bellamy is unusual in consistently drawing critical attention to the extravagant energy demands of modern life, while acknowledging its pleasures. Within the title sequence, the Earth is viewed from space, and a voiceover notes ‘Man launches himself into space and for the first time in history can see himself and his world’. The programme's theme and tone however is down to earth: the opening scene tours the English seaside resort of Blackpool's extravagant illuminations. It moves into a collage of: the town's famous light display; one arm bandit gambling machine and newspaper headlines, settling on the words ‘Fuel Crisis Crunch’.
