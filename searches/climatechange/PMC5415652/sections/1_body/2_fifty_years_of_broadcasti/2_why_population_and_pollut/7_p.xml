<p class="p">In one episode of a 1967 BBC2 series on 
 <italic class="italic">The Population Problem</italic>, a Prof. Fremlin predicts in a studio discussion that ‘in the future we'll all be living underground eating minute floating plants’. The expert suggests that on account of population growth we will in future all have to live underground, or in underwater cities, so that all productive land and water can be put to work using sunlight to produce food. ‘Is there an even more drastic stage?’ asks the deadpan presenter Derek Cooper. ‘Yes’ replies Prof. J. H. Fremlin, with a twinkle in his eye. ‘If we begin to synthesise our food chemically… Using as our raw materials mainly human excreta with a little bit of addition of assorted minerals. I don't think we'd need to feed the bodies back in. I think we could do without that. Then one could go on producing as much food as we needed for as far as one can see’.
