<p class="p">In correspondence during the consideration of Frank Fraser Darling, the Editor of Science Talks invites him to lunch to discuss potential programming given the fact that ‘We have noticed that 1970 is European Conservation year, etc., etc., and of course, there was the OECD inter-governmental conference in Paris in September. This has set us thinking afresh and we are interested not just in conservation with a little or even a big C, but the future of the biosphere and man in it’ (Correspondence: Archie Clow to Frank Fraser Darling, 20 February 1969). In the wake of the lunch Fraser Darling outlines the route his Reith lectures could take, arguing that ‘we desperately need to tackle human problems ecologically — the term now is the “ecosystem approach”! Further I have a beautiful lot of stuff on lop-sided development and the consequences’ (23 March 1969 Correspondence, FFD to Dr Archie Clow). His pitch asked: ‘How do we arrive at a modus vivendi which will not render civilization a contradiction in terms ecologically?’ (Frank Fraser Darling proposal presented to Archie Clow 23 March 1969 BBC).</p>
