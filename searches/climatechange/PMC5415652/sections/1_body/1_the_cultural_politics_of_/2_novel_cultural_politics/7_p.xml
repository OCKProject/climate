<p class="p">For all these reasons to do with the systemic and complex nature of materials demand, it is difficult to shape a cohesive story that can be told within a few minutes to a peak time mid-evening audience on a popular channel. This suggests that while both policy design and media storytelling need to be informed (even if implicitly) by a more systematic approach the ‘whole system story’ will remain difficult to tell. But perhaps the most significant element of the discussion of systemic transformation required by material demand reduction is the assumption that it will require a transformation of the political economy of energy and resources. An essential step in Allwood 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.'s argument is that ‘the feedbacks of global warming have a relatively long time delay - and a key challenge in implementing material efficiency is to find economic justification today for actions that will benefit the population in future’ [

Together these varied factors make for a rich and complex picture.
