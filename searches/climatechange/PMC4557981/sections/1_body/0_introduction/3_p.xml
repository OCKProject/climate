<p class="p">Hydrologic changes and potential shifts in the distribution of wetlands across montane landscapes could have substantial consequences for wetland species, ecosystems, and their extended biological networks. Because many wetland species sort along coarse hydrologic gradients, such as duration of inundation or wetland permanence, as a function of life history and developmental requirements [

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], their vulnerability to climate-induced habitat loss will not be distributed evenly [

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore understanding climate impacts on different hydrologic classes of wetlands is critical to assessing vulnerability of particular species or types of wetland ecosystems, and more generally to understanding how the wide range of ecological services wetlands provide is likely to change over time.
