<p class="p">The shortage of empirical data on wetland dynamics, coupled with the inherent complexities of studying wetlands (e.g. sheer number of sites, diverse range of wetland types, highly dynamic hydrologic responses, etc.), has allowed an untested assumption to persist, i.e. that wetlands are simply too complex to model with the limited site specific information and data that are available. The challenges are real: existing methods for wetland hydrologic modeling largely focus on individual sites and require a detailed understanding of fine-scale surface and subsurface hydrologic processes (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]). The data necessary for these models are almost universally lacking for wetlands in general and for small wetlands in particular, which are largely defined by the microtopography of their surroundings and connections to groundwater and small streams. Where data and models are available, a key limitation of such fine-scale approaches is that they generally cannot be applied to answer questions of how wetland dynamics will respond to climate change at the landscape scale. The limited approaches that do exist for predicting landscape-level response require longer time series of hydrometeorological data than are generally available (e.g. WETLANDSCAPE models) [
