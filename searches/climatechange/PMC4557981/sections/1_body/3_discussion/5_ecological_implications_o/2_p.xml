<p class="p">For wetland-reliant species like amphibians and invertebrates that require minimum durations of water availability to breed and complete aquatic life stages, the projected changes in wetland hydrologic response are likely to reduce the number of sites available for breeding, may affect larval densities, individual correlates of fitness such as size at metamorphosis, and reduce recruitment success [

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. While many species will be affected by changes in both the timing and frequency of drying, those that metamorphose within a single summer may be more sensitive to changes in the timing of wetland drying. In contrast, species that require multiple years to complete larval development are likely to be most sensitive to changes in the frequency of drying [
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In wetlands not at risk of drying entirely, ecological effects may also depend on how thermal conditions in ponds change as the climate warms and water levels drop [

This may affect important drivers of population and community dynamics such as population connectivity, synchrony, and rates of recolonization [
