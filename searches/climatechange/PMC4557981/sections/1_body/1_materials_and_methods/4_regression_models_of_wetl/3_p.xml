<p class="p">For most Mount Rainier, Olympic, and North Cascades sites, we had only a single year of data from which to fit the regression models. However, when multiple-years of observations were available (e.g. for some sites in Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park and for all sites in Oregon and California), we investigated the uncertainty in the projections when fitting to a single year of data. For Oregon and California sites that showed similar gradual drawdown patterns for observed years, we fitted a separate regression model for each individual year of multiple years of observations, developed simulations for all years using each of these models, and then calculated the squared correlation coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) using all observations and the corresponding simulations for each model. We then used the single-year regression model showing the highest squared correlation coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for all the available data to simulate historical wetland response and the associated climate-change response. We used the regression models fitted to other years to estimate the uncertainty in the simulations due to uncertainty in the regression parameters for individual years. For the Willamette National Forest site, for example, the squared correlation coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for the three regression models using 2003, 2005 and 2006 data to train the regression models, was 0.49, 0.88 and 0.75, respectively. Therefore, we used the regression model fitted on the 2005 observed data to simulate the historical response and used the regression models for years 2003 and 2006 to estimate the uncertainty of the simulation due to uncertainty in the regression fit.
