<p class="p">Quantitatively we define the four wetland types based on average minimum water levels. Generally shallow 
 <bold class="bold">ephemeral wetlands</bold> dry completely or drop, on average, below 3% of their maximum water levels. Ephemeral wetlands are functionally dry for most aquatic species in most years, but may have water for the entire summer in unusually wet periods. 
 <bold class="bold">Intermediate wetlands</bold> drop to between 3% and 33% of their maximum water levels on average and may dry completely in some years. 
 <bold class="bold">Perennial wetlands</bold> drop to a mean of 33% to 70% of their maximum water levels and only in extreme droughts do they dry completely. For 
 <bold class="bold">permanent wetlands</bold> (lakes and large ponds), the average minimum water levels generally remain greater than 70% of their maximum water levels and are never dry in the historical record. These four types represent general hydrologic classes of wetlands that can be related to more detailed hydrogeomorphic wetland-classification systems such as those used in U.S. Natural Heritage programs and for conservation decision making [
