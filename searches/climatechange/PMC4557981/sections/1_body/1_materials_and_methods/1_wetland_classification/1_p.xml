<p class="p">We define wetlands broadly as any area where shallow surface water collects. Wetlands exist on a hydrologic continuum and many different methods of wetland classification exist (e.g. Cowardin, hydrogeomorphic (HGM)). We use a simple hydrologic classification scheme based on hydroperiod and wetland sensitivity to climate variability to characterize four ecologically relevant types of wetlands–ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, and permanent (

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] in that it relates inherently continuous hydrologic variation in water permanence and periodicity to more discrete ecological thresholds determined by species’ development and life history requirements (e.g. number of months or years that ponds must hold water for an insect, frog, or salamander to develop and metamorphose).
