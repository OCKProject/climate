Exceptions to the overall good model performance were the minimum water level for the year 2006 for Deschutes National Forest, Oregon (

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>). For the Deschutes National Forest, the observed minimum water level for year 2006 was 13% of full capacity but the simulation minimum was 22â€“34%. For the Trinity Alps Wilderness site, the wetland started drawdown about one month later in 2003 compared to the other years but the simulation was not able to reproduce this timing.
