<p class="p">For sites where multiple years of data existed, we found considerable uncertainty and variation in model performance (Figs

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). For example, different regression models for the Trinity Alps (CA) site, constructed using different years of data, showed an average difference of 47 days between the earliest and latest prediction of minimum water levels in summer (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>). While the regression model for Mount Rainier National Park developed based on 1992 data (0.83 &lt; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &lt; 0.99; 1.60 &lt; RMSE &lt; 8.91) also captured the observed drawdown at the same wetlands in 2012 (1.77 &lt; RMSE &lt; 15.63) (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), model performance across different years was poor for Olympic National Park. For Olympic National Park, the regression model based on 2000 observations (0.51 &lt; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &lt; 0.81; 4.28 &lt; RMSE &lt; 19.67) missed the timing of drawdown and/or minimum water levels observed in 2012 (17.57 &lt; RMSE &lt; 49.12) (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). We therefore might expect comparable levels of uncertainty in the performance of the single-year regression fits for the broader suite of wetlands at Mount Rainier, Olympic and North Cascades National Parks. These issues related to the performance of single-year regression fits once again highlight the need for improved monitoring of wetlands over multiple years.
