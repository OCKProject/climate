<p class="p">These climate-induced shifts in hydrologic behavior across all types of montane wetlands in our study for which we had site specific models support the hypothesis that climate change will force transitions among wetland types (

By the 2080s, 58% of intermediate wetlands are projected to become ephemeral hydroperiod wetlands (17/31 sites), whereas 22% of perennial wetlands are projected to become intermediate wetlands (7/32 sites) and 3% to become ephemeral wetlands (1/32 sites) (
