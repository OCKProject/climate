<p class="p">Considered at the landscape scale, the projected effects of climate change on future probabilities of drying of intermediate wetlands in mountainous areas of Washington vary geographically but increase overall in higher elevation regions (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>). Lowland areas are typically below the soil moisture threshold every year, and the probability of drying (by this measure) does not change in these areas, thus our model is not appropriate for assessment of lower elevation regions (grey areas on the maps). Similarly, many mid-low elevation regions show little change or even a small shift towards becoming wetter (light green and purple regions on 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 10C</xref>). At higher elevations, both along the crest of the Washington Cascades and in the Olympic Mountains, the probability of drying for intermediate wetlands changes substantially. Under the 20
