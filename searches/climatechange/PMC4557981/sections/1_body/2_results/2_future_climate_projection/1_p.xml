<p class="p">We found consistent projected effects of climate change on all classes of wetlands, including earlier drawdown, a more rapid recession rate in summer, and reduced minimum water levels (Figs

 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>). Overall, water levels in ephemeral or intermediate wetlands are most sensitive to climate change (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 8A, 8B, 8E and 8F</xref>). In ephemeral or intermediate wetlands, the effects of earlier drawdown, more rapid summer recession rate, and reduced minimum water levels result in a longer dry season in summer (Figs 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8A, 8B, 8E and 8F</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6C</xref>). Results for perennial and permanent wetlands also showed earlier drawdown and/or reduced water levels in future climates (Figs 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.g008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8C, 8D, 8G and 8H</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6A and S6B</xref>). Our projections also revealed variations in the magnitude of changes that were dependent on wetland type and location.
