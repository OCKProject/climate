<p class="p">Data from natural history collections, repeated surveys, and other monitoring activities continue to be used to study biotic responses to 20th century climate change [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Although these studies have increased our knowledge of how species can vary their phenologies, distributions, abundances, and phenotypes in response to climate change, linking these observations to long-term effects on species’ persistence, community structure, and ecosystem function has proven difficult [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. This is partly because resurvey and monitoring studies inevitably focus on near-term outcomes, meaning that they are typically unable to consider species responses to large shifts in climate—those similar in magnitude to those predicted for the 21st century and beyond [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Another problem is the lack of field-based experimental approaches (e.g., translocation experiments) in climate ecological research, which can directly attribute ecological mechanisms to biotic responses to different climatic conditions using cause-effect relationships [
