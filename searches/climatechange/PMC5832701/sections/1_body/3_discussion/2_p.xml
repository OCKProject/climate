<p class="p">By combining physiological and biological flight models with predicted range changes from species distribution models, we have demonstrated that European long-distance migrant birds are likely to have to spend more time on their migratory journeys in future. Such journeys are predicted to require additional refuelling stopovers, adding to the overall duration of migration. Here, we discuss our findings in relation to the potential impacts of increased migration distances and durations on species, as well as the wider implications of additional stopovers and changes to migratory journeys.</p>
