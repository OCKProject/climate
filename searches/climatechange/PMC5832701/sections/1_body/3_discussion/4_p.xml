<p class="p">In addition to the direct costs of migration, altered migration patterns can also have carry-over effects, affecting reproductive success [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Recent climate change has led to advancements in the phenology of many speciesâ€™ life-history events. Longer migrations (in distance and duration) could exacerbate the widely reported effects of phenological mismatch of migrants returning to the breeding grounds [

 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Long-distance migrants are particularly susceptible to the effects of this phenological mismatch, with those that have shown the least adjustment in their spring arrival times demonstrating the greatest population declines [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. For example, despite pied flycatchers (
 <italic class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca)</italic> advancing egg laying dates by 10 days, this can be insufficient to track spring phenological changes, with a consequent 90% decline in some populations [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. We predict that, by 2070, this species will take an additional 4 days to travel between the non-breeding and breeding ranges, potentially exacerbating current mismatch. Delays to the arrival of long-distance migrants onto their breeding ranges could further reduce their competitive ability and access to resources, with negative consequences for reproductive success.
