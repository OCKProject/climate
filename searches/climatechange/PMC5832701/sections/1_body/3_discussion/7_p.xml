<p class="p">Migration is a naturally plastic trait. Observed changes in migratory behaviour include short-stopping [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and changes in overwintering locations [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. For passerines, however, these observations are mostly restricted to short-distance migrants, which already demonstrate a wide range of migratory movements [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Long-distance migrants, which tend to have a smaller diversity of migratory movements, may have lower adaptive capacity, rendering them less resilient to environmental change than resident and short-distance migrants [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Our models do not currently account for plasticity, but if we are to better understand how migratory species may respond to environmental change, this could be a key area for development.
