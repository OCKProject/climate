<p class="p">Detailed knowledge of the habitats and destinations used by birds migrating beyond Europe during the non-breeding season is currently limited, especially in terms of linking specific breeding populations to non-breeding localities. Recent geolocation tracking studies have enhanced our understanding of non-breeding distributions, population-specific migratory pathways and the wide variety of migratory movements demonstrated within some species [

 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Currently, such data are only available for a few individuals in a small subset of species. Our simulations of migrations, based on the shortest distance between breeding and non-breeding areas, are simplistic, with the routes made by individual migrants in the real world often being more complex. However, by considering intra-specific variation, our models allow for a better understanding of the full range of possible migration routes used by species and the possible impacts of future climate change.
