<p class="p">Our results indicate that, in future, as many as 37% of journeys made by Afro-Palaearctic migratory species will require an additional refuelling stopover. Conditions at stopover locations can impact not only the migratory performance of birds but also their subsequent reproductive success, by influencing both their timing of arrival and the physical condition in which they arrive at breeding areas [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. An increased reliance on stopovers might render migratory species more vulnerable to changes in habitat in relatively small and briefly used areas [
