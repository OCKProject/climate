<p class="p">These findings shed new light on the likely impacts of climate change on the distance, duration and stopover requirements of long-distance avian migration. They show that, in future, the distances that long-distance migrants will need to travel between suitable breeding and non-breeding habitats will significantly increase. Importantly, by additionally considering the required increase in the number of refuelling stopovers, as well as species-specific flight capabilities, we demonstrate how the overall duration of their journeys is likely to change. We conclude that, in addition to the widely recognized threats of climate and habitat change on species' breeding and non-breeding ranges, migrants will also be exposed to additional pressures from changing migratory journeys, potentially exacerbating anticipated population declines. Our findings add weight to the argument that current climate change impact assessments overlook the complex interplay of spatial and temporal constraints on migratory species, and underestimate their vulnerability to future environmental change. Furthermore, our analyses offer a useful toolkit for more realistic evaluations of the risks faced by the large number of mobile species for which individual tracking data are currently unavailable. Integrating these metrics into future climate change impact assessments could enable more informed conservation actions for migratory species.</p>
