<p class="p">Globally, populations of many migratory species are declining at rates far exceeding those of their resident counterparts [

 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Identifying the cause of these declines is complicated by the dependence of migrant species on multiple locations, including on their breeding and non-breeding grounds, as well as on the stopover sites used during migration [

 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] are often cited as the primary drivers of population declines. With long-distance migrants spending a significant proportion of their annual cycle on migration [
