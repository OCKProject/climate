<p class="p">Here, we examine the potential effect of climate change on the migration distances of 77 species of common European-breeding birds, based on projections of their current and potential future breeding and non-breeding ranges. We use physiological and morphological traits to estimate the species' flight potential (flight range) before individuals would need to stop to refuel. Based on this, we estimate the number of stopovers that individuals of each species require, on average, to travel between their breeding and non-breeding grounds under current and future projected conditions. Combining total flight and refuelling times allows us to estimate the total duration of migratory journeys. Using data from published geolocator studies, we validate our estimates of the time currently taken for individuals of a subset of species to migrate between their non-breeding and breeding grounds. Finally, we use our analyses to identify which bird species are projected to experience the greatest future changes to their migratory journeys.</p>
