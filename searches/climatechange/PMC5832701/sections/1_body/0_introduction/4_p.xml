<p class="p">Typically, migratory distance is calculated as the great-circle distance between breeding and non-breeding range centroids [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, this simple calculation obscures the complex variety of between- and within-species migratory movements [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Migratory connectivity—the extent to which breeding and non-breeding populations of a species remain connected—varies significantly among species [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The degree to which birds use the same migration route can fluctuate not only among individuals within a population but also between years for individuals [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and between spring and autumn for the same individual [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. If the potential impacts of climate change on migration are to be identified, it is important that this potential variation within species in migration distances is considered.
