However, as these approaches have been limited to larger species (greater than 250 g for GPS tags) and to those intermediate-sized species that return to a site for recapture (down to 12 g for geolocator tags; which excludes most small passerines), we still lack detailed data on wide-scale species- and population-specific movements for the majority of migratory species [
