<p class="p">Based on the median range projections to 2000 climate, we estimate that the current journeys of long-distance migrants will take on average 28.8 days (±11.0 days). Based on an ensemble of future projections, we project that the duration of migration for long-distance migrants will increase significantly by 2070 (paired

Specifically, there are significant increases between the estimates of future and current migration duration for 84% of long-distance migrant species. By contrast, for short-distance migrants, no overall change in the duration of migration is projected (paired

Simulation results (mean and standard deviations of migration distance, duration and number of stopovers across the 1000 randomly sampled migration journeys) for each species, model and climate scenario can be found in the electronic supplementary material, appendix S3.
