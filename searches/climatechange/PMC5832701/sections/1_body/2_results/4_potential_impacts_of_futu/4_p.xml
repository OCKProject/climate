<p class="p">The projected future breeding and non-breeding ranges derived from individual future climate projections did not differ substantially in terms of distribution and extent from the ensemble mean projections. In all future scenarios, all species of long-distance migrants are projected to experience increased migration distances. The 95% quantiles of the mean change in migration distance across all future projections (3 GCMs × 4 RCPs) only overlapped with zero for six out of the 37 species of long-distance migrants (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). This suggests that the projected increases in migration distance for long-distance migrants are consistent, regardless of future climate projections. The variation in potential migratory distances within species (based on the 1000 paired start and end points) between the 2000 and 2070 periods is substantial. For example, only three species of long-distance migrants showed an increase in their migration distance for which the standard deviation around the mean increases did not include zero (
