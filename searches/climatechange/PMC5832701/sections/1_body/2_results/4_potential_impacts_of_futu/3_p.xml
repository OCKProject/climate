For short-distance migrants, we predict both their breeding and non-breeding ranges to shift in broadly similar directions, and thus we predict no consistent overall change in migratory distances (paired

For 18% of short-distance migrants, there were significant increases in the estimates of future migration distance relative to current estimates of migration distance. A linear regression of mean 2070 migration distance on mean 2000 migration distance for long-distance migrants produces a slope that differs significantly from 1 (

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.29, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.03). The same regression for short-distance migrants produces a slope that does not differ significantly from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 1.08, s.e. = 0.09, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1.49, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.14). This suggests a difference in the proportional change in migration distance in relation to current migration distance and migratory strategy. More specifically, long-distance migrants are projected to increase their relative migration distance more than short-distance migrants (
