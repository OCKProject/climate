<p class="p">Migration distance data (from tracked individuals) were available for four of the eight species with validation data available (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). For two species, 
 <italic class="italic">Acrocephalus arundinaceus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Anthus campestris</italic>, our predicted estimates of migratory distance accorded well with the observed data. Migration distances were under-predicted for the same two species for which we under-predicted migration duration. For 
 <italic class="italic">Apus apus</italic>, we predicted a mean migration distance of 6313 km (±243 km), compared with the observed mean migration distance of 9208 km (±871 km). For 
 <italic class="italic">Lanius collurio</italic> we predicted a mean migration distance of 8369 km (±328 km) compared with the observed mean migration distance of 11 862 km (±372 km).
