<p class="p">Based on geolocator tracking studies, our estimates of the total duration of the migratory journey for the 2000 period compared favourably with the recorded journey for most (6/8; 75%) of the species (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). For 
 <italic class="italic">Apus apus</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 empirical measurements of migratory duration), we significantly under-predicted the duration of migration, predicting a mean migratory journey of 17.8 days (±0.17 days), in contrast to the observed mean migratory duration of 29 days (± 5.9 days). For 
 <italic class="italic">Lanius collurio</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) we also significantly under-predicted the duration of migration, predicting a mean migration duration of 49.1 days (±2.1 days), in contrast to the mean observed migration duration of 62.8 days (±6.1 days).
