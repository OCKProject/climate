<p class="p">We modelled the relationship between species' distributions and the mean of four commonly used bioclimatic variables (mean temperature of the coldest month; growing degree days above 5°; annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality) for the period 1950–2000, hereafter referred to as 2000. To achieve this, we used an ensemble modelling framework, combining four widely applied techniques: generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), generalized boosted regression models (GBMs) and random forests (RFs). Separate species distribution models (SDMs) were built for each species’s breeding and non-breeding ranges following published methods [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This approach resulted in 40 models (10 sampling blocks × 4 SDMs) for each species's breeding and non-breeding range. For each species, the 40 models were used to predict the probability that a 0.5° × 0.5° grid cell contains suitable climate during the 2000 period and for 12 climate projections—3 general circulation models (GCMs) × 4 representative concentration pathways (RCPs)—for the future time period, 2061–2080 (hereafter referred to as 2070). This was carried out separately for each species’s breeding and non-breeding range. The median suitability of a cell was taken from across the 40 model predictions for each climate scenario, and a threshold (the calculation of which is detailed in electronic supplementary material, appendix S1) applied to convert to binary predictions of presence or absence. Further details of the calculation of bioclimatic variables, the four SDM modelling approaches, the GCMs and RCPs, and the methods used to account for spatial autocorrelation and to perform model projection, can be found in electronic supplementary material, appendix S1.
