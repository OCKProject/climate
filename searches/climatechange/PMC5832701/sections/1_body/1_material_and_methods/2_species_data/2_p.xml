<p class="p">Species’ distribution data were compiled for migratory passerine and near-passerine bird species breeding in Europe, focusing on 77 migratory species included in the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. We classified these species into two approximately equal groups according to their migratory strategy: (i) 40 species of short-distance migrants, which migrate principally to Europe and North Africa for the non-breeding season; and (ii) 37 species of long-distance migrants, which spend the non-breeding season entirely in sub-Saharan Africa (see electronic supplementary material, table S1 for classifications). Distribution maps were obtained as separate breeding and non-breeding range polygons for each species [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The distribution maps of each species' breeding range were intersected with a 0.5° × 0.5° grid (approx. 50 × 50 km) covering Eurasia west of 52°E and the area of Africa north of 20°N. A species was considered present in a 0.5° grid cell if the cell intersected with the species’ breeding range. The non-breeding ranges of migrants were similarly intersected with a 0.5° grid and converted to presence–absence data across Eurasia (west of 52°E) and Africa.
