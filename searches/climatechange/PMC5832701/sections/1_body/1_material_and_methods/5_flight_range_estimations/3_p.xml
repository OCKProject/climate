<p class="p">The total time taken to migrate comprised four periods: (i) the time taken for an individual to complete the initial migratory flight, (ii) the total time taken to complete flights between stopovers, (iii) the time taken to travel between the last stopover and the final destination and (iv) the time spent at refuelling stopovers. Each species was classified as either a primarily nocturnal or a diurnal migrant (see electronic supplementary material, appendix S2 for classifications). The total number of hours spent flying (summing (i)–(iii) above) was then divided by either nine for nocturnal migrants (the mean number of hours of darkness during spring migrations) or by 15 for diurnal migrants (the mean number of daylight hours during spring migrations). This provided an estimate of the number of days it would take to complete the flight components of the migratory journey, which we then added to the time spent refuelling at stopovers (5 days × the number of stopovers) to provide an estimate of the total duration of the migratory journey.</p>
