<p class="p">To visualize how migration distance and the required number of stopovers might alter under climate change for two typical long-distance migrant species (
 <italic class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</italic>, collared flycatcher; 
 <italic class="italic">Sylvia nisoria,</italic> barred warbler), we plotted the predictions of these two species' current and future breeding and non-breeding ranges, and overlaid the central 90% of the 1000 randomly sampled migration journeys at any given longitude for both current and future scenarios. All analyses were carried out in R v. 3.3.1 [
