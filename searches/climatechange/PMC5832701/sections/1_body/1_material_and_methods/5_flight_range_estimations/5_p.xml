<p class="p">We compared migration distances for 2000 and 2070 time periods for both short- and long-distance migrants, and also examined the relative change in migratory distance for these species. Comparisons were made both within species (to compare the 1000 estimates of current and future migration distance for each species) and across all 77 species (to compare mean estimates of current and future migration distance), using 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests in both cases. A linear regression was used to assess the relationship between mean current and mean future migration distance for short- and long-distance migrants. A deviation of the slope of the regression from unity would indicate that future migration distances were projected to change disproportionately for longer- versus shorter-distance migrants. We then assessed changes in the modelled durations of the migratory journey between current and future using 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests. We also used 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests to compare the mean number of stopovers required currently and in future across all 77 species.
