<p class="p">For those species for which data are available, we compared our estimates of the total migratory distance, duration and required number of stopovers with migratory track data obtained from published geolocator studies. Given the paucity of such studies available for passerine species, we were able to obtain data with an acceptable sample size (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> ≥ 6) for only eight out the 77 species. We compared our estimates with spring migrations, as these are generally regarded to be more direct than autumn migrations, and hence are more comparable with our straight line estimates of migration [
 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Using a Mann–Whitney test, we compared the observed distance, duration and number of stopovers of spring migrations with a random sample, equal in number to the sample size of the published study, from the 1000 estimates produced when estimating migration distance. We repeated this 1000 times for each species and report the mean test statistics.
