<p class="p">To provide a measure of the distance that a species may have to travel during migration, we first selected a cell that was predicted to be occupied by that species in the non-breeding range for the 2000 period. Cell selection was random but weighted by the median climate suitability across the 40 model projections. We repeated this step for the species's breeding range for the 2000 period, to provide start and endpoints for a migratory journey. We make two assumptions in estimating migratory distances and durations: (i) that individuals travel between the two points as quickly as possible (this is akin to spring migration, when individuals have an incentive to return to the breeding grounds rapidly [

We calculated the great-circle distance between pairs of points, using the ‘geosphere’ package in R [

 <xref rid="RSPB20172329C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This process was repeated 1000 times; in addition to the mean of these migration distances, we report the standard deviation to reflect potential variation in migratory journeys for a single species in any period. This process was repeated for each of the 12 future climate scenarios.
