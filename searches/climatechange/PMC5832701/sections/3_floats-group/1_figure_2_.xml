   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) Predicted 2000 and 2070 migration distances for 77 European migratory bird species. Mean migration distance is calculated as the mean distance between 1000 randomly sampled points on the breeding and non-breeding grounds. Current distributions are taken as the median probability of occurrence for each grid cell from across 40 predictions (4 SDMs × 10 jackknife iterations) using contemporary (2000) climate data. Future distributions are taken as the median probability of occurrence for each grid cell across all 40 predictions for 12 climate scenarios (3 GCMs × 4RCPs) for 2070. Error bars show the standard deviation around the mean of the 1000 migration distances. The grey line indicates the 1 : 1 line. (
