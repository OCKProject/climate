  <p class="p">Shifts in the the distance and direction between 2000 and projected 2070 breeding and non-breeding ranges for (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) short-distance migrants and (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) long-distance migrants. Each line represents a single species. The centre of each polar plot represents the centre of the current (2000) range for each species, taken as the mean of 1000 randomly selected points from the median projection to contemporary climate data. Lines show distance to the centre of the future (2070) range, calculated by taking the mean of 1000 randomly selected points (weighted by probability of occurrence) from the median projection for each of the 12 climate scenarios (3 GCMs Ã— 4 RCPs). Shaded areas represent the standard deviation around the mean range centre from across the 12 different climate scenarios.
