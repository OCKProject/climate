<p class="p">The effect of environmental and climate change has been studied for a few African plant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Global studies indicate that large proportions of suitable habitat and the respective species will be lost during this century due to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, climate change will also affect intraspecific genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Studying the effects of climatic alterations on genetic diversity is necessary if we are to understand the evolutionary consequences of climate change and its long-term effects on species distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. To assess future impacts on biodiversity many studies have used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s (IPCC) scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios, which project emissions and socio-economic changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The latest set of climate model simulations assumes four different sets of possible futures. They are known as the Representation Concentration Pathways (RCPs) representing low (RCP 2.6), medium (RCPs 4.5 and 6.0) or high (RCP 8.5) emissions [
