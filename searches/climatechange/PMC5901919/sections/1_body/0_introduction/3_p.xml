<p class="p">In the sub-Saharan zone, one important species is 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> (L.) 
 <italic class="italic">Britton</italic>. (Fabaceae), syn. 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia senegal</italic> (L.) Willd. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The species, which is known for its exudate named ‘gum arabic’, is a small deciduous tree, native to arid and semi-desert regions of sub-Saharan Africa, but has also been introduced in other regions (e.g. the Indian sub-continent) [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In western Africa, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> naturally occurs either as a dominant extensive pure stand or in co-habitation with other species in a variety of vegetation types, including semi-desert grassland, 
 <italic class="italic">Anogeissus</italic> woodland and rocky hill slopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The species can grow on sandy, skeletal and slightly loamy soils. However, it shows preference for coarse-texture soils such as fossil dunes, with a soil pH of 5 to 8. Although 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> has been observed to grow in areas that receive 100 to 950 mm annual rainfall, it thrives best in areas with 300 to 400 mm annual rainfall. The species can tolerate five to 11 months of drought and can survive temperatures high as 43°C, dry wind and sandstorms, but is highly sensitive to frost. The altitude ranges from 100 to 1700 metres above sea level within the African ASAL. The species is insect-pollinated, and predominantly out-crossing [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Seeds are dispersed at least partly by animals, especially ungulates [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The astringent, emulsifying, film-forming and encapsulating properties of the gum arabic represents an important economic resource, which is often used in the food-processing, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and lithographic ink industries [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In addition to playing a preferential role in the context of land degradation and desertification control, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> has been reported to be resilient to drought and grazing making it an important species in agroforestry systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The current conservation status of the species is “least concern” (IUCN). However, field observations show that the species is locally under intense pressure from animal grazing, pest and human activities (personal observation) thus corroborating the earlier report of Eisa et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In addition, climate change will likely further increase the vulnerability of the species through disturbances of natural habitat. As a consequence, 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> conservation and future utility of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> could be jeopardized [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], with obvious repercussions for human livelihoods. Various aspects including soil physicochemical properties [

 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic>, intraspecific genetic variation has been studied both on regional levels [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and for range-wide phylogeography [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The latter shows a recent range expansion to west Africa with genetic diversity reported to be low in the region [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, no detailed analyses are available for the SSZ of West Africa where the available phylogeographic analysis is characterized by sampling gaps.
