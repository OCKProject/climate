<p class="p">This study aims to fill existing sampling gaps and identify genetic diversity and population structure of 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> (L.) 
 <italic class="italic">Britton</italic>. in the SSZ of West Africa. We used both nuclear and maternally inherited plastid microsatellite markers. Furthermore, we used species distribution modelling to forecast the potential range loss and loss of intra-specific genetic diversity under climate change and promote strategies towards effective management and conservation of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> in the West African SSZ. Specifically, we address the following questions: 1) Is the genetic diversity in the West African SSZ as low as previously stated for the region? 2) How is genetic diversity structured within the West African SSZ? 3) How would future climate impact the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> in the West African SSZ? We discuss the potential impact of climate driven range changes of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> in the SSZ of West Africa on extant genetic variation.
