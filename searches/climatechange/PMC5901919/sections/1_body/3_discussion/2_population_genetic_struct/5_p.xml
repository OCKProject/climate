<p class="p">The detected haplotypes, however, showed relationships amongst them and the populations to which they were affiliated. Of particular importance is H6 which is quite distinct appearing in only one population (YUS), with at least six and nine mutations between the two closest dominant relatives (H2 and H4). Although this study does not account for the origin of haplotypes, a colonization event probably from MDG to YUS, or somewhere farther from the east, cannot be neglected.</p>
