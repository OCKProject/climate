<p class="p">Overall, there is isolation by distance which is in line with gene-flow drift equilibrium and seed dispersal by animals because with geographical clustering, effects of environment cannot be totally excluded. Therefore, isolation-by-environment [

However, because there is congruence in the result obtained from both nSSR and cpSSR, the whole pattern is very likely to be primarily historic (seed dispersal), rather than adaptive, but this study cannot establish if the disjunct pattern is due to isolation by distance or/and isolation by environment.
