<p class="p">There was a strong difference in the extent of genetic structuring revealed by the two types of markers (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.14 for nSSRs and F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.86 for cpSSRs), indicating a much stronger differentiation of the chloroplast genome compared to the nuclear genome. Such differences are commonly observed and are to be expected due to the different types of inheritance and mode of dispersal [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Low to moderate values of nuclear population differentiation have previously been documented in 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegalia</italic> and were attributed to likely intense gene flow [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. However, as F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values only mirror the effects of past events, weak genetic differentiation among populations could also be observed if populations were young, shared a common ancestry and were only weakly differentiated despite lack of current gene flow. The high F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values in the chloroplast data set suggest that gene flow via seeds is negligible, thus highlighting the importance of pollen vs. seed dispersal for the connectivity of population cohesion in the species [
