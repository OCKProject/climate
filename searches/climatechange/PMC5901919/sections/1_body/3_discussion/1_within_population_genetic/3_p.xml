<p class="p">Furthermore, Wang et al., [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] reported that a speciesâ€™ geographic range and its ecological attributes influenced genetic diversity; and that high heterozygosity favoured long-lived plants especially in the arid zones. Our study is congruent with this assumption and is of particular importance when the historical range shifts
