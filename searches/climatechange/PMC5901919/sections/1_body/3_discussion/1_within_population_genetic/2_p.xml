<p class="p">Half of the investigated sites significantly deviated from HWE. Moderate F
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> values were found in one population, indicating a heterozygote deficit. Such a reduction can either be explained by the presence of null alleles [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], the Wahlund effect, or a non-panmictic mating system [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. As null alleles or Wahlund effects are not evident in our findings, we attribute the deviation from HWE at location HAD (F
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> = 0.12) to inbreeding and limited gene-flow consistent with isolation and small population size. On the other hand, heterozygote excess, which was found in six sites, could potentially be due to selection for heterozygosity (i.e. heterozygote advantage), or self-incompatibility and obligate outcrossing [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. This finding coupled with F
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub> estimates (mean = 0.06) obtained from our study is in agreement with earlier reports [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] suggesting that

 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> is almost exclusively outcrossed and self-incompatible. Studies on morphology and genetic variation of some tropical species showed that outcrossed genotypes also grew faster and had lower mortality than progeny from selfing, resulting in a greater heterozygosity in the populations due to the selective loss of homozygous individuals [
