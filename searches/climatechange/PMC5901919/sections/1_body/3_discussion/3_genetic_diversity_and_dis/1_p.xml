<p class="p">The MaxEnt model confirms the role of soil and climate properties in shaping the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> in the SSZ, as reported by Traore 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Given the future climate scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C–5J</xref>), there will be likely a reduction of suitable habitats and population sizes, and potentially a loss of private alleles and private haplotypes leading to declining genetic diversity. All four future climate scenarios vary in magnitude of energy imbalance and the impact of the variation is reflected in the model forecast, as the extent of reduction in suitable range is largely dependent on the species’ ecological requirements. The observed predicted pattern shows a progressive reduction (RCP2.6 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP6.0 &gt; RCP8.5) of the current potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> within the study area. This shows that 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> may be under threat due to environmental change in the study area and the species might be facing an increased risk of local extinction. However, considering the high allele diversity found in this study, populations may show a predisposition to maintain genetic diversity which may ultimately be a favorable potential for adaptability and persistence should they disperse to track a new suitable range. Consequently, the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> to persist in an increasingly marginal range will depend on factors such as ecological fitness, genetic make-up and dispersal ability. However, there is no certainty that the dispersal rates of plant species could keep pace with fast rates of environmental change [
