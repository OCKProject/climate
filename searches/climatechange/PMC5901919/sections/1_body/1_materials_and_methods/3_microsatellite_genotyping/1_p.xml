<p class="p">Total genomic DNA was extracted from 30 mg of silica-dried leaves using a Nucleo-spin plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). We used ten nuclear microsatellites (hereafter nSSR) specifically designed for

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]: ccmp5 and ccmp10. DNA amplification was performed using a multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). The PCR mix contained a final volume of 10 μl with 5 μl of 2X Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix, 1 μl of Primer mix (0.2 μM of each forward and reverse primers), 1 μl of Q-Solution, 1 μl of RNase free water and 2 μl of template DNA (10 ng/μl). The PCR was initially heated to 95°C for 15 min, followed by a 3-step touchdown cycling programme consisting of denaturation at 95 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 15 mins, annealing at 67 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 1.5 mins, extension at 72 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 1 min, followed by eight cycles of 94

 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 1.5 min, 72 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 1 min, and a final extension at 60 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C for 30 min. Amplification was carried out separately for each primer pair in a singleplex-PCR and combined for fragment analysis. PCR products were amplified using 6-FAM-, VIC-, NED-, and PET-labelled primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The touchdown cycling program was used on a Mastercycler 2050 model thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). PCR products were sequenced on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using LIZ 500 or LIZ 600. Allelic binning and scoring of genotypes were performed using GeneMapper v.5.0 (Applied Biosystems). Raw data matrices containing allelic information were double-checked for scoring errors. Samples with more than two missing loci were excluded from further analysis. The final data set consisted of 287 samples for nSSR and 303 samples for cpSSR analyses.
