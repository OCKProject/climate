<p class="p">The sampled point locations (n = 316) were initially increased with 30 records from the GBIF database [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The dataset was extensively cleaned with doubtful localities and multiple records within a 30 arc-second gridcell (approximately 1x1 km, see below) being removed. The final set of point locations (n = 251) was then used for estimating the potential distribution of the species. Additionally, pseudo-absence data were created with the same number of points as the presence data (n = 251). Pseudo-absences were randomly generated across the study area with a minimum distance of 1.5 km to each other and the presence localities. Equal numbers of presence and pseudo-absence were used as recommended by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Nineteen bioclimatic variables, together with three topographic (DEM; DEM-derived) variables with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds were downloaded from the public WorldClim database [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. These variables describe interpolated monthly means of climatic/environmental factors. Additional 66 soil variables with a resolution of 250 meters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194726.s005" class="xref">S5 Table</xref>) were downloaded from the online database Soildgrids250m [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The complete set of variables was resampled to 30 arc-seconds spatial resolution in the WGS 84 coordinate system.
