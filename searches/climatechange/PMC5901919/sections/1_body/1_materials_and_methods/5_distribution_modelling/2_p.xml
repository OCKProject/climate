<p class="p">The impact of climate change on the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> was assessed using WorldClimâ€™s future climate change scenarios. We selected two future climate change projections (2050 and 2070) from two global climate models (GISS-ER2 [

 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] and CCSM4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], hereafter GCM) and four RCP scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Moreover, topographic and soil variables were considered constant in future scenarios. Distribution modeling (current and future) of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> was computed with a maximum entropy approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] as implemented in MaxEnt v.3.3.3k [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Model performance was evaluated by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot. The final model was selected as the one with highest AUC score [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Variable selection was performed in two steps: First, collinear variables were deleted stepwise considering a variance inflation factor (VIF) &gt; 10 as critical threshold [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] using the '
 <italic class="italic">usdm'</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], reducing the number of variables to n = 12. Second, the final set of environmental variables was chosen based on the optimization of the AUC value by the Random Forest (RF) model using the '
 <italic class="italic">AUC-RF'</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], resulting in seven environmental predictors for the final model. In order to assess area gains and losses, we re-classified current and future habitat suitability probability scores into binary data by a threshold equal to prevalence [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. We then estimated the degree of total area change as the percentage of remaining area in comparison with the current distribution. Values above 100% represent expansion (gain of area distribution) and values below 100% represent the diminution of the total extend from the current prediction. In addition, we mapped the changes between the current and future habitat suitability scores of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> for each 30 arc-second grid cell. Differences were classified as follows: 1) not present, low probability of occurrence in current and future predictions (&lt;75%); 2) area loss, high probability in the current prediction and low in the future; 3) area gain, low probability of occurrence (&lt;75%) in the current situation and high in future predictions (&gt;75%) and 4) remain, high probability of occurrence (&gt;75%) as previously done by [
