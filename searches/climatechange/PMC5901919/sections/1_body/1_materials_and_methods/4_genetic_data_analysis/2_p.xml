<p class="p">For the cpSSR data, HAPLOTYPE v.1.05 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] was used to estimate the number of alleles at chloroplast SSR loci (N
 <sub class="sub">acpSSR</sub>), number of haplotypes detected in each population (N
 <sub class="sub">b</sub>), effective number of haplotypes (N
 <sub class="sub">e</sub>), genetic diversity (Dv), haplotype richness (H
 <sub class="sub">r</sub>) and the number of private haplotypes (Prv). A parsimony network illustrating genetic relationships between haplotypes was inferred using the software PopArt [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], assuming single-step mutations between alleles. Total genetic variation among samples was calculated using the phi-statistics of AMOVA which was performed using GenAlex [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This total variation was partitioned at three levelsâ€”within populations (Phi-PT), among populations within clusters (Phi-PR), and among clusters (Phi-RT) [
