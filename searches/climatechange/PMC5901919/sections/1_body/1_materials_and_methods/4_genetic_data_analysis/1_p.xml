<p class="p">We used the program MicroChecker v.2.2.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] to estimate the frequency of Null alleles across all samples. For the nSSR data set, intrapopulation genetic diversity was estimated as the total number of alleles per locus and per population (NA), the average number of alleles per locus for each population over all loci (A
 <sub class="sub">avr</sub>), the unbiased estimate of expected (H
 <sub class="sub">E</sub>) and observed (H
 <sub class="sub">O</sub>) heterozygosity [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] within populations using Arlequin v.3.5.1.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The number of private alleles (A
 <sub class="sub">PRIV</sub>) was estimated using GDA v.1.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. FSTAT v.1.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] was used to calculate allelic richness (A
 <sub class="sub">R</sub>), thus correcting for different sample sizes, and inbreeding coefficient (F
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub>). The package genepop v.1.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] was used to perform exact tests of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and F-statistics estimated by Weir and Cockerhan [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Population genetic structure was evaluated using a Bayesian clustering approach, implemented in STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Individual’s genotype association from 1 to 13 distinct genetic clusters (K), allowing for admixture, was performed 20 times for each K with 500,000 generations as burn-in period, followed by 500,000 iterations of MCMC analysis assuming that the different populations had correlated allele frequencies without using prior information on the sampling locations of each individual [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The “Evanno method” [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] was used to estimate the most likely K [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], as implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], but we also scrutinized results of other K for biologically meaningful solutions. To estimate population genetic differentiation, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed based on the clusters suggested by the STRUCTURE analysis using GenAlex v.6. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. We tested for isolation by distance (IBD) based on the correlation between genetic and geographical distances between populations using a Mantel test as implemented in GenAlex v.6. [
 <xref rid="pone.0194726.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>].
