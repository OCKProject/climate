<p class="p">Fresh leaf samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> were collected from thirteen localities along the fringes of the gum arabic belt, situated between latitude 11°N and 13°N and longitude -0.1°W and 13.2°E between 2012 and 2016. The study area is a mixture of tropical woodland, grassland savannah and semi-desert steppe that transverses the SSZ and extends eastwards from north-eastern Ghana to north-eastern Nigeria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The spatial distances between neighbouring collection sites ranged between 35 km (BIR–GUR) and 1,500 km (BKG–MDG). The sample size per site was between 13 and 32 individuals, with a total of 316 samples. Within sites distance was between 10 m and 10 km, depending on the size of the population. Details of parameters sampled from the sites are shown in
