The Mantel test with 999 permutations revealed that genetic divergence of populations was correlated with geographic distance (r = 0.53; P = 0.001) indicating that the isolation by distance model cannot be rejected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Despite this significant IBD pattern, the geographically very distant but genetically close population MDG within the green nSSR cluster indicates the presence of a larger-scale phylogeographical structure that is not consistent with IBD.
