<p class="p">Bayesian analysis of population structure using nSSR suggested the presence of two genetically distinct clusters based on the Evanno method [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>) cannot be neglected as it had higher mean likelihood L(K) and still a large value of ΔK. Samples from four geographical populations (BKG, ZUR, SOK and MDG) were affiliated to cluster 1 (green, cluster membership coefficient &gt; 96%). This cluster comprised three populations from the western-most and one from the eastern-most part of the study area. Samples from nine geographical populations made up the red cluster at K = 2 (membership coefficient between 65.4 and 98%), which was again separated at K = 3 into two: cluster 2 (MAD, AGU, GOU–brown) and cluster 3 (RUM, HAD, BRN, GUR, JAK–orange). Population YUS was highly mixed and shared ancestry between clusters 2 and 3 (49% vs 47%). This separation reflected a latitudinal pattern with the northern-most populations making up cluster 2 leaving six populations in the central part of the study area as cluster 3. Population YUS showed mixed ancestry with 49% and 47% affiliation to clusters 2 and 3, respectively (
