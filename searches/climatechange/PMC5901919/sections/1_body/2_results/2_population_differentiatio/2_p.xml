<p class="p">With respect to cpSSR, 12 out of the 13 populations were either fixed to a single cpDNA haplotype or had a highly dominant haplotype (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194726.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). The population structure at cpSSR loci closely resembled the one at nSSR. While H2 was present in all four populations making up cluster 1, H5 was dominant in populations of cluster 2 and H4 in populations that corresponded to cluster 3. Similar to the nSSR data set, population YUS was mixed of two haplotypes (H4, H6).
