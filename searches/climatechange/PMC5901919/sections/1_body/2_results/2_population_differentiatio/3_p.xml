<p class="p">With the nuclear data set, non-hierarchical AMOVA revealed 13% variation among and 87% of genetic variation residing within populations (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.14; P ≤ 0.001). A hierarchical AMOVA revealed that 18% of the variation resided among clusters at K = 2, while 5% and 77% resided among and within populations (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.23; P ≤ 0.001). Considering three clusters, differences among the clusters accounted for 13.5% while variation among and within populations accounted for 4% and 82.5% (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.18; P ≤ 0.001) respectively. By contrast, cpSSR non-hierarchical data showed 85% variation among and 15% of genetic variation residing within populations (PhiPT = 0.86; P ≤ 0.001). A hierarchical AMOVA (K = 2) found 51% of the total genetic variance between populations from different clusters (PhiPT = 0.86). Among populations within clusters contributed 39% of the total genetic variance (PhiPR), and 10% of the genetic variation was obtained from within individual populations (PhiPT = 0.89). All three levels contributed significantly to the overall genetic variation as determined through the permutation analyses (
