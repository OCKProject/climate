 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> in West Africa is most strongly correlated with extractable nitrogen, coarse fragments, soil organic carbon stock, precipitation of warmest and coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest month and mean temperature of driest quarter (

Trends in future distribution were similarly forecasted by both GCM but only the resulting maps from GISSER2 are displayed. Our dataset shows that 35.34% to 11.39% of the current potential range of the species will favourably support the species’ ecological requirements across all the scenarios by the year 2050 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C–5F</xref>). Consequently, by the year 2070, projections show that only 40.96% and 6.34% of the species’ current potential distribution might persist favourably under low emission (RCP 2.6) and high emission (RCP 8.5) scenarios, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194726.g005" class="xref">Fig 5G–5J</xref>). In addition, both GCMs predict a stabilization of habitat loss between 2050 and 2070 under RCP 2.6, while all other scenarios predict additional habitat loss from 2050 to 2070 (
