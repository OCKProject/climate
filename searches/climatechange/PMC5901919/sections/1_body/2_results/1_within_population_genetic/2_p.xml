<p class="p">Genetic diversity parameters and locus level estimates for cpSSR loci are summarised in Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194726.s004" class="xref">S4</xref> respectively. Both cpSSR loci were polymorphic, exhibiting three (ccmp5) and five (ccmp10) alleles per locus among the 303 samples. The combination of alleles resulted in 6 unique haplotypes. Haplotypes H4, H5 and H2 were most frequent occuring in 119, 85 and 79 individuals respectively, whereas H6 was found 14 times and haplotypes H1 and H3 only once. Three haplotypes (H1, H3 and H6) were present in only one population each. Populations YUS harboured two private haplotypes while BRN harboured one private haplotype (Tables
