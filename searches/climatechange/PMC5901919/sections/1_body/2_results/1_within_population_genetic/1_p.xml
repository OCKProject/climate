<p class="p">In total, 110 alleles were scored across ten nSSR loci for the 287 genotyped individuals (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194726.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). None of the loci exhibited null allele presence. At the population level, observed and expected heterozygosity values for nSSR markers ranged from 0.42 to 0.73 (mean 0.61) and 0.43 to 0.63 (mean 0.56), respectively. Allelic richness ranged from 2.86 to 4.55 with a mean of 3.71. Private alleles were identified in eleven populations, with GOU having the highest number of four private alleles. Significant deviations from HWE were detected at seven sites with heterozygote deficiency in one site (HAD) and heterozygote excess in six sites (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0194726.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) while measures of inbreeding coefficient (Fis) were generally negative or very low ranging from -0.28 to 0.12 (mean = -0.06).
