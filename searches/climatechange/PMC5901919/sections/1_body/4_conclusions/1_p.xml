<p class="p">Our study unveiled a high genetic and haplotypic variation in the West African Sudano-Sahelian range of 
 <italic class="italic">Senegalia senegal</italic> in contrast to previous report that found this part of the range genetically homogenous. We suggest that the speciesâ€™ colonization history might have played an important role in the distribution of genetic diversity and structuring of populations in the study area. Distribution modeling indicates that depending on the climate scenario, only 41% (RCP 2.6), 35% (RCP 4.5) or down to only 6.3 (RCP 8.5) of suitable area will be available. Consequently, a large part of the geographically structured genetic variation is threatened. In particular the genotypes distributed to the West of the study area, microsatellite cluster 1 and chloroplast haplotype 2, may face strong declines, as hardly any surviving 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">senegal</italic> are predicted in this region. Our findings therefore offer insights into how to manage threats or predict responses to disturbances in relation to environmental changes. Finally, the findings of this study will provide a valuable base to reinforce the information available to conservationists and policy makers.
