 </sup> Instead, an indicator variable was used for county as a covariate. Predictors were selected from independent variables that demonstrated statistically significant associations with dependent variables in bivariate analyses. Stepwise analyses and Wald tests were used to determine model fit. All models controlled for county, age, and political party affiliation (“other covariates”).
