<p class="p">An online survey was conducted among residents of select counties from July 5–12, 2018. Participants were recruited from online research panels using a nonprobability sampling method. Potential respondents were randomly drawn from the population of panel members and invited to participate using email and mobile app alerts. Sampling quotas reflected regional distributions of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Inclusion criteria were being aged 18 years or older, a current full-time resident of select counties in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, or Santa Barbara), Florida (Miami-Dade or Broward), or Arizona (Maricopa) for at least 12 months, and recalling at least one of the following events within 50 miles of their home in the past 12 months: extreme heat (temperatures at least 10° higher than is normal for the region, lasting for several weeks), drought, flooding (flash floods, coastal or river flooding, and/or flooded city streets), hurricane/tropical storm, landslide/mudslide, and/or wildfire. Of the 1165 respondents who responded to the invitation, 77.4% met inclusion criteria. The survey had an 85.5% completion rate, resulting in a sample of 615 respondents. Of these, 2 were from Santa Barbara and 8 from Ventura counties; these counties were dropped from the analyses, resulting in a final sample size of 605.</p>
