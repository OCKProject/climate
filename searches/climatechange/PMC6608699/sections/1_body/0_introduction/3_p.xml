<p class="p">Beyond managing immediate effects of extreme weather events, public health interventions must also address the upstream contributors to inequities (e.g., societal, economic, political) if they are to address health impacts in populations with greater social or medical vulnerability to climate change.

 </sup> Adaptation and mitigation approaches should be carefully implemented so they do not exacerbate health disparities.

 </sup> For example, an unintended consequence of increasing neighborhood green spaces may be gentrification, increasing property values to the point of displacing low-income residents and locally owned businesses. Using air conditioning during extreme heat waves—a short-term protective action—is costly, energy-intensive, increases street-level heat, and can overload power grids. Alternately, adaptation and mitigation can present opportunities to address systemic contributors to climate-related health disparities that have co-benefits for multiple public health issues.
