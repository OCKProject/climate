<p class="p">Community members with greater vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change indicate elevated levels of interest in preparedness for, and prevention of, its impacts. Low-income residents in regions affected by extreme weather are among the most supportive of local structural policies toward mitigation, and interventions that offer public health co-benefits. Strengthening social services during extreme weather events is also critically important to low-income residents. Further research can identify barriers and contribute to the development and refinement of culturally competent, accessible interventions that facilitate decisions surrounding preparedness and evacuation during extreme weather.</p>
