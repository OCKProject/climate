<p class="p">This study reveals that socially and medically vulnerable community members perceive certain interventions to be especially important, and significantly more so compared to less-vulnerable residents. Individuals from low-income households expressed stronger support for community-level structural policies compared to those with higher income. The structural interventions emphasized by low-income residents mainly address mitigation (laws on households and businesses to lower local pollution and greenhouse gas emissions; subsidizing the costs of energy-efficient appliances to low-income residents; providing financial incentives to homeowners to install cool roofs) with some adaptation benefits (requiring public spaces to implement heat island reduction strategies such as green or cool roofs, planting vegetation, installing cool pavements). Those from low-income households also expressed greater interest in the expansion of community gardens and local agriculture than higher-income community members, a mitigation approach that can provides co-benefits for public health by improving access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Low-income neighborhoods frequently have more limited access to affordable and fresh food, contributing to higher rates of obesity and related chronic conditions.
