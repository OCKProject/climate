<p class="p">This study provides evidence that racial and ethnic groups at increased risk of health impacts from climate change desire greater communication from their local government about acute and long-term changes in extreme weather, and mitigation. Black or Hispanic respondents felt more strongly that receiving information on preventing increases in intensity and frequency of extreme weather in the future was important, and were significantly more likely to emphasize the importance of yearly updates about local changes in extreme weather over time, compared to non-Black, non-Hispanic respondents. Hispanic respondents were more likely than non-Hispanics to emphasize the importance of making improvements in emergency alert systems during extreme weather events.</p>
