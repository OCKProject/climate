<p class="p">This study focuses on within-sample differences in attitudes about the importance of interventions according to respondent vulnerabilities to extreme weather. The prevalence of attitudes expressed by this sample should be interpreted with caution due to the nonprobability sampling technique used. Post-stratification weights, combined with sampling quotas, helped to achieve a sample that closely resembles the demographic characteristics of the counties of interest, but it cannot be considered representative. Online panels are vulnerable to selection bias, as those enrolling in a panel may systematically differ from the general population. Despite these limitations, an online panel provided unique benefits for this study. Achieving a probability-based sample within this study's restricted geographic areas would be costly and vulnerable to low response rates. A short data collection period helped to prevent history bias if new extreme weather events occurred during the study.</p>
