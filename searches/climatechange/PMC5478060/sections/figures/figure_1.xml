 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Schematic diagram representing the relationships between atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic components of subarctic and arctic freshwaters, and the processes by which climate change alters these environments. Linkages, specifically the effect of evaporation on precipitation, effect of wind regime on both ice‐cover duration and habitat stratification, are not shown to maintain clarity (see text for details). These linkages show that many of the environmental and ecological effects of climate change occur due to changes across all components of the subarctic environment. Arrows indicate the recorded or predicted direction of change (increases or decreases), and delta (∆) represents change that is not broadly generalizable within the region.</p>
