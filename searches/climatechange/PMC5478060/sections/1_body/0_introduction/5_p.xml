<p class="p">Identifying the mechanistic linkages between environmental drivers and ecological responses is essential for predicting the effects of climate change, particularly to determine the extent to which generalizations can be made. The aim of this synthesis is to explore the effects of climate change across multiple levels of ecological organization in subarctic freshwaters focussing primarily on fish. We first present a summary of the recorded or predicted environmental outcomes of climate change, including the encroachment of temperate species into subarctic regions before then illustrating how these changes manifest as ecological responses at individual, population, community, and ecosystem levels of organization. Changes in species distributions are a ubiquitous consequence of climate change and concern for conservation management. In the final section, we explore the invasion triangle concept (Perkins, Leger, &amp; Nowak, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) in subarctic freshwaters to provide an example of how the connections between climate change and species invasions need to be considered simultaneously, occasionally drawing on additional evidence from temperate regions.
