<p class="p">Climate change is most widely recognized for its effect on altered species distribution due to changes in thermal regimes (Buisson, Grenouillet, Villéger, Canal, &amp; Laffaille, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), emphasizing that species invasions are a potential mechanism driving climate change impacts. Here, we define invasive species as those that are expanding their distribution in response to climate change separate from species that have been moved by human agents beyond their natural range (Rahel &amp; Olden, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). For freshwater biota, particularly fish, this is evidenced by shifts in the distribution of warm‐ or cool‐water species toward higher elevations and latitudes and range retractions for cold‐water species (Bond, Thomson, Reich, &amp; Stein, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Chu, Mandrak, &amp; Minns, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Comte, Buisson, Daufresne, &amp; Grenouillet, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Graham &amp; Harrod, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Ecological effects of climate change therefore need to be understood in the context of multiple stressors because the effects of species invasions and climate change may be synergistic or antagonistic (sensu Folt, Chen, Moore, &amp; Burnaford, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Strayer, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0183" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, the ecological effects of climate change and species invasions are often explored in isolation or with little consideration of the effects of other environmental disturbances (e.g., Cucherousset &amp; Olden, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rehage &amp; Blanchard, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Simon &amp; Townsend, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Sousa, Novais, Costa, &amp; Strayer, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0181" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Woodward et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0205" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Current conceptualizations of invasive species under climate change research emphasize how climate change may potentially alter invasion opportunities and routes (Rehage &amp; Blanchard, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), with only a weaker understanding of how climate change determines the effects of invaders (e.g., Rahel &amp; Olden, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>, who propose how climate change can enhance or negate effects of freshwater invasive species). However, there has been increasing primary research effort in the processes and effects of invasive species under climate change in subarctic freshwaters since these initial theoretical developments. Therefore, there remains a dual need to first conceptualize how ecological effects of climate change are driven indirectly by the impacts of invasive species and second, how the effects of climate change influence the vulnerability of ecosystems to invasion and subsequent ecological responses.
