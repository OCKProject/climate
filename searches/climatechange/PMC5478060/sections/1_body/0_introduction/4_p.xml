<p class="p">Poleward range expansions of temperate freshwater species (e.g., Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) further signify the importance of subarctic regions as sentinel ecosystems for understanding climate change impacts. Previous reviews of the consequences of climate change for freshwater ecosystems (including those including subarctic regions) have emphasized (1) the responses of hydrological and physical environmental components (Prowse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), (2) effects on species range shifts and ecosystem function (Heino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wrona et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0206" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and (3) general responses across multiple levels of ecological organization in freshwaters predominantly independent of the effects of species invasions (Woodward et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0205" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). While our understanding of how patterns of freshwater biodiversity are expected to respond to climate change is developing (Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Heino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), how the responses to climate are integrated among multiple levels of organization in subarctic freshwaters have not yet been conceptualized. Such a synthesis is useful to both predict the context‐dependent responses to environmental or ecological changes and identify underlying causal mechanisms for future research (Simon &amp; Townsend, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>).
