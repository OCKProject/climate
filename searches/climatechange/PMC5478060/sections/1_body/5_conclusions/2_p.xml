<p class="p">This synthesis highlights the complex interplay between multiple environmental variables and invasive species in determining the effects of climate change in subarctic freshwater ecosystems across multiple levels of organization. Explicit integration of the effects of climate change and invasive species will produce more robust predictions and improved understanding of underlying mechanisms of the each stressor at both regional (e.g., subarctic) and global spatial extents. However, despite the concern of climate change and the subsequent risks to ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem services, this synthesis also highlights three key knowledge gaps relevant to drawing inferences and making predictions of the effects of climate change on both subarctic freshwaters and other ecosystem types. These gaps limit our understanding of the mechanisms by which of climate change induces ecological effects, which in turn restricts the ability to make strong predictions of climate change impacts.</p>
