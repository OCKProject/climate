<p class="p">Based on the literature synthesized here, changes in temperature and hydrology appear to be the primary environmental drivers of the ecological response to climate change in subarctic freshwaters (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32982-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). However, both drivers also have indirect secondary effects. For example, thawing of permafrost results in an influx of terrestrial‐sourced nutrients changing productivity regimes (Prowse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Furthermore, while it is often concluded that temperature and hydrological changes are important drivers of climate change impacts, these drivers need to be considered among a broader suite of environmental and ecological drivers (i.e., mechanisms). Without considering the range of mechanisms that affect the structure and functioning of subarctic freshwater ecosystems in reality, the effects of widely studied environmental variables (e.g., temperature) are likely to overstate the importance of such variables. It is clear from studies reviewed here that effects of climate on subarctic freshwaters are variable in space and dependent on habitat and catchment characteristics (e.g., Finstad et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Hayden, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>). Incorporating additional temporal and spatial covariables into future studies will improve understanding of the mechanisms through which climate change affects freshwater ecosystems and assist identifying environments that function as climate change refugia.
