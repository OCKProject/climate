<p class="p">Ecological effects of environmental change occur via multiple pathways linking different levels of organization. In many circumstances, these effects are first evident at the individual level before becoming evident at population, community, and ecosystem levels (Cucherousset &amp; Olden,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0184" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Climate change can impose ecological effects via either individual to ecosystem or ecosystem to individual pathways, which may operate simultaneously (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32982-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Temperature increases in lakes break down niche partitioning between individual fish by forcing competitors into the same depth layers (Busch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), increasing predation of zooplankton, and therefore causing top‐down trophic cascades (via individual to ecosystem pathways). In contrast, changes in populations and communities can occur due to increased flux of nutrients and energy from permafrost thaw to aquatic ecosystems, and increased turbidity from terrestrial carbon inputs reduces feeding success of visual‐feeding consumers (Herb et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), potentially causing localized extirpations due to joint effects of competitive disadvantage and oxygen deficit (Jacobson et al.,
