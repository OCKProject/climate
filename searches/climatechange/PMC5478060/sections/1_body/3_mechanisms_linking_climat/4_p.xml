<p class="p">The multitude of ecological mechanisms determining responses to climate, and the variability of those responses identified here for a single specific biome, suggests that there will be some difficulty in determining general principles of ecological responses to climate change at a global scale. Despite apparent consistency of changes in species distributions at regional and global scales across different ecological realms (Comte et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0167" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), inconsistencies in responses (i.e., positive, neutral, or negative) within distinct levels of ecological organization in subarctic freshwaters (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32982-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>) indicate that identifying mechanisms of climate change effects may have limited transferability. This limited transferability is evident across different species (reinforcing the fundamental importance of the biological and ecological traits of taxa in determining how the effects of climate change are manifested) and across different ecological biomes. Such context specificity is not a shortcoming for communicating future biodiversity status and implications for humans due to their unpredictability (e.g., Scheffers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0167" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In contrast, understanding the unique effects of climate change for different ecosystem types, biomes, and taxa is necessary for clearer predictive capacity and stronger adaptation potential at regional scales.
