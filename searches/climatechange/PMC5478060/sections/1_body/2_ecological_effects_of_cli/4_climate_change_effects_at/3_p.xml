<p class="p">Strong evidence exists that climate change affects biotic interactions within subarctic freshwater communities, leading to changes in community‐level attributes via trophic cascades. Altered abiotic conditions imposed by climate change may reduce the extent of trophic niche partitioning within freshwater systems. For example, whitefish and vendace (
 <italic class="italic">Coregonus albula</italic>) exhibit vertical segregation in deep, cold lakes, thereby reducing resource overlap (Gjelland, Bøhn, &amp; Amundsen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). However, increased temperature and lower dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion zone linked with climate change is predicted to force both species to occupy the same depth zones likely increasing interspecific competition (Gjelland et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Such changes in habitat use by multiple species are associated with increased densities of zooplankton at the warmer surface layers of lakes (due to predation release), yet zooplankton density may decline in the hypolimnetic zone where cold‐water fish become concentrated (Busch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Climate change also alters trophic dynamics via changes in community composition in subarctic lakes. For example, climate change has been linked to increased densities of benthic‐feeding cyprinid species in northern Europe (Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and their foraging behavior increases nutrient concentrations in the water column leading to higher phytoplankton densities and overall turbidity, which in turn contributes to reduced density of benthic macrophytes (e.g., Volta et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0197" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, top‐down control by fish in subarctic freshwaters appears to be dependent on habitat morphology and is more strongly evident in smaller, shallower habitats as opposed to larger and deeper lakes that support complex food webs and contain thermal refugia (Jyväsjärvi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). To date, climate change has predominantly contributed to species additions rather than complete replacements. Such additions have led to increased food chain length and food web size in subarctic freshwaters (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0187" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Woodward et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0205" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
