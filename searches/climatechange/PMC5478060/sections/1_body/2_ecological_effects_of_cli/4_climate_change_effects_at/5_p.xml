<p class="p">Community‐level responses to climate change in freshwaters are also driven by changes in the timing of recruitment and production of keystone prey or predator species. Temporal changes in the availability of prey and consumer density (i.e., predation pressure) suggest that temporal variation in bottom‐up and top‐down controls of population size within food webs occurs due to the effect of climate (McMeans et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). For example, lake temperature increases, particularly during spring–summer, lead to higher production and density of zooplankton (e.g.,

 <italic class="italic">Bosmina</italic> sp.) that are important prey sources for fish (Carter &amp; Schindler, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Furthermore, climate change can alter the temporal availability of zooplankton for predators by shortening or extending the period of synchronized predation by multiple consumers (Wagner et al.,

 <italic class="italic">Daphnia</italic> abundances decreased due to increased predation by yellow perch, a cool‐water species which recruited in early summer in lakes during 2004–2010, impacting the growth of late summer hatching bluegill sunfish (
