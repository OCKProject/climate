<p class="p">Climate change alters subarctic freshwater community interactions by influencing behavior and energetic demands of individuals and the abundance and structure of species populations. In turn, biotic interactions influenced by climate can have potential feedbacks for impacts at other levels of organization (e.g., species distribution; Wisz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Across Europe, fish community structure is largely governed by water thermal and productivity regimes and variation occurs as a continuum from cold‐climate northern communities (characterized by low species richness and dominated by salmonids), to cool‐climate (dominated by percid species) and warm‐climate communities in southern regions characterized by high species richness and a dominance on cyprinid fishes (Brucet et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Populations of cold‐climate species have declined, whereas warmer water species have increased across European lakes associated with climate change during the 20th century (Jeppesen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). For example, the range expansion of benthivorous percids (e.g., European perch and ruffe) into subarctic regions due to climate change has increased the prevalence of pelagic feeding by resident whitefish, leading to a lower density and body size of zooplankton, particularly in large and deep lakes (Hayden, Harrod, &amp; Kahilainen,
