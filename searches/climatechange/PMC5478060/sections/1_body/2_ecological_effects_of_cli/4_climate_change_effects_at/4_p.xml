<p class="p">Competitive interactions between fish in subarctic lakes are also driven by the duration of ice cover and timing of ice thaw, both of which are altered by climate change. Reduced body condition of native whitefish and continued active feeding by invasive ruffe are suggestive of increased competition for benthic prey under lake ice, leading to depletion of benthic resources during winter (Hayden, Harrod, Sonninen, &amp; Kahilainen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Light and temperature limitations during periods of ice cover restrict cladoceran zooplankton population growth almost exclusively to the ice‐free summer months (De Senerpont Domis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which leads to fishes shifting resource use between generalist foraging in summer and benthic foraging in winter (Eloranta, Kahilainen, &amp; Jones, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Hayden, Harrod, &amp; Kahilainen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013a</xref>). Where brown trout and Arctic charr occur in sympatry, population biomass of brown trout is negatively correlated with ice‐cover duration, suggesting that Arctic charr have a competitive advantage during periods of ice cover (Helland, Finstad, Forseth, Hesthagen, &amp; Ugedal,
