<p class="p">Effects of climate change on increased ecosystem productivity in subarctic freshwater will potentially mediate competitive interactions among species and alter physical conditions, contributing to changes at the community and population level. For example, the combined effect of ice‐cover duration and terrestrial energy inputs to freshwater environments are major drivers of climate on interspecific interactions among fish in lakes (Ulvan, Finstad, Ugedal, &amp; Berg, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0192" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Specifically, the presence of Arctic charr reduces body growth of brown trout, and these effects are stronger in lakes with high carbon inputs and during periods of ice‐cover than ice‐free summer periods (Ulvan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0192" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Increases to productivity in subarctic lakes also reduce the prevalence of marine migrations by anadromous Arctic charr (Finstad &amp; Hein, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), potentially contributing to northward changes in their distribution. While eutrophication contributes to increased productivity for food webs (resulting in increased fish biomass), hypereutrophication leads to a decline in dissolved oxygen and the production of toxic and unusable phytoplankton, both contributing to fish kills (Jacobson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Smith, Tilman, &amp; Nekola, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) and biodiversity loss (Herb et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Jankowski, Schindler, &amp; Lisi, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Tammi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0185" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). This is especially severe in shallow subarctic lakes, which are covered by ice for 6–8 months each year; increased oxygen demand during this period will greatly increase the likelihood of fish kills. Therefore, the effects of climate change on ecosystem productivity and associated hydrological regimes will be inconsistent due to the terrestrial–aquatic interactions between within these ecosystems.
