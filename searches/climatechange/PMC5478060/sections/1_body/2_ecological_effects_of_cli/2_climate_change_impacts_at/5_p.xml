<p class="p">Increased nutrient input from the terrestrial zone to subarctic freshwaters will alter water clarity, therefore impacting the visual‐feeding and foraging performance of subarctic freshwater fish that are predominantly visual feeders requiring high water clarity to see and capture prey (Confer et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0140" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In contrast to cold‐water species (e.g., salmonids), many cool‐ (e.g., percids) and warm‐water species potentially invading subarctic freshwater (e.g., cyprinids) are adapted to foraging in turbid conditions (Confer et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0138" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>) and therefore are not disadvantaged by reduced water clarity. Greater prey density with increased water temperature may (partially) counteract effects of decreased water clarity on feeding success (Hayden, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>). However, the combined effect of increased water temperature and reduced clarity is predicted to decrease illuminated foraging habitat availability for subarctic fish, thereby reducing body growth (Herb, Johnson, Jacobson, &amp; Stefan,
