<p class="p">Climate has a strong effect on fish habitat use due to the influence of water temperature and habitat volume. During periods of high water temperatures and low discharge in the main channels of rivers, Atlantic salmon preferentially occupy small groundwater‐fed tributaries as cool habitat refugia (Cunjak, Linnansaari, &amp; Caissie, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Use of thermal refugia by fish also occurs in thermally stratified lakes, where cold‐water species occupy patches with discharge of cold water from groundwater zones (e.g., Snucins &amp; Gunn, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0180" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>) or the colder hypolimnetic zone (Lehtonen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). However, oxygen deficiencies caused by increased nutrient inputs and productivity can restrict the potential for the hypolimnion zone of lakes to function as a thermal refuge for cold‐water species. Such processes may lead to local extirpations if local oxygen concentrations decline beyond the aerobic scope of species (e.g., Herb et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Keskinen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0203" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Loss of thermal refuges may also occur due to effects of strong winds on breakdown of thermal stratification, which is expected in small, shallow lakes (Kernan, Battarbee, &amp; Moss,
