<p class="p">Climate change may lead to an intensification of trophic interactions between individuals. Behavior traits such as foraging technique and aggression are related to metabolic activity and growth, both of which are positively correlated with ambient temperature (Lahti, Huuskonen, Laurila, &amp; Piironen,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Thus, feeding performance among individuals is influenced by the interaction of temperature, visual conditions, competitor density, ontogeny, and prey availability. As each of these variables is related to a consumers’ environment, individual‐level responses to climate change will likely be complex and relate to each individual's physiological adaptations.
