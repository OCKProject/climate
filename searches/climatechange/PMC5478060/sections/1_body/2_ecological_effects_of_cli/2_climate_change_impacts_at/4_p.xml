<p class="p">Fish body growth rates are influenced by environmental factors beyond temperature and also mediated by effects of climate change at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. In Norwegian streams, for example, brown trout body growth decreases with increasing population density (suggesting prey availability is a primary determinant of growth) (Bærum, Haugen, Kiffney, Moland Olsen, &amp; Vøllestad, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, increasing water temperature in summer is suggested to increase prey availability, negating the negative relationship between population density and individual growth (Bærum et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Body growth of sockeye salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus nerka</italic>) is linked with the increased production of zooplankton as prey associated with increasing temperature (Schindler, Rogers, Scheuerell, &amp; Abrey, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0168" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>); however, fish body growth decreases with temperature if prey availability is constant (Hill &amp; Magnuson, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). In addition, the effects of temperature increases on fish body growth vary depending on food availability (Elliott &amp; Hurley, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). For example, in a controlled environment the temperature at which peak energy gain occurs increases when trout were fed increasing proportions of prey fish (Elliott &amp; Hurley, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). In subarctic populations of whitefish (
 <italic class="italic">Coregonus lavaretus</italic>), body growth is positively linked with lake productivity (Hayden, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>), indicating that the combined effects of temperature, nutrient inputs, and productivity in freshwaters likely cause changes in body growth rates across the life span of fish.
