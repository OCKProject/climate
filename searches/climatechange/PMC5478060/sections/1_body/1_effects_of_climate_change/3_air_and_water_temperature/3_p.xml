<p class="p">As water temperature is primarily determined by ambient air temperature and solar radiation (Luoto &amp; Nevalainen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), increasing air temperature is reflected in the temperature of freshwaters. Mean annual water temperatures have increased by 0.3°C per decade during the 20th century in subarctic and arctic regions and comparable alpine streams in the USA (Chapin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Isaak et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, changes in mean annual water temperature are not consistent across all seasons. Water temperatures in winter and spring in northwestern Europe have increased by 0.4°C per decade, yet have not altered significantly in summer and autumn seasons (Elliott &amp; Elliott, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Physical environmental characteristics of lakes and rivers have a strong influence on thermal regimes, whereby large volumes of water (e.g., deep lakes) “dampen” temperature variation when compared to small and shallow habitats (e.g., small streams; Heino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In the absence of changes in runoff, increases in water temperature may decrease the size of habitats via evaporation, potentially resulting in complete disappearance of small lakes and seasonal drying of intermittent streams (Chen, Rowland, Wilson, Altmann, &amp; Brumby, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wrona et al.,
