<p class="p">Global air surface temperatures have (on average) risen by 0.85°C since 1880, exceeding rates experienced in previous centuries (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and these increases are disproportionately higher in northern regions of the Earth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32982-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). For example, mean surface temperatures across Canada increased by 1.2°C during 1948–2005; however, these increases were greatest in western (2–2.2°C) arctic and subarctic regions (Prowse, Furgal, Bonsal, &amp; Edwards, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0157" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Recent temperature increases in Siberia (Russia) are four times greater than global averages (Mokhov, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Predictions of future temperatures indicate that recent historical trends will persist in the remainder of the 21st century and that warming in the subarctic and arctic regions will also continue to exceed global averages (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kjellström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Such predictions are consistent across studies despite variation between model outputs and estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions (Tebaldi, Arblaster, &amp; Knutti,
