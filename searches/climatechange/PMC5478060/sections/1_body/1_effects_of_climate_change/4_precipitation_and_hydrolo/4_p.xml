<p class="p">Discharge of subarctic rivers has increased and is predicted to rise further, with climate change. During the 20th century, total annual discharge increased by 7% among rivers of northern Eurasia (Peterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0156" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Intra‐annual discharge seasonality is also shifting due to earlier thawing of ice and snow. Specifically, a shortening of the winter snow cover period by 30–50 days is predicted to bring the timing of annual flood peaks forward by approximately 20 days in catchments draining into the Arctic Ocean (Dankers &amp; Middelkoop, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Earlier spring thawing of snow and ice are expected to intensify low‐flow conditions and habitat contraction during summer, particularly for small and shallow rivers and lakes (Bouchard et al.,

However, the severity of flow reductions during summer periods also depends on the effects of climate change on seasonal precipitation regimes. For example, rainfall and extreme rainfall events are predicted to shift toward winter periods (Nilsson et al.,
