<p class="p">Subarctic freshwaters experience two contrasting seasons: ice‐free summer and an ice‐covered winter (Hampton et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Increases in water temperature related to climate change are most apparent in terms of changes in the timing and duration of ice cover (e.g., Benson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0202" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Critically, while natural climate oscillations (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation) affect the timing of ice thaw in Northern Hemisphere lakes, they do not conceal progressively earlier dates of thawing during 1855–2004 (Sharma &amp; Magnusson, 2014). For example, lake ice‐cover duration decreased by 0.7–4.3 days per decade in lakes across the subarctic due to both later freeze and earlier ice breakup between 1855 and 2005 (Benson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Analyses of river ice breakup dates in the Torne River (bordering Finland and Sweden) during 1693–2013 determined a trend of earlier ice thaw by 0.66 days per decade during 1867–2013 (compared with 0.30 days per decade during 1693–1866) (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0173" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Such observations are expected to continue in the future, with predictions of reduced duration of winter ice cover by up to 35 days during 2035–2070 when compared with 1960–1991 (Dibike, Prowse, Bonsal, Rham, &amp; Saloranta,
