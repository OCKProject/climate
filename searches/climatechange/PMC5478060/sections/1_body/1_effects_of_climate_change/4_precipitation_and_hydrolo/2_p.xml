<p class="p">Increasing air and water temperatures are expected to alter regional weather patterns, particularly precipitation regimes in subarctic regions (Palmer &amp; Räisänen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0151" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Mean total annual precipitation increased by 16%–25% during 1948–2004 across different climate regions of northern Canada (Prowse et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). However, the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation are predicted to cause significant interannual variation in precipitation (Wu, Handorf, Dethloff, Rinke, &amp; Hu, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0208" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The proportion of precipitation as rainfall (in contrast to snow) is also expected to increase as extreme events, likely resulting in increased severity and “flashiness” of flooding (Nilsson et al.,
