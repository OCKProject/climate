<p class="p">Climate change is altering wind regimes in the subarctic and arctic zones, specifically the frequency of extreme wind events and direction. In the context of climate change, wind regimes in the subarctic and arctic are influenced by the extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0208" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Since 1979, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of high wind events in northern Alaska, USA, associated with the extent and volume of Arctic sea ice influencing prevailing weather conditions (Hinzman et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0208" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Wind is relevant to freshwater environments, particularly standing water bodies. Oxygen and temperature stratification during summer periods limits the productive layer of subarctic lakes, and this stratification can be eliminated by wind turbulence (Hinzman et al.,
