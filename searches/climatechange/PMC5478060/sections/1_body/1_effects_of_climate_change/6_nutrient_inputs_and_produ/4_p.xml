<p class="p">The seasonal timing of organic carbon availability in subarctic freshwaters is expected to be exacerbated by changes in seasonal variation in rain and snowfall. Higher winter snowfall and earlier spring flooding due to warmer temperatures (anticipated with subarctic climate change) contribute to increased nutrient inputs from terrestrial sources (Hinzman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). These mechanisms also cause an earlier seasonal initiation of biofilm growth and therefore may alter the temporal dynamics of production and quality of resources in lotic food webs (Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For example, the nutrient value of biofilm peaks in spring following an increase in temperature, but decreases during reduced summer discharge (Davis et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). These findings emphasize the role climate plays in determining the timing, quantity, and quality of energy for ecosystem‐level processes.
