<p class="p">Both increasing DOC and terrestrial permafrost thawing contribute to the release and input of phosphorous and nitrogen, leading to productivity and eutrophication in previously oligotrophic subarctic freshwaters (Hobbie et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Increased productivity and thermal stratification of deep lakes in northern Alaska since 1975 has led to decreased concentration of hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (Hobbie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Such effects on oxygen availability have significant implications for the persistence and biotic interactions of aquatic biota, therefore contributing to altered species distribution (e.g., Lindholm, Stordal, Moe, Hessen, &amp; Aass,
