<p class="p">Despite the substantial body of research examining past or predicted changes in ecosystem productivity associated with climate change in the subarctic, there has been relatively little work to determine the effects on nutritional quality of basal energy sources and the underlying environmental drivers. However, evidence from other regions suggests that effects for basal energy sources will not only be apparent in terms of gross primary production, but also in terms of nutritional quality of energy sources. In an experimental mesocosm study in northern Germany, Verschoor, Van Dijk, Huisman, and Van Donk (

However, it is unclear how the combination of increased gross primary productivity and decreased nutritional quality affects productivity through aquatic food webs, and if effects of increased CO
