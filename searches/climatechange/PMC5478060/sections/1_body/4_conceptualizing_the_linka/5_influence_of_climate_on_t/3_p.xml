<p class="p">Ecological effects of species invasions vary due to the direct environmental and ecological effects of climate change. This suggests that some invasive species will have more benign ecological effects under future climate scenarios when compared to past or present conditions. For example, northern pike and European perch are two species expanding their range within subarctic regions (Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Hein et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Increased temperature coupled with invasion of northern pie is expected to cause the extirpation of both native brown trout and Arctic charr, particularly in small lakes (Byström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Hein et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Öhlund et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This synergistic effect may be considered a consequence of stronger recruitment of invaders in newly invaded habitats leading to higher population densities, and potentially to stronger competitive interactions. This mechanism would be exacerbated by climate change modifying the habitat to resemble the invaders native range. The growth efficiency of Arctic charr is double that of brown trout in cold, low‐productivity lakes, whereas brown trout are more competitively aggressive in warm, productive lakes, suggesting that competitive interactions between invasive and native species along a gradient of productivity determine the effects of invaders (Finstad et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Ecological impacts of invasive species on native species are positively related with temperature in more temperate systems (Habit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), suggesting that initial impacts of range‐expanding species may be limited and become stronger over time with increasing temperature and growing population sizes.
