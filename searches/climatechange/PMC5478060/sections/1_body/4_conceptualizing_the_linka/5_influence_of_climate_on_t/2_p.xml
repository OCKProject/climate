<p class="p">The impacts of invasive species are well understood, particularly for non‐native freshwater fish introduced via human‐assisted dispersal, and these impacts are apparent across the full spectrum of ecological organization (e.g., Cucherousset &amp; Olden, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Gallardo, Clavero, Sanchez, &amp; Vila, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Simon &amp; Townsend,

 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0187" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, there remains a dearth of empirical evidence to determine whether the impacts of climate change‐mediated invasions are consistent following climate related modification of invaded habitats (Rahel &amp; Olden, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Specifically, are the impacts of invasive species consistent with climate change, or under what situations are the effects of climate change and invasive species synergistic or antagonistic? These considerations are of both ecological and economic importance. For example, if climate change reduces the ecological effects of an invasive species, then the performance of conservation management actions targeting invasive species could be predicted to be less effective when compared to another invader whose effects are synergistic under climate change. We therefore emphasize that the ecological effects of invasive species are considered under the context of different climate change scenarios, and this entails more than simply predicting future distributions of invaders.
