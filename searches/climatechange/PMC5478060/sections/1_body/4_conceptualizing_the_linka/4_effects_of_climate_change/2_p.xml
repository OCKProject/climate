<p class="p">Climate change affects the potential distribution of species and these influences are best known in terms of range expansions of species beyond their natural range (Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Such range expansions occur because climate change alters the physical environmental characteristics of ecosystems, and when these characteristics match those required by a species to occupy and function, that species has the potential to invade and persist in that ecosystem (Moyle &amp; Marchetti, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Species with broad environmental tolerances and plasticity of growth across the life span exhibit high potential to invade previously unoccupied habitats (Britton, Cucherousset, Davies, Godard, &amp; Copp, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Budy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; but see Sax et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0165" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Across reported predictions of the global effect of climate change on freshwater fish, only warm‐water taxa are expected to show range expansions (Comte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), but field evidence from subarctic Europe suggests that both cool‐ and warm‐water species range is expanding (Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, an important caveat to the impacts of invasion is that biological performance of invasive species is not consistent when compared across native and invaded populations (Rypel, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0164" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), therefore contributing to unsuccessful establishment (Zenni &amp; Nuñez, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0209" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>).
