<p class="p">Climate change is predicted to increase the potential for species to invade and expand their distribution northward into subarctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia (e.g., Alofs &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015a</xref>; Prowse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The northern distribution of smallmouth bass is restricted by minimum temperature variables; therefore, climate change may be expected to increase the potential for northward invasion into Canada (Jackson &amp; Mandrak, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0171" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Sportfish, including both smallmouth and largemouth bass, expanded their range northward by 17.9 km per decade across Ontario, Canada (Alofs, Jackson, &amp; Lester, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and these expansions are limited primarily by abiotic factors related to climate at the regional scale (Alofs &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015a</xref>). Body growth rate and population abundance of European perch are positively driven by temperature and ecosystem productivity (Dubois, Gillet, Hilgert, &amp; Balvay, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Linlokken &amp; Hesthagen, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>); increases in these variables with climate change will enhance the further success of subarctic invasion by European perch (Hayden et al.,
