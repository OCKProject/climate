<p class="p">Species invasions due to range expansions are a complex aspect of the impact of climate change for ecosystems because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect (response) of climate change and also a potentially important driver (cause) of ecological change (Dukes &amp; Mooney, 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The invasion process involves three separate components: the attributes of the invading species, biotic characteristics of the potentially invaded site, and the environmental conditions of the site, collectively termed the “invasion triangle” (Perkins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32982-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, once a species establishes following invasion, their subsequent ecological effects may be highly variable as a function of physical and biological factors, but the numbers and characteristics of species in invaded systems could be essential here. Using subarctic freshwater ecosystems as a model, we propose a framework for understanding the factors that influence the process of species invasion due to climate change and the subsequent ecological effects of established invaders (Table
