<p class="p">In addition to tracking extreme weather events leading to hazards, injury and disease surveillance is needed to help public health officials respond efficiently to climate-sensitive health impacts and improve local clinical capacity. Indicators of these health impacts must be relevant to vulnerable populations and/or tropical and subtropical regions. Indicators that have been proposed in the United States
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> and Canada
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> include environmental conditions, morbidity and mortality from injury and disease, vulnerability (e.g., proximity to hazards), mitigation and adaptation efforts, and the policy environment. These are not exhaustive and may require further refinement to be applicable to tropical and subtropical regions.
