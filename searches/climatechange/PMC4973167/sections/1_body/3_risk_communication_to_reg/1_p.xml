<p class="p">Public perceptions of disaster risk are influenced by previous personal experiences with the natural hazard and levels of trust in authorities and experts.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> Failed preparedness and response efforts can damage trust in authorities, rendering individuals less likely to comply with recommendations from these sources in future hazards.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> Thus, sustained, well-planned, and culturally relevant public health responses to climate change impacts are paramount. Maintaining accurate estimations of risk is important (i.e., not overinflating personal risk from hazards, yet providing necessary information) to sustain public trust and engagement.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref> For recurring hazards, risk communication should activate individuals' recall of previous experiences, or indirect experience from witnessing media reports of hazards, when encouraging protective actions. For novel or emerging environmental risks, authorities should provide clear recommendations based on what is known, be transparent about areas of uncertainty, and maintain ongoing communication as information about appropriate protective action becomes available.
