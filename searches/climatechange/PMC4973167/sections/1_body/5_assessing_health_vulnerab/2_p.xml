<p class="p">The Natuzzi study provides the necessary information for localities to plan for the health implications of climate change they are currently experiencing, and will increasingly face in the future. The authors analyze infrastructure challenges and human health vulnerabilities in a Solomon Island city during extreme downpours and subsequent flooding. The study uses a variety of surveillance sources to identify multiple direct impacts of this extreme weather event on public health: acute morbidity and mortality (e.g., blunt force trauma and drowning), subacute infectious disease impacts, influenza-like illness, vector-borne illness, and diarrhea. The authors use a geographic information system (GIS) to map population proximity to flooding risk and health system capacity, linking disparate sources such as census estimates, hospital bed data, and evaluation data from healthcare site visits. GIS technology is well suited to studies of climate change and health, given the close relationship between geographic features and population-level health outcomes. Strengthened surveillance systems and ongoing refinement of GIS analytic techniques will benefit climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.</p>
