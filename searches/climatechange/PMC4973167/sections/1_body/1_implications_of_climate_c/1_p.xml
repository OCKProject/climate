<p class="p">For developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions, infrastructure challenges combine with environmental conditions to increase health-related vulnerabilities to climate change. Industrial and vehicle emissions in hot, humid cities contribute to poor air quality due to smog, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality from respiratory diseases.
