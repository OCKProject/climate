<p class="p">The field of tropical medicine will confront some of the first, most widespread, and most pronounced human health impacts of climate change. Documenting these health outcomes in localized contexts will enable practitioners to target treatment according to health vulnerabilities, highlight regional adaptation needs for public health agencies, and establish evidence of the earliest and mounting health consequences of climate change for policymakers and the public. These data are powerful tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Key public health principles, including prevention and preparedness, risk communication, and surveillance must be mobilized in the context of climate change. Individuals who, by virtue of geography or socioeconomic position, are most vulnerable to the acute consequences of climate change urgently require protection. More broadly, these efforts are crucial to global health interests, and serve as a harbinger of the integral role that the health sector will occupy in climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p>
