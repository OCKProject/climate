 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> shows the current environmentally suitable areas for each target species using the ensemble modelling approach. Overall the model predictions match well with current known distributions. The largest discrepancy between the current known distribution and model predictions occurs for the western species

 <italic class="italic">cordatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cryptocarpa</italic>; high probabilities of occurrence for these species are predicted on the east coast of West Falkland (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), where neither species is currently known to occur. There is also a difference in both southwestern species which have ranges predicted well beyond their current known distributions.
