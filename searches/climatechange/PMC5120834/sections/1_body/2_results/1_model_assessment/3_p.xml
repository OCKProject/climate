<p class="p">For the southwestern species 
 <italic class="italic">Nastanthus falklandicus</italic>, distance to coast, then mean temperature of the coldest quarter have the most influence on all component models, followed by precipitation of the driest quarter and water availability. For 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago moorei</italic> four of the five component models rank mean temperature of the coldest quarter as the most important variable and three out of four agree on distance to coast as of least influence. The best Maxent model for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">moorei</italic> also placed very similar importance (32.5%) on mean temperature of the coldest quarter compared to the other models, however it narrowly ranked distance to coast as the most important variable (32.6%).
