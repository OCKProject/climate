<p class="p">Though there are no currently occupied sites that will remain suitable in the future for upland species, there are potential refugia sites within all three of the major upland ranges of the Falkland Islands: the Hornby Mountains (West Falkland), Hill Cove Mountains (West Falkland) and Wickham Heights (East Falkland). By 2080 suitable areas are predicted for 
 <italic class="italic">Azorella selago</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Nassauvia falklandica</italic> within all three major hill ranges, whilst 
 <italic class="italic">Acaena antarctica</italic> is only predicted to occur within the Hornby Mountains. Notably for 
 <italic class="italic">Nassauvia falklandica</italic>, a species not currently known from East Falkland, modelling predicts suitable environmental conditions in 2080 along two sections of the major hill range on this island, Wickham Heights.
