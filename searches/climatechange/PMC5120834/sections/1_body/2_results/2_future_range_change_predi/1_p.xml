<p class="p">There is agreement across ensemble SDMs for each RCM that there will be a decline in the environmental range for all upland and southwestern species across all time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). For the upland species 
 <italic class="italic">Acaena antarctica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Azorella selago</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Nassauvia falklandica</italic>, range contractions of 98%, 97% and 93%, respectively, are predicted by 2080 in relation to their current potential ranges. In addition Wilcoxon rank-sum significance tests (using the five RCM results as replicates) between 2020 and 2080 show decreases of 95% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.045], 93% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.008] and 89% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.008] for the same species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>); this indicates that the current ranges for these species will be almost completely lost by 2080. The decline in upland speciesâ€™ predicted environmental ranges is caused by range contraction rather than range shift (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) leading to overlap figures of only 3%, 2% and 3% for 
 <italic class="italic">Acaena antarctica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Azorella selago</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Nassauvia falklandic</italic> by 2080, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167026.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The majority of areas that satisfy the environmental niches required for these upland species are predicted to be lost by 2080, with declines in the mean percentage suitability across the Islands between 2020 and 2080 of 96% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.036], 94% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.008] and 88% [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.008] for 
 <italic class="italic">Acaena antarctica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Azorella selago</italic> and
