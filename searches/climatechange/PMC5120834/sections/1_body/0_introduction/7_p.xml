<p class="p">This is the first investigation into the likely impacts of climate change on plant distributions in the Falkland Islands. We produced species distribution models to predict potential range shifts. We avoided the tendency to apply climate models to all species without regard for whether this application makes logical sense; without knowledge of the physiological tolerances of all potential target species the application of climate models was therefore only appropriate for the subset of species modelled in this study, where there was a clear correlation between distribution and temperature gradients.</p>
