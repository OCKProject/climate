<p class="p">Due to its position between the Antarctic and South American continents, the Falkland Islands contain plant species at the eastern and southern limits of their distribution, therefore likely to include climate change indicator species and unique genetic variation which is important to conserve in the face of changing climates and other threats [

An understanding of how the risks associated with climate change will impact on the most vulnerable elements of the flora is urgently needed for effective management of the Falklandsâ€™ National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and 17 recently identified Important Plant Areas (IPAs) [
