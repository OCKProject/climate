<p class="p">Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to make predictions about the likely impacts of climate change on speciesâ€™ ranges [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and as such provide a basis for conservation planning decisions. A modelling approach can also direct further research into fundamental plant biology in understudied areas such as the Falkland Islands by providing testable hypotheses [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In the present study we aimed, where possible, to improve the ecological relevance of the component models by incorporating non-climate variables (e.g. water availability, surface geology) that can act as proxies for access to a range of resources at local scales [
