<p class="p">The Falkland Islands has a relatively small native flora of 180 plant taxa (excluding one hybrid) including 14 endemic species [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The size of the flora suggests there is potentially little room for redundancy, increasing the importance of understanding which taxa are likely to be most at risk from the threats posed by climate change. Linking our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on these vulnerable islands floras to policy recommendations is a critical element to ensure long-term conservation. The Aichi Biodiversity Targets recognise this at a global scale and provide a framework for policy action [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The Falkland Islands Government have developed a keen interest in how climate change might impact the Islandsâ€™ species, habitats and the ecosystems services they provide and are updating their Biodiversity Strategy accordingly [
