<p class="p">This study is timely because it is only recently that regional climate models (RCMs) have been available [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and employed to make the first predictions for warming across the Falkland Islands. The Falkland Islands Government is keen to explore useful adaptation and mitigation strategies based on scientific evidence [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The last century has seen a 0.5°C increase in annual mean temperature for Stanley, East Falkland [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. RCMs predict a large increase in the rate of change, with a 1.8 (± 0.34 S.D)°C rise in the mean annual maximum temperature predicted by 2080 [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This prediction is based on the A1B emissions scenario, selected because it places a balanced emphasis on all energy sources [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The prediction is in line with those made for the A1B emission scenario by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project multi-model ensemble, which projects increases of 2 to 2.5°C over much of Argentina [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In contrast little or no change is predicted for the daily temperature range (DTR; Tmax-Tmin) or annual precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], although there is currently less agreement across models for changes in precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] as this variable is more challenging to predict.
