<p class="p">We used these presence-absence maps to derive the predicted present day and future environmentally suitable area. Three range size variables were calculated: % change in environmentally suitable area, % overlap in environmentally suitable area and % change in mean environmental suitability (described below and following the methodology of Cabrelli et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]). Significance testing was carried out where there were different climate values from multiple RCMs (and therefore not possible using present day data). The aim was to determine whether variation between RCMs influenced model predictions. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for significant differences between 2020 and 2080 data.
