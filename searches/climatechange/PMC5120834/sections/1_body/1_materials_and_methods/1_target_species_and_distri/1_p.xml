<p class="p">Our study area comprised the whole of the Falkland Islands archipelago. Given that the climate change predictions for the Falkland Islands are for increased mean annual temperature and no change in mean annual precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], only species with geographically restricted ranges (identified from Upson and Lewis [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]) that represent archipelago-wide variation in seasonal temperatures (identified from Jones et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]) were appropriate for species distribution modelling to investigate climate change impacts. We omitted species that had fewer than 15 records from the modelling work after finding that these gave poor results; low sample sizes have been shown elsewhere to limit model accuracy [
