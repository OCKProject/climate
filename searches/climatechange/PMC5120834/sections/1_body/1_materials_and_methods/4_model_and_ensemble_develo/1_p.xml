<p class="p">We used five modelling algorithms to determine the current environmental ranges of each species, using a resolution of 100 m and a geographical extent covering the entire Falkland Islands. General linear models (GLM), general additive models (GAM), generalised boosting models (GBM), Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt), were all produced using the R statistical package BIOMOD2 [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The species data comprised presence records plus randomly generated data points (referred to as pseudo-absences), so that the latter were 10 times the former in number. The pseudo-absences cover all available environmental space across the Falkland Islands and therefore a small proportion may in theory include environmental conditions that are also suitable for the target species [
