<p class="p">A range of techniques were employed within BIOMOD2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] to assess the predictive performance of each model [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], however assessments of all models primarily considered the True Skill Statistic (TSS) [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] measure. This is because it retains the advantages of Kappa by accounting for both sensitivity and specificity and has been shown to be independent of prevalence, an inherent problem with Kappa statistics [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Final models, incorporating all the available data points [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], were used to generate maps of the overall modelled areas. By convention, an algorithm is considered excellent if the average TSS/ Kappa score across all model replicates is &gt;0.8 and good if 0.6â€“0.8. For each species only those models with an average TSS score above 0.7 were included in ensemble-model building. The ensemble process undertaken within the BIOMOD2 framework, produced ensemble forecast maps for each species that were based on weighted means and covered the whole of the Falkland Islands. We used TSS scores for final target species ensemble model assessment (
