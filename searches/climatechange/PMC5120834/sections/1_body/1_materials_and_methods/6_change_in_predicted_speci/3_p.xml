<p class="p">To calculate the percentage change in overall environmental suitability we followed the method outlined by [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]; using the non-thresholded current and future maps, we calculated the mean environmental suitability for our study area, the entire Falkland Islands, for each time period. These values were used as a measure of environmental suitability for each time period. The change from the present to each time period was expressed as a percentage so that a percentage change of less than 100% is indicative of a decrease in environmental suitability over time (indicating a high vulnerability for the species to climate change) whereas a change greater than 100% indicates increased environmental suitability (low vulnerability of the species to climate change).
