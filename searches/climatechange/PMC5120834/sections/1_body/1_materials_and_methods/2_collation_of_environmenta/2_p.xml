<p class="p">Interpolated climate surfaces for the Falkland Islands were provided by CRU UEA [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and processed by the RBG Kew Geographic Information Systems (GIS) team (
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These were then standardised (for both geographic projection and cell size) and processed by both UEA and RBG to produce future climate scenarios of these areas for the periods 2011–2040, 2041–2070 and 2071–2100; we refer to these time periods using the years 2020, 2050 and 2080.
