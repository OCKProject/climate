<p class="p">Sampling bias was reduced by randomly removing all but a single record from each 100 m grid square across the sampled area; this was carried out using the dismo package [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] in R (version 3.0.2) [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The sampling for all variables (
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was carried out at 100 m, the resolution of the finest-scale topographic variables.
