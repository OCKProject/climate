<p class="p">We used ArcGIS 10.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] to generate five non-climate variables from 90 m resolution NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation data processed by CGIAR-CSI [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The variables produced were selected to represent resource availability and topographical features that may help define a given speciesâ€™ ecological niche. 
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarises the non-climate variables considered for inclusion in each distribution model. Elevation itself was not used as it was strongly correlated with the bioclimatic variables.
