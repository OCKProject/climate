<p class="p">The relative effectiveness of the current legally protected areas, National Nature Reserves (NNR), for plant conservation, in the face of climate change, was assessed against that of identified Important Plant Areas (IPAs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. We compared the presence-absence maps with GIS layers of the NNRs and IPAs and calculated the percentage change in the number of environmentally suitable grid cells that fell within these conservation areas for each of the future maps for each species. This analysis was carried out solely on those species predicted to be at risk of extinction, i.e. we did not do this for western target species.
