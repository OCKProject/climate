<p class="p">We identified species that showed a decrease, by 2080, in the number of environmentally suitable grid cells overlapping with conservation areas. For these species presence-absence maps were used to identify potential refugia sites, i.e. sites that are predicted to remain or become environmentally suitable for each species by 2080.</p>
