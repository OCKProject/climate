<p class="p">We inspected our dataset both visually (e.g. through plotting data as boxplots, histograms and regression lines) as well as via relevant statistical analyses. If two variables were highly correlated (r &gt; 0.7 or &lt; -0.7, Pearson product-moment correlations) we kept the predictor which is highlighted in the literature and/ or known through expert opinion to be ecologically important to a species. We then used the automatic step-wise approach (applied to a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution) using the R function 
 <monospace class="monospace">step()</monospace> and assessed the model quality based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value. Following the 10:1 (data points: number of variables) rule of thumb [
