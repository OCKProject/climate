<p class="p">Considering sites where these particularly sensitive species currently grow, “every effort should be made to minimize other stressors on population viability and to monitor population trends” [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. A re-assessment of current management practices across these and potential long term upland refugia sites would enable an assessment of where threats are likely to be causing unnecessary additional stress to vulnerable communities. In the context of the majority of land in the Falkland Islands being privately owned and used for livestock grazing, a first stage could be the identification and prioritisation of assessments of upland sites that are government owned, currently ungrazed or of low grazing potential but of high value in terms of their potential to act as refugia for vulnerable upland species. Such management considerations are particularly pressing on isolated Islands such as the Falkland Islands where appropriate sites are limited.
