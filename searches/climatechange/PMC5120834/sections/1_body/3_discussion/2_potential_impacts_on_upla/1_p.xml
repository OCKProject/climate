<p class="p">All model outputs agree that the present day ‘upland environmental niche’ is predicted to decrease and that this is likely to have a significantly negative impact on species restricted to these areas across the Falklands. This is directly related to predicted temperature increases and therefore migration to higher altitudes may be the only option for survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Potential upland refugia sites are identifiable however it is important to note that those predicted to remain suitable in the long term do not currently hold populations of target species. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Nassuavia falklandica</italic> is known only from West Falkland but the highest point on the Islands, on East Falkland, is predicted to be one of the locations best able to maintain suitable environmental conditions for this species. With limited available sites, consideration should therefore be given early on to translocation experiments and the role of assisted migration [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. To allow this and other potential management options to be investigated, seed collecting and banking efforts should be expanded alongside the production of horticultural protocols to better understand upland species’ growth requirements and preferences.
