<p class="p">A greater understanding of the ecology of vulnerable species is necessary to better inform management decisions and continue to refine model predictions. Considering the target upland species investigated here, there have been no previous studies into the ecology of

 <italic class="italic">Nassauvia falklandica</italic> [

 <italic class="italic">Azorella selago</italic> at its sub-Antarctic locations indicates a sensitivity to drought and competition from faster growing species [

 <italic class="italic">selago</italic> is largely confined to upland sloped sites with reasonable drainage and those experiencing lower temperaturesâ€”mean temperature of the warmest quarter and water availability drive its distribution in the models presented here. Similar to the current study, this cushion plant is predicted to move up altitudinal gradients in response to warming on sub-Antarctic Marion Island, where it is a keystone species [
