 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] suggest that small increases in temperature in the Falklands may quickly lead to decreased soil moisture leading to ‘more stressful conditions for plants’–in the case of the open grassland community this led (in addition to a dry summer the year before) to a decrease in total vegetation cover and the loss of two species. An expansion of experimental sites to habitats that contain particularly vulnerable species (such as upland cushion heath) is urgently needed.
