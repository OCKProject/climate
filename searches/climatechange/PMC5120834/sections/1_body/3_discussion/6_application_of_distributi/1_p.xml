<p class="p">Our research allows appropriate selection of sites across local temperature gradients for the establishment of both observational and experimental studies. An integrated approach at the outset would help to address the limitations associated with each method, with observational data allowing us to verify experimental results (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]) and experiments helping to improve our mechanistic understanding of responses to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Future sites should focus on altitudinal and East-West temperature gradients across the archipelago and address questions regarding both target speciesâ€™ and community responses to climate change. Plant species respond in different ways to environmental change and hence climate change can alter community composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Long term observational data gathered from altitudinal transects can, for example, monitor whether upland cushion heath habitats (that include target upland species) are vulnerable to encroachment by grassland as observed on Marion Island [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] and therefore potentially inform management decisions of key sites. Appropriately selected sites covering the temperature gradient from East to West Falkland could investigate predictions made with regard to species range expansions or contractions.
