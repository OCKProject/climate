<p class="p">Modelling of two southwestern endemic species 
 <italic class="italic">Nastanthus falklandicus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">moorei</italic> indicate a more extreme response to the predicted temperature increase by the latter, owing perhaps to their limited distribution. The incorporation of soil data may improve predictions for these species in particular as they are largely restricted to sandy, well-drained soils and open habitats with a saline influence [
 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Predictions for 
 <italic class="italic">Nastanthus falklandicus</italic> indicate that almost half of the sites where it currently grows are likely to remain environmentally suitable in the long termâ€”this is encouraging but does not take into account current additional stresses placed on these sites such as high levels of erosion that may be exacerbated from livestock impacts. This again highlights the need to review the management of key biodiversity sites across the Islands and work towards implementing the most sustainable practices to maximise the chances of plants being able to track climate change.
