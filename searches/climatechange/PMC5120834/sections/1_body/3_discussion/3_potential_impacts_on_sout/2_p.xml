 <italic class="italic">cryptocarpa</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">cordatum</italic>, are predicted to experience an expansion in suitable environmental space to varying degrees, owing to their current preference for areas with a milder climate, including higher mean annual temperatures and higher temperatures in the coldest quarter. Vulnerability to frost during the main growing season should be investigated as this may play an important part in explaining their current westerly distributions and restriction to lower altitudes, but it is clear that research into physiological tolerances of the flora of the Falkland Islands is urgently needed to better understand the possible short and medium term responses to climate change. In general there is a greater need for fundamental research into the basic biology, such as germination requirements, of the species that form this unique flora.
