<p class="p">We looked at the predicted future overlap between conservation areas and target speciesâ€™ ranges for both NNRs and IPAs because the former are legally protected, but the majority were not selected with plant conservation in mind. In contrast, Important Plant Areas have been specifically identified to capture the most important areas for plants across the Islands [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Our results clearly show the usefulness of recognising IPAs as vital to long term conservation of threatened plant species in the face of climate change but also highlight areas that should be considered for addition to the network as potential refugia from a changing climate. The effectiveness of IPA networks ultimately depends on how sites are used with respect to current and future management options. The Protected Area network in the Falkland Islands is currently under review and the potential impacts of climate change are high on the list of factors being considered in evaluating the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the Falkland Islands [
