<p class="p">Despite this, areas predicted to be suitable under the current climate include sites where species do not presently occur. This is particularly apparent for 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cordatum</italic> and the southwestern species. This could be for a number of reasons; the sites may be unsuitable due to other variables that could not have been included in the current models (such as soil type); or perhaps they once were present and now are not as a result of deleterious management practices [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. As further information on edaphic factors, such as soil type, become available these should be included into models and tests carried out to assess any reduction in false positives. In addition predicted range changes are based on modelled changes in environmentally suitable space and therefore actual range changes will be impacted by additional factors including dispersal ability and competitive advantage at new proposed suitable sites.
