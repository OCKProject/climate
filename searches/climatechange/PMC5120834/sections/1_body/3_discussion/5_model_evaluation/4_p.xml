<p class="p">We are aware that our modelling is limited by data availability and that additional variables, such as mapped soil types, may have been useful for better characterising each speciesâ€™ ecological niche. Additionally confounding effects may come from the differing management histories across the Islands, in particular in relation to grazing levels. An increase in the number of weather stations and better representation of inland sites would also improve the climate surface maps [
