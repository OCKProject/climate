<p class="p">Our results demonstrate the vulnerability of a remote oceanic island to climate change impacts, showing for the first time that significant range shifts are predicted amongst the native flora of the Falkland Islands under the predicted warming. Our results highlight in particular the vulnerability of a suite of species from upland and coastal areas of the Falkland Islands, implying the need for management strategies that do not place additional stresses on these landscapes. Similar to other South Atlantic islands [

 <xref rid="pone.0167026.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], the Falklands hold a relatively small flora with likely lower levels of diversity amongst plant functional groups and therefore lower levels of redundancy within its ecosystems. It may as a result be inherently more vulnerable to environmental change than mainland areas and islands with higher diversity. Retaining maximum plant diversity is therefore vital to ensuring maintenance of plant functional diversity with this in turn promoting increased resilience to the effects of climate change [
