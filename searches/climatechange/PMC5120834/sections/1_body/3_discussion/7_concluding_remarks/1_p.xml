<p class="p">We have shown that with careful selection of target species, distribution modelling can provide invaluable insights into the likely impacts of climate change on speciesâ€™ ranges across isolated oceanic islands. Moreover our results provide the means to select appropriate places for vegetation monitoring. Combining an expansion of artificial warming experiments with such observational studies across natural gradients would deepen our understanding of the likely impacts of climate change. This approach and the emerging results from this study are of wider application to other UK Overseas Territories as well as other Small Island Developing States who are facing similar challenges in conserving their biodiversity and meeting their agreed commitments to multi-lateral environments agreements.</p>
