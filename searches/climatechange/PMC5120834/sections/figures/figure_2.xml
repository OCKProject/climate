  <title class="title">Target species’ present day environmentally suitable space and predicted changes in short, medium, long term.</title>
  <p class="p">In relation to the present day, predictions are shown for the mean (± 1 S.E) percentage by which the environmentally suitable area available changes (negative values correspond to a range reduction, positive to an expansion), percentage overlap in environmentally suitable area and percentage change in mean environmental suitability; changes are calculated for the short (2020), medium (2050) and long term (2080). Mean values calculated for each species across the five RCMs used. It is worth noting that % overlap in suitable environmental space would be 100% for the present day. For changes in environmentally suitable area available a value of &lt; 100%, 100% or &gt; 100% corresponds to a decrease, no alteration or increase.</p>
