<p class="p">The floristic changes represented by the linear trends in abundance for individual genera are generally consistent with the functional changes observed. There have been notable increases in the relative abundance of the dry‐affiliated genera 
 <italic class="italic">Bertholletia</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Brosimum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudolmedia</italic>, together with sharp decreases for the wet‐affiliated 
 <italic class="italic">Aparisthmium</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Fusaea, Inga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mezilaurus</italic>. Some large‐statured genera have increased significantly, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Mora, Couratari</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eschweilera</italic>. A decrease in smaller‐statured taxa, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Ouratea, Aniba, Marlierea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Astrocaryum</italic> is also observed (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S12</xref>). Palms (Arecaceae) have significantly declined in abundance (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S12</xref>) overall, with marked declines of 
 <italic class="italic">Oenocarpus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Astrocaryum</italic>, even though the hyperdominant palm genus 
 <italic class="italic">Euterpe</italic> has significantly increased in abundance across the basin.
