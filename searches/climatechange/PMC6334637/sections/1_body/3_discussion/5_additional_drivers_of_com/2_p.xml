 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), are likely to gain a greater competitive advantage (Falster &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Although further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis, our results show an increase in basal area of large‐statured taxa (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S10</xref>), both consistent with the expectations from increased competition. Additionally, the relative increase of larger genera is also observed in the broader dataset including the fringes of Amazonia (

 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary material</xref>), which supports the inference of a ubiquitous driver of compositional change. Our observations are also in line with a series of stand‐level studies that show increases in above‐ground biomass, growth, mortality and recruitment across Amazonia—all trends expected as an outcome from increased atmospheric CO
