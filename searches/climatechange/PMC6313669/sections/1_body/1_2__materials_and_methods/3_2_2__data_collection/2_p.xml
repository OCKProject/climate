Example questions included “whether climate change is controllable” and “whether climate change is bad for human health”. Respondents were asked to rate their opinions on a six point Likert scale without a neutral midpoint. Such an approach was recommended by Maibach et al. to better capture the inclination of the participants [

These 12 aspects of problems have been widely accepted as potential important health impacts of climate change [
