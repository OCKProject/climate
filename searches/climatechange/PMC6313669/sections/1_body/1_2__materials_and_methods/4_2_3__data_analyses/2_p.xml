<p class="p">The ability of respondents to identify the health impacts of climate change was assessed using the percentage of correct answers related to the 12 listed problems, which was further categorized into high (≥50%) and low (&lt;50%) levels. We also calculated a summed score (0–12), reflecting the total number of problems that were correctly identified by the respondents. This served as an indication of the overall ability of an individual to identify climate change related health problems.</p>
