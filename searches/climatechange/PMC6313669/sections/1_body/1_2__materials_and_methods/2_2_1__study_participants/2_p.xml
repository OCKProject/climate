<p class="p">A multistage stratified cluster sampling method was adopted to recruit participants. China has been officially divided into five geographic regions. One university in each region was identified: Harbin Medical University in the north, Sichuan University in the west, Sun Yat-sen University in the south, Fujian Medical University in the east, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology in the central region. We estimated that a minimal sample size of 250 from each participating university would be able to meet the requirements of sub-group statistical tests and regression analyses: 110 in clinical medicine; 80 in public health; and, 60 in nursing in line with the proportion of enrolled students for each degree program. Students in these participating universities studied in groups from beginning to completion, each comprising 30â€“40 members. These groups formed the basic unit for sampling. We randomly selected two or three groups of students for each major in each participating university and invited all of the group members to participate in the survey.</p>
