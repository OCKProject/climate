<p class="p">Medical, public health, and nursing students in China are highly aware of the negative impacts of climate change; but, it is evident that they have poor knowledge about the causes of climate change. The students are able to recognize the direct links between weather events and health; but, they are less likely to be able to understand the consequences of climate change involving complicated pathways. A higher level of knowledge on the causes of climate change is a predictor of increased awareness on the negative impacts of climate change; but, the ability to recognize health consequences of climate change is not associated with knowledge on the causes of climate change. Although a good understanding on the causes of climate change by itself is important, it is not enough to get health professionals prepared to cope with climate change consequences. Training and research into the underlying mechanisms of health impacts of climate change needs to be strengthened.</p>
