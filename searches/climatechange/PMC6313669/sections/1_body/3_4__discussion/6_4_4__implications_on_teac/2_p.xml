It is evident from this study that the students lack a global and systems view on health impacts of climate change despite high awareness of the negative impacts of climate change. They have difficulties in recognizing health problems that are indirectly linked to climate change through more complex pathways, including those that are associated with population displacement and changing ecosystems. In the literature, there have been discussions about how to reinforce knowledge on the interaction between climate change and human health in medical education [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. However, such education programs have to adopt a global view. It is not ethical for health professionals to constrain services to the concerns of their local patients only, and ignore the broader problems that are experienced by those from the “other parts of the world” as a result of climate change [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Meanwhile, teaching into climate change has to be meaningful and bear close connections with the reality the health professionals are facing [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. China is not a migrant country. The concept of climate refugee may sound alien to many health professionals in China. However, the recent transition of China’s economy has witnessed dramatic growth in population movements (e.g., rural-to-urban and region-to-region migrations) and changes in ecosystems (e.g., the three gorges dam). In recent years, China has also accelerated its international health assistance activities to other countries. As a result, health professionals in China have been increasingly exposed to many health challenges that are similar to some of the problems resulting from climate change. It would be a reasonable choice to combine the considerations of development and climate change in teaching deliveries [
