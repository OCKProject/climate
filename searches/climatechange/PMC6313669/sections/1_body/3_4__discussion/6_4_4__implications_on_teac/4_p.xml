<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first national study to explore the knowledge and perceptions on climate change of medical, public health and nursing students in China. Similar studies are also limited in the international literature. There are some limitations in this study. The study instrument was developed based on the few available literature. The reliability and validity of the instrument are subject to further scrutiny. The study adopted a cross-sectional design. No causal relationships can be drawn from the results. In addition, perceptions can be shaped by many factors, including culture, values and religious belief, just to name a few. Unfortunately, many of these data were either unavailable or hard to measure due to a lack of reliable measurement instruments. Furthermore, this study was undertaken in China. Precautions should be taken in attempts to generalize the findings to other countries. However, Chinaâ€™s medical education system has borrowed experiences from many other countries. It has become increasingly aligned with international standards. Lobell et al. point out that Asia and Africa are likely to suffer similar problems due to the same likelihood of large food-insecure human populations [

There is also a need to develop a more comprehensive instrument to assess competencies of health professionals in dealing with climate change and its health impacts.
