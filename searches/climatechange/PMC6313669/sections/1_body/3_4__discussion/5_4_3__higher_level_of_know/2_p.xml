<p class="p">However, knowledge on the causes of climate change by itself is not enough to enhance the skills of medical, public health, and nursing students in recognizing and mitigating health harms resulting from climate change. We found that knowledge on the causes of climate change is not associated with the ability of the students to recognize climate change related health problems. Kahan and colleagues [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] concluded that causal knowledge can lead to skill gains, but only under certain conditions. Hagmayer and Witteman proposed a Causal-explanation-based Decision Making (CDM) framework, which describes when and how causal knowledge and reasoning should be used in decision making for better outcomes [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. They pointed out that the CDM framework aligns well with the clinical reasoning of health professionals. It is important to note that the causal knowledge about climate change measured in this study does not entail understandings about the underlining mechanisms of the potential health impacts of climate change. Our limited understanding on these mechanisms may jeopardize the effect of the causal knowledge on the skill gains of the students in recognizing climate change related health problem.
