 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] explored the impacts of environmental education on the environmental knowledge, attitudes, and “greening” daily activities of high school and university students, and found out that the focus of environmental education is essential in shaping the attitudes of the students toward sustainable consumptions. But it remains a great challenge in developing proper strategies for priming medical students into a “medical mode” that can alter their opinions on the scientific merit of nonmedical issues [

Without proper education, they may hold naïve awareness of the potential impact of individual contributions and feel disempowered for actively engaging in sustainability efforts [
