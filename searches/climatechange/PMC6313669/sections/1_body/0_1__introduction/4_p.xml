 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Climate-relevant knowledge appeared important for the publicâ€™s willingness to change behaviors and to accept climate change policies [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, not all dimensions of knowledge are equally influential. Knowledge about the causes of climate change is perhaps the most powerful driver of concerns about and actions on climate change, although it has been subject to serious debates over the past few decades in the public and political arenas [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A cross-country survey conducted by Shi and colleagues revealed that a higher level of concerns from the general public on climate change is associated with their understanding on the causes of climate change [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Bord et al. found that causal knowledge of global warming is associated with beliefs and behavioral intentions about climate change [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Similar results were also found in a study that was conducted by Tobler et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02650" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Based on these findings, Shi and colleagues argued that climate change campaigns should have a strong focus on promoting knowledge about the causes of climate change [
