<p class="p">When considering the use of a citizen-science approach for climate awareness and education, a primary advantage is the past success demonstrated in citizen science. Several ongoing citizen science projects mentioned, including, for example, those of The Cornell Lab (
 <xref rid="b13-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>), have been shown to generate large amounts of scientifically valuable data while educating participants in the process of science and the specific areas of investigation (
 <xref rid="b6-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). In North America alone, there may be more than 200 research projects (

 <xref rid="b53-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>). Although some of these projects have turned into published scholarly works, the field of citizen science as a whole is underdeveloped and seen as an educational opportunity (
 <xref rid="b6-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Additional opportunities exist to evaluate the educational aspects of these projects, as these remain understudied compared with other teaching techniques (
