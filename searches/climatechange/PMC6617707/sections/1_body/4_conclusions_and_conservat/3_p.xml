 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations is a future prospect. Nationwide-scale assessments are expected to help identify the most vulnerable populations and pinpoint candidate areas for assisted migration, as an alternative means of adaptive management. Assisted migration may be the only strategy to prevent the extinction of many montane species, particularly the alpine Rock Ptarmigan that was the focus of the present study, which face habitat loss as suitable climatic conditions migrate upward and off the top of mountain ranges [
