<p id="Par36" class="p">Sub-model A, which predicted the occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> from the area fractions of three alpine vegetation communities and distance from the ridgeline, showed reasonably accurate predictability (AUC: 0.97, sensitivity: 0.94, specificity: 0.93, threshold probability for potential habitat: 0.02). The IOV of the explanatory variables ranged from 0.99 to 1.00, which showed that all of the explanatory variables were important to the same extent for the occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>: Table S2). Response curves of the model (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>: Figure S2), which show positive or negative effects on the occurrence probability in the model at plus or minus values of linear predictor, showed that the occurrence probability was higher in areas with high area fractions of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> community and close to the ridgeline. The fellfield community was positively affected when its area fraction was higher than 14.6%, but was negatively affected when the fraction was less than this value. The snowbed grassland community was positively affected in most of the area fractions, but was negatively affected when the fraction was less than 0.7%.
