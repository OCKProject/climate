<p id="Par22" class="p">In the present study, to assess the vulnerability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations and identify sites for conservation planning under future climate change, changes in the potential habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> were predicted using an SDM, which describes how the alpine ecosystems interact with 24 future climate simulations. The results are expected to identify sustainable and vulnerable habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> in the study area, which could be integrated into the conservation planning for the species under future climate change.
