 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Several ecological phenomena, including phenological change and advancement of spring events, which are considered to be related to rising temperature, have been detected in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, for animal species, it is difficult to detect signs of climate change impacts using artificial climate change experiments because of their higher mobility. Therefore, quantitative assessments that identify current and future areas of particular conservation concern for populations are required to facilitate adaptive management practices. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been recognized as a useful tool for assessing the impact of environmental change on the distribution of organisms, and for selecting natural ecosystems important for preservation and management [
