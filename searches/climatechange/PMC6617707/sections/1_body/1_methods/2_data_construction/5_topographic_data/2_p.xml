<p id="Par29" class="p">Variation in the cover and height of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> is closely related to the degree of wind exposure and snow depth in high mountains during winter, together with microtopographic change. The height of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> decreases gradually as the degree of wind exposure increases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The degree of wind exposure is higher closer to the ridgeline on the wind-blown slope side in winter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Thus, distance from the ridgeline was measured as the topographic factor that is considered to affect the height of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> community.
