<p id="Par32" class="p">We validated the accuracy of the model by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] based on predicted presence/absence data and the validation data, which was bootstrapped from all of the training data with 100 repetitions. We chose using whole data for modeling and bootstrapped data for validation because we considered development of good model more important than the robustness of validation (although validation results could be slightly overestimated). The AUC ranges from 0.5 for models with no discrimination ability to 1.0 for models with perfect discrimination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. In addition, we calculated model sensitivity and specificity (the proportions of presence and absence data correctly predicted) based on the predicted and actual presence/absence data of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> territories. We defined a threshold value by assigning a cutoff sensitivity (95%), as recommended by Pearson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. The threshold was defined based on model predictions for the entire training data set. We defined areas with probabilities greater than, or equal to, the threshold probability as potential habitat, and areas with probabilities lower than the threshold value as non-habitat.
