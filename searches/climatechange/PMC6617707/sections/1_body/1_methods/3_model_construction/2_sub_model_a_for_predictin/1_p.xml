<p id="Par31" class="p">A generalized additive model (GAM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] was used to predict the potential habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic>. We used the package “mgcv” to construct a GAM in R. Data on the presence and absence of territories for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> were used as a response variable. The area fractions of three alpine vegetation communities in the territories and 300-m grid cells of absent areas were used as explanatory variables, together with distance from the ridge. The three communities used were the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic>, snowbed grassland, and alpine fellfield communities. The number of surveys was included as an offset term, to incorporate the effect of survey effort. The area fraction of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> community was used as a combination term with distance from the ridge, based on the thin plate smoothing spline algorithm (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>: Appendix S2). The relative importance of the variables (IOV) was calculated based on the Akaike weight for all of the models, which was developed by all combinations of explanatory variables [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>].
