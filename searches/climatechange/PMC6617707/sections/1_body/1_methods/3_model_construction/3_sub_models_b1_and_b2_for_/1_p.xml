<p id="Par33" class="p">We developed two sub-models to predict the area fractions of alpine vegetation communities (B1 and B2). In general, plant species distributions are assumed to be controlled by climate at large scales and by non-climatic factors at small scales, including topography, soil conditions, and biotic interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. In the present study, we assumed that climatic conditions control the occurrence of alpine vegetation zones at macro-scales, whereas topographic conditions with climatic suitability control the area fractions of alpine vegetation communities at micro-scales. On the basis of this assumption, we constructed two sub-models by using different explanatory variables at different spatial scales for each sub-model as follows.
