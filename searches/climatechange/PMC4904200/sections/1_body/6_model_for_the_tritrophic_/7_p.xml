<p class="p">Incorporating climatic effects influencing this system is especially important in correctly capturing its evolution in a model. In particular, warm weather immediately after snow thaw and direct exposure to sunlight helps larch foliage thrive during the vegetation period
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. Growth is enhanced by an early, warm springtime, but a late, cool spring retards growth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Short, dry summers and very cold winters are conditions favourable to the larch. Good precipitation is beneficial for both larch and budmoth, although continuous cloud cover hampers larch growth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Increased overall temperatures in the active vegetation period and increased frost do not appear to favour larch growth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Our model, with eight parameters, is the most versatile one available to analyze the system and includes the effect of climate. In general, large values of 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> can be taken to correspond to favourable environmental conditions, and low values to adverse conditions. We can, for example, interpret 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> as a measure of precipitation, and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> as an inverse temperature. If winter temperatures are high, it leads to high egg mortality and hence, low budmoth populations. This important effect of temperature is incorporated in our model through the parameter 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>. Because of the complex relationship between various parameters in the system, a strict interpretation of 
 <italic class="italic">all</italic> high 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> values being uniformly favourable may not, however, be feasible.
