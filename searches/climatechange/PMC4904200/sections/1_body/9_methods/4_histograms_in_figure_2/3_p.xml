<p class="p">It must be mentioned that although we have chosen the parameters to be constant, it is only under the assumption that the effect of the environment on these parameters is negligible. It could well be that there are certain thresholds beyond which these effects may not be negligible. For such scenarios one may have to additionally introduce appropriate equations governing the evolution of the parameters. We have not considered such situations for the sake of simplicity.</p>
