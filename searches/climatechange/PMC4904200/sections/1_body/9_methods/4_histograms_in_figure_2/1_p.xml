 <italic class="italic">h</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> were varied from minimum to maximum values (
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> were varied from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1 and 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> from 1 to 12 in steps of 0.1) to generate the time series and FFT was performed on these.
