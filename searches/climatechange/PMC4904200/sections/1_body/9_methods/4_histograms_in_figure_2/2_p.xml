<p class="p">We have taken for the plant vulnerability a constant value 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.5 for the larch; this could perhaps take a different value for some other tree species. We take a constant value for 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">y</italic>
 </sub> since we do not expect the parasitoid wasting time to change much unless something drastic happens to the parasitoid (such as being sprayed over by some pesticide). Similarly 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">z</italic>
 </sub> related to intra-specific competition is also taken to be constant. Numerically we have checked and verified that 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">z</italic>
 </sub> does not not affect the time period much.
