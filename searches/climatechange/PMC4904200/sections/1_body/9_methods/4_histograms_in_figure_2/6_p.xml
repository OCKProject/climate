<p class="p">Since 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> of our model have not been calibrated with actual measurements from field work, we varied 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> equally in all possible values, discarding those values of 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> that yield no cycles, because they do not represent favourable conditions for cycles or they have not occurred, else there would have been a break in the 1200 year data.
