<p class="p">By incorporating for the first time climate effects in an ecological model bearing memory of past events, we captured the observed consequences of climate change on pest outbreak cycles, resolving the puzzle of the occurence, absence and collapse of larch budmoth cycles. We suggest using bifurcation movies for identifying climatic tipping points; and after careful calibration of climate parameters with observed data, their use for predicting future outbreaks.</p>
