<p class="p">Wasteful feeding by budmoth larvae on larch foliage leading to a scorched appearance of the entire landscape, has prompted several investigations of the population cycles of this insect pest (see for instance ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>). Previous studies on larch budmoth (LBM) population cycles have established the presence of a third trophic level â€“ parasitoids which prey upon budmoth larvae

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. The population densities of the budmoth, the parasitoids preying upon them and needle lengths of the larch
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref> are all known to show periodic cycles which are mutually synchronized. This tritrophic system was first modelled by Turchin
