<p class="p">Tree-ring analysis of larch trees in the Alpine region have shown 123 outbreaks over the past 1200 years. While the predominant periodicity found is of around 9 years, an 8 year cycle has also been observed, and (less frequently) a 10 year cycle, with other periodic outbreaks occurring a fewer number of times
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The last outbreak occurred in 1981 after which the cycles have collapsed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Experiments reported in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> revealed changes in periodicity when the densities of the budmoths were altered by manual removal or spraying of pesticides. Such outbreaks are not seen in the Tatra mountains in the Carpathians. Trees in the Tatra mountain range are at much lower altitudes and are hence exposed to much warmer conditions in comparison to their Alpine counterparts. The presence of a constant cloud cover in the Tatras also exposes these larches to less sunshine, and they are sparser â€“ another distinguishing feature between the Alpine and Tatra larches
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. The absence of budmoth outbreaks in the Tatra region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> as opposed to that in the Alps has been a puzzle thus far and a challenge for modelling the ecological system.
