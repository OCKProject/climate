<p class="p">Histograms of the frequencies of occurrence of the budmoth population cycles from our model and those generated from the budmoth outbreak data available from
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref> are very similar. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> our model is compared with the observed outbreaks reconstructed from tree rings data for a time-span of 1200 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Both histograms show the 9-year cycle as the predominant one followed by 8-year cycle and then a 10-year cycle. Even the relative frequencies are comparable. In ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, a twenty five year cycle was assumed as no outbreak had occurred until then since 1981, and global warming (i.e., bad climatic conditions) was hypothesized as a possible reason for non-occurrence or changed periodicity of the budmoth cycles. However, no outbreak has been reported yet after 1981. Our model predicts that longer periodicities of 40 and 100 year cycles are possible (see Methods). It would be interesting therefore to check for outbreaks 5 years from now (if the 40 year cycle is realized) or if it occurs in 2081 (hence confirming the 100 year cycle). Our model successfully simulates the conditions for both the Alps as well as for Tatra and it could be used to study the system elsewhere in the world too, where the larch is endemic.
