 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1(a,b)</xref> are reminiscent of the Tatra region where larches grow sparser than in the Alps. This leads to high intraspecific competition between the budmoths, or equivalently, low values for 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. Cycles could then be sustained only when climatic conditions are very favourable for growth of the larches (large 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> values) and when the budmoth intrinsic growth rate 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> is very high (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1(a,b)</xref>). The Tatras which are under cloud cover most of the time, receiving lesser sunshine than the Alps, would be characterized by low 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> values and hence would never have cyclic outreaks. Also 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>, known to be strongly influenced by the plant quality index
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> appears to be a distinguishing parameter beteeen the Alps and the Tatras We note that the other parameters are species-specific and can be changed only by long term factors like evolution (or some very drastic change that permanantly changes everything, such as forest fires or some other catastrophe). We have assumed a slow climate change which began towards the end of the last century; our assumption is also consistent with the observations.
