<p class="p">Environmental changes following a climatic tipping point may affect the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, etc., which in turn are reflected in various ways such as changes in the home range of animals, changes in flowering and sprouting times, changes in population cycles, etc. These changed conditions would be manifested as different phenomena in the resulting bifurcation diagrams with respect to the climate parameters. In particular, certain regions of the parameter space would act as repellers while some other regions would act as attractors, respectively creating and annihilating fixed points, changing the periodicity of the system, and taking it to a different state. The new stable equilibrium points would correspond to the new state where the system would now live in after attaining the climatic tipping point, different from the previous state of the system.</p>
