<p class="p">Some of our results depicted through movies of bifurcation diagrams for the climate parameters 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> can be viewed in the Supplementary multimedia files linked to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. As the movies run, varied behaviour is seen: source and sink-like regions (attractors/repellors) are formed, bubble creation and destruction at specific 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> values, different chaotic bands, etc., converging from either side and merging, or getting repelled away from source. These appear to be stability boundaries of basins in the phase space of the system, demarcating regions of differing stability. This suggests that source or sink-like regions seen in the bifurcation movies may be identified with climatic tipping points.
