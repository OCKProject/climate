As expected, high occurrence probability was predominantly predicted for areas resembling climatic characteristics of the South African Cape region with high annual variation in ambient temperatures, comparatively warm and dry summers, and mild and wet winters (

More precisely, probability was correlated with mild winter temperatures (10–20°C), low precipitation during the wettest (&lt;350 mm), and the coldest quarter (&lt;500 mm) and high precipitation during the warmest quarter (400–600 mm) (
