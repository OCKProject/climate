 <xref rid="pone.0154869.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Potentially highly suitable areas cover the south central United States (Texas, Kansas), western (stretching from Peru through Colombia and into Venezuela), eastern (eastern Brazil, stretching along the Paran√° River), and southern South America (north-eastern Argentina). In Europe, particularly high probabilities are predicted in Portugal, eastern Spain, southern France, and Italy. In accordance with Measey

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], both SDM approaches predict only moderate occurrence probability in Great Britain. In addition to the native distribution of

 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> have been reported so far). Moreover, both SDMs predict high suitability in China (Nanzhao plateau, Sichuan, Chinese plain), Japan, and southern Australia. The maximum entropy SDM highlights additional regions with high probabilities in Florida and south-eastern China (Zhejiang Province) (
