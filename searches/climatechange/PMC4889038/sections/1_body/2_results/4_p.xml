 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154869.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). However, the magnitude of decrease varies between RCP scenarios and between SDM approaches. For the maximum entropy SDM, the potentially suitable range size is predicted to decrease by 7 to 13% from RCP 2.5 to RCP 8.5, respectively. This corresponds to a maximum decrease of 1% in relation to the world’s surface area (
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The ensemble SDM predicts a rather moderate decrease of 1 to 10%. Since the areas predicted by the ensemble SDM are generally larger, the portion of the world’s surface area predicted to be suitable shrinks by 3% (
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). A comparison between the full model and the respective probability cut-offs does not reveal significant differences between RCP scenarios (
