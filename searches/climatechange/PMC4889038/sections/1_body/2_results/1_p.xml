<p class="p">Model performance was 0.841 (AUC
 <sub class="sub">test</sub>) and 0.846 (AUC
 <sub class="sub">training</sub>) for the maximum entropy model while weighted means of 0.631 for Cohen’s Kappa, 0.892 for AUC, and 0.685 for TSS were obtained for the ensemble model, demonstrating that both SDMs discriminate moderately well between suitable versus unsuitable space [

Predictor contribution for the maximum entropy model was particularly high for ‘precipitation of the driest quarter’ (27.65%), ‘mean temperature of the wettest quarter’ (16.82%), ‘mean temperature of the coldest quarter’ (14.52%), and ‘precipitation of the warmest quarter’ (11.38%) (

Variables with high contribution in the ensemble model were ‘mean temperature of the coldest quarter’ (19.05%), ‘precipitation of the warmest quarter’ (16.57%), ‘mean temperature of the warmest quarter’ (13.92%), ‘precipitation of the driest quarter’ (12.56%) (
