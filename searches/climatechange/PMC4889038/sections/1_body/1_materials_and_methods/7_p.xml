 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> on a global scale, 11 general circulation models (GCMs: BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, hadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MIROC5, MRI-CGCM3 and NorESM1-M) representing simulations for four representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, RCP8.5) for 2070 were obtained from the fifth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5 WG1 2013;

The selected RCPs represent four possible greenhouse gas emission trajectories ranging from low (RCP2.6) to high (RCP8.5) corresponding to increases in global radiative forcing, from pre-industrial times to 2100. These climate projections were statistically downscaled to match the bioclim variables using the delta method [
