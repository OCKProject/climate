They represent minima, maxima and average values of monthly, quarterly, and annual ambient temperature as well as precipitation recorded between 1950 and 2000. All predictors had a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc min (approx. ~5 km resolution at the equator). Out of the total set of variables a set of nine predictors with pairwise Spearman rank correlation coefficients R
