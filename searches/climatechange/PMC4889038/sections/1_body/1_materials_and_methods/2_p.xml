<p class="p">To prevent over‐fit and false inflation of model performance through spatially auto‐correlated species records [

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], the comprehensive dataset of 1382 records was filtered, and clustered locality records were reduced to a single point within a specified Euclidian distance in environmental space using 
 <italic class="italic">the spatially rarefy occurrence data tool</italic> for the 
 <italic class="italic">ArcGIS SDM toolbox</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. The final dataset used to build SDMs contained 826 records for South Africa, 37 for South America, 24 for North America, and 38 for Europe. SDMs built exclusively on occurrence data from the native range of invasive species tend to underestimate the potential invasive distribution, particularly when projecting onto climate change scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Hence, native and invasive occurrence records were pooled [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] for the computation of SDMs. In this way a maximum amount of information on the species’ realized bioclimatic niche was integrated.
