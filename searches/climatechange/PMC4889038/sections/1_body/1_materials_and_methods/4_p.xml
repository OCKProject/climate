 <italic class="italic">Maxent</italic> is supposed to exhibit a higher predictive performance than more conventional techniques [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] and has successfully been used to model the potential distribution of invasive species and to assess impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Only linear, quadratic and product features were allowed in order to restrict model complexity, while extrapolation was not allowed to reduce uncertainties due to projections onto non-analogous climates [

 <italic class="italic">Maxent</italic> model was trained by randomly splitting the species records into 70% used for model training and 30% for model testing applying a bootstrap approach. The Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] was used to evaluate the discrimination ability of the resulting SDM. Averages across 100 replicates were used for further processing. As the selection of an appropriate background is known to affect model performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], a circular buffer of 250 km around each locality record was selected as training area following Measey
