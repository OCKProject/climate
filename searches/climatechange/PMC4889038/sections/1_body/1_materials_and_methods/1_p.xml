<p class="p">In order to assess the present and future invasion potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic> on a global scale georeferenced occurrence records, covering the species’ native distributional range in South Africa, as well as all known invasive populations in Europe, were obtained from recent literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and supplemented by 286 new records collected during own field research (J.C., J.S., R.R., J.M., F.L., A.dV.). Until recently 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> was considered a species complex with a number of genetically distinct lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] noted that all invasive populations were from the South African ‘Cape’ clade [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] an area including the winter rainfall region and southern coast of South Africa. Since that time, De Busschere 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] determined that the French invasion incorporated lineages from throughout the range of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic>. In addition, recent phylogeographic research supports the recognition of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">petersii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">victorianus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">poweri</italic> as separate species and therefore confines the native range of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis sensu stricto</italic> to southern Africa (South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi) [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The occurrence data set for southern Africa used in this study was adjusted accordingly. It is important to note that this is a novel interpretation of the taxonomy and native range of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> in comparison to that used by Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>].
