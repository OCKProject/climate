<p class="p">In order to quantify impacts of different RCP scenarios onto the global invasion potential of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic>, the following predicted areas were determined: a) the entire SDM area using the ‘minimum training presence’ as threshold, b) the respective MESS area, and c) the SDM area–MESS area. A probability cut-off of 25%, 50%, and 75% onto the ‘SDM area–MESS area’ was applied to assess impacts for different probability classes. Further, the full model was partitioned into estimates for each continent. Subsequently, the invasion potential for 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> was determined on a continental scale as described above. Shift maps were generated to illustrate predicted gains, losses and stability of environmentally suitable space for all climate change scenarios following Bertelsmeier

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Comparisons between the results obtained by our 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent</italic> analyses, the results presented by Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and the results obtained via 
 <italic class="italic">biomod2</italic> were performed by rescaling the probability output and subtracting the potential distribution grids from each other. Rescaling involved subtracting the minimum training presence threshold from each model and computation of percentages per grid cell relative to the maximum probability. The resulting maps quantitatively indicate for each area which SDM shows a higher probability.
