<p class="p">Ensemble SDMs were computed using the

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] for 
 <italic class="italic">Cran R</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] including the following eight algorithms: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Boosting Models (GBM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Factorial Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Maxent, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) applying the same training background as for the 
 <italic class="italic">Maxent</italic> analyses. We applied a bootstrapping approach with 100 replicates randomly subdividing the locality dataset in 70% for model training, whereas the remaining 30% were used for model evaluation using the AUC [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Cohen’s Kappa [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. The average projection across all replicates was used for further processing. The “Minimum training presence” (mtp) referring to the lowest generated probability estimate of the training data [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], was applied as presence-absence threshold. While threshold selection is a potential source for biases, the mtp has been shown to represent a confident method performing well for presence only SDMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] particularly for modelling potential distributions of invasive species [
