<p class="p">The African clawed frog, 
 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic> (Daudin, 1802), is one of the world's most widely distributed amphibians with populations originating from the Cape region in South Africa having become established on four continents (North America, South America, Asia and Europe) due to both accidental escape and voluntary release of laboratory animals [

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. While the establishment of introduced populations was most successful in areas with a Mediterranean climate, which closely resembles the environmental conditions of the Western Cape region, the persistence of several populations in cooler environments for decades suggests a capacity for long-term adaptation [

 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> has been severely underestimated with vast areas being potentially susceptible to invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In addition, it has been claimed that climate change is likely to enhance this species’ invasion potential, favouring range expansion and population growth [
