<p class="p">We hypothesize that rising ambient temperatures associated with climate change will likely increase occurrence probabilities in currently cooler environments e.g. along the present day northern range limits of the species. Thus, climate change will promote the expansion of existing populations and increase the probability of additional invasions in the northern hemisphere, while occurrence probabilities for populations from the southernmost range limits are likely to decrease.</p>
