<p class="p">Future projections of both SDM approaches identify regions that will likely become vulnerable to colonization in response to climate change. With an expected decrease of 1–3% (given as percentage of the worlds’ surface area) the overall magnitude of expected changes appears to be moderate, while the predicted global area suitable for
