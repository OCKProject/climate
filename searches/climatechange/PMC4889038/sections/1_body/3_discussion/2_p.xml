Both SDMs predict only moderate probability for Great Britain, where populations from Wales and Lincolnshire have recently been extirpated [

Furthermore, our results highlight areas in Spain (including the Balearic Islands), mainland Italy (including Sardinia), and southern France (including Corsica) to be highly vulnerable to potential invasions, as these regions exhibit suitable climatic conditions for
