<p class="p">Thus, regional patterns may facilitate new invasions or promote a spread of the established invasive populations, especially in France and Great Britain, where populations persisted for decades [

 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Due to an increased environmental suitability caused by climate change along the northernmost boundaries of the species’ range, chances of successful establishment in Great Britain in case of re-introductions will increase in the future. Climate change is widely considered to exacerbate the impact of invasive species [
