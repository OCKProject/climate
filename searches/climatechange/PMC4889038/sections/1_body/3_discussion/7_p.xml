SDMs represent a quick and cost efficient tool to evaluate the current and future invasion potential of non-indigenous species. In addition, SDMs facilitate the identification of areas with high susceptibility to invasion and help to prioritize management actions. According to our results preventive measures should predominantly focus on the speciesâ€™ northern range limits, particularly north-western Europe to prevent further spread and establishment of new populations as well as a re-introduction in Great Britain.
