<p class="p">Our predictions of the present potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic> generally agree with the findings presented by Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] highlighting analogous spatial extents and geographic locations. Both SDMs reveal large areas that can potentially be colonized on several continents. However, the overlap comparison of our SDMs with the prediction by Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] yields higher probability values on all continents for both our ensemble and our maximum entropy SDM (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154869.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). These differences might be attributed to the different occurrence data sets used. While Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] applied a restricted definition within 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> using only records from a single clade occurring in the winter rainfall zone and southern coast of South Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], the data used in this study was adjusted according to the findings of Furman 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] resulting in a larger coverage for the species native range. Thus, the environmental space covered by the occurrence dataset used was larger than in Measey 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
