<p class="p">Even though considered particularly difficult in Mediterranean areas, eradication of invasive populations of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> has been proposed [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] and an eradication program was established by the Portuguese Governmental Nature Conservation Institute in Oeiras, western Portugal in 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In addition, eradication was successfully executed in Scunthorpe, Humberside area, Great Britain [
 <xref rid="pone.0154869.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. According to our results eradication of established populations of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">laevis</italic> should focus on areas where populations are still small and scattered, but likely to expand in response to climate change e.g. Portugal and Sicily.
