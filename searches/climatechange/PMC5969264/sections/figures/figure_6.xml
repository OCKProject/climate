  <p class="p">Large‐scale fraction of annual mean precipitation from 50°S to 50°N regressed against the (a) convective timescale and (b) entrainment rate for the CAM perturbed parameter ensemble of simulations; blue stars are all simulations and red dots are a subset within a range of entrainment rate values from −1.8 to −1 km
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; (c) annual precipitation amount distributions for simulations with 32 min (dark‐solid) and 103 min (light‐dashed) convective timescales (i.e., the end members of the subset simulations) of total (T, purple), convective (C, red), and large‐scale (L, blue) contributions; and annual precipitation amount distributions of (d) total, (e) convective, (f) and large‐scale contributions from the subset simulations. The units of the amount distributions are shown as mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (as given in the figure title), however they are scaled by ΔlnR
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, where ΔlnR = ΔR/R, which has units of mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and is thus a unitless scaling term.
