  <p class="p">Annual precipitation (a, b) frequency, (c, d) amount, and (e, f) percentile distributions from 50°S to 50°N of present‐day daily rates for CAM at 110 km (dark‐solid) and 28 km (light‐dashed) horizontal resolutions of total (T, purple), convective (C, red), and large‐scale (L, blue) contributions; Figures 4b, 4d, 4f are distributions based on scaling the convective and large‐scale contributions to match the total precipitation amount as described in the text; small plots in Figures 4a, 4b are frequency distributions shown on a linear 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis. The units of the amount distributions Figures 4c, 4d are shown as mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (as given in the figure title), however they are scaled by ΔlnR
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, where ΔlnR = ΔR/R, which has units of mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and is thus a unitless scaling term.
