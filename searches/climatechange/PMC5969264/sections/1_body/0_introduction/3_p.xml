<p class="p">Some recent studies have found an improvement in the representation of rainfall intensity, particularly high percentile rates, when the horizontal resolution is increased (e.g., approximately 0.25°, Kopparla et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, these improvements are limited to middle and high‐latitude regions where the fractional contribution of resolved large‐scale processes to total rainfall increases most with resolution. At higher latitudes, the synoptic‐scale frontal systems that generate the majority of rainfall are better resolved at 0.25° resolution, but in the tropics the organized mesoscale systems that generate the majority of rainfall are not resolved until grids reach kilometer scales. Dai (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) compared the fractional contribution of simulated large‐scale and convective rain to observational estimates, and found that models underestimate both the large‐scale fraction and rainfall intensity in the tropics. On the other hand, increases in the contribution of large‐scale rain have also been shown to distort the representation of extreme events. Wehner et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that an over simulation of extreme rainfall in warm wet regions is associated with large‐scale processes, which they hypothesize results from the use of a fixed 1 h convective timescale in high‐resolution simulations with shorter model time steps (e.g., 15 min) that over‐stabilize the atmosphere and allow the development of saturated large‐scale instabilities. These events, sometimes referred to as grid‐point storms (Held et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), result from resolved‐scale overturning of entire grid cells, and are associated with an extreme mode climate change response in some models (Pendergrass &amp; Hartmann,
