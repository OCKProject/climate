<p class="p">Our analysis is also complementary in its focus on moderate rain rates. The influence of large‐scale versus convective processes on precipitation intensity has primarily focused on mean contributions and extreme rates, but the impact of resolved‐scale processes on moderate rain rates (i.e., amount mode and median rates) is also important because these rates generate the majority of accumulated precipitation. In this study, we explore the contribution of parameterized and resolved‐scale processes to total rainfall rates, their sensitivity to horizontal resolution and parameter settings, and their response to climate change across the entire distribution in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). We focus on the representation of moderate rain rates that generate the majority of accumulated rainfall and evaluate CAM results against observations and superparameterized CAM (SPCAM). We demonstrate several interesting properties of the isolated large‐scale component of CAM's rainfall that emerge when it is analyzed statistically in a way that clarifies contributions to total accumulated rainfall by moderate rates. The models, observations, and methods used are described in section
