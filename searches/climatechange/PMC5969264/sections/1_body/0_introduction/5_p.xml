 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-1049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) sensitivity experiments have previously demonstrated that the partitioning of convective and large‐scale precipitation influences the representation of total precipitation intensity. However, analysis of the convective and large‐scale precipitation rates in these studies has been presented in a way that convolves changes in the intensity and mean amount of precipitation. By only examining changes in the frequency distribution, these studies were limited by an inability to discriminate changes in the intensity of precipitation rates from changes in relative contributions of large‐scale versus convective components to the total amount of precipitation. For example, if large‐scale precipitation tends to be associated with more extreme rain rates, then total rain rates can become more intense by either shifting the intensity of large‐scale rates or by increasing the relative contribution of large‐scale rain to the total amount. In this study, we will present a new methodology for decomposing precipitation distributions in a way that clearly discriminates these two effects and thus, adds to what has previously been highlighted in perturbed parameter sensitivities of deep convection.
