<p class="p">Over the TRMM region, the amount distribution in CAM is significantly weaker than observed and simulated by SPCAM, primarily due to the convective contribution, which controls the peak (i.e., amount mode) of the total distribution (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). However, the large‐scale rainfall distribution in CAM contributes to more intense rates and its mode is a good match to TRMM 3B42 and SPCAM. For rates above ∼30 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, large‐scale and convective processes contribute nearly the same fraction of accumulated rainfall. This threshold is also seen in lower resolution (i.e., 1.9° × 2.5°) versions of CAM (not shown), and found in other studies (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Geographically, resolved processes produce the most rain poleward of 30° (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b, blue line), where large‐scale frontal systems drive the majority of precipitation. Convective parameterization produces the most rainfall at low‐latitudes, where local forcing in CAM drives precipitation processes. This pattern of increasing large‐scale contribution with higher latitudes can be seen in the regional distributions as well, which separate Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a into contributions from the (c) tropics, (d) subtropics and midlatitudes, and (e) high‐latitudes (note that the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis range is twice as large for the tropics). From the fractional plots in the bottom subplots, it is clear that large‐scale processes (blue lines) dominate high‐latitudes and parameterized convection (red lines) plays a larger role transitioning to the tropics across all rates.
