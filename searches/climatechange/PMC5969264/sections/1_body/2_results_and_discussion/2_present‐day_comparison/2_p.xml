<p class="p">Distributions of total rainfall as a function of rain rate and latitude are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> for TRMM 3B42 (grey), GPCP 1DD (black), SPCAM (green), and CAM (purple). For CAM, the convective (red) and large‐scale (blue) distributions are also shown along with their relative fractional contribution to total rainfall (i.e., bottom subplots). The majority of global rain in CAM is produced by parameterized convection (1.7 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) relative to large‐scale processes (1.3 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), with the largest differences in the tropics (3.8 versus 1.1 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Globally, SPCAM and CAM have similar mean rainfall values that are slightly higher than observational estimates (i.e., 2.7, 3.0, and 2.9 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in GPCP 1DD, CAM, and SPCAM, respectively).
