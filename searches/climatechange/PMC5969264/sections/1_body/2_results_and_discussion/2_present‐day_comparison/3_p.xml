<p class="p">As discussed above and in detail in Kooperman et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016a</xref>), distributions from the two observational products are very different from each other. In general, GPCP 1DD is considerably weaker than TRMM 3B42 and SPCAM, especially for the peak in the amount distribution. For most of the discussion here, we focus on TRMM 3B42 results, which span 50°S–50°N, since GPCP 1DD likely misses the intensity of rain rates on daily timescales.
