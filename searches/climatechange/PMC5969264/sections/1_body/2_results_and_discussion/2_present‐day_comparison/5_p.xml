<p class="p">Analysis of the large‐scale component of the amount distribution in CAM (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, blue lines) reveals a surprising fact—despite issues with its parameterized rainfall, the location, and peak of CAM's large‐scale rainfall distribution realistically tracks the TRMM 3B42 and SPCAM distributions. This can be seen in each region but is most significant in the tropics, where the total rainfall amount mode in CAM is biased 2–3 times low relative to TRMM 3B42 and SPCAM, but the large‐scale mode is amazingly unbiased (∼29 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for both CAM large‐scale and TRMM 3B42).
