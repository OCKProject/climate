<p class="p">To evaluate if the geographic pattern of large‐scale moderate rainfall rates in CAM is likewise realistic, Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the simulated median rain rate pattern. Equatorward of 30°, the median of total rainfall is biased low in CAM (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d) and fails to highlight key maximum activity centers that are associated with tropical waves (e.g., West Africa), monsoons (e.g., South Asia), the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO; e.g., northwestern tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean), and the Inter‐Tropical Convergence Zone. Total rainfall in CAM also has a stronger land‐sea contrast in some regions (e.g., east coast of the United States versus West Atlantic Ocean), resulting from too little continental rainfall. These features tend to dominate rain amount median maps in SPCAM and TRMM 3B42 (Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). Kooperman et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016a</xref>) pointed out that the mismatch between plots 2c and 2d emphasizes a deficiency of rainfall intensity in standard CAM that is especially clear in analyses of the rain amount mode/median.
