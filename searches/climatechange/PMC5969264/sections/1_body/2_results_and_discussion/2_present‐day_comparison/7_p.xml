<p class="p">Surprisingly, the large‐scale component of tropical precipitation does not suffer from many of the above issues when it is isolated in CAM (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e). The amount median low bias is remedied, and missing regional activity centers emerge, suggesting the essence of an appropriate modulation of moderate rainfall intensity is captured, if hidden, in CAM. This is especially true off‐equatorially and in monsoon regions; activity centers along the equator in the Western Tropical Pacific and in the SPCZ are still missing. However, the median pattern from parameterized convection is much weaker everywhere, and since it dominates total rainfall production in the tropics, median rates from total rainfall are also much weaker than SPCAM and TRMM 3B42.
