<p class="p">Overall, large‐scale processes contribute the most rainfall at high‐latitudes and to heavier rates. Despite the fact that the total accumulated rainfall in the tropics is primarily produced by parameterized convection in CAM, large‐scale rain makes a significant contribution to events that produce the heavier rates. Interestingly, the rain rates that deliver the most accumulated large‐scale tropical rain in CAM are an excellent match to observations and superparameterized simulations, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms linking resolved convection to rainfall intensity may be present in CAM. In the next section, we investigate whether these features of the amount distribution that we have identified with low resolution are also found with higher resolution.</p>
