<p class="p">Changes in the character of rainfall in response to climate forcing are assessed as differences between the beginning and end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. Under these conditions, the global mean temperature in CAM increases by 3.4°C (from 14.7 to 18.2°C) and in SPCAM increases by 3.8°C (from 13.9 to 17.7°C). The geographic pattern of this change is very similar in both models, with the largest changes over land and at high‐latitudes. For a full overview and visualization of these temperature changes, see Kooperman et al. (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in order to consistently compare the two models. Globally, both CAM and SPCAM increase mean precipitation by a similar percentage (1.6 and 1.5% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively), with a slightly larger relative increase from convective than large‐scale rain in CAM (1.8 versus 1.4% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Equatorward of 50° the relative large‐scale change in mean rainfall is even smaller (1.7 versus 0.1% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The largest percentage changes occur at high‐latitudes in both models (percentage changes are not shown), but the largest absolute changes are seen in the tropics (Figure
