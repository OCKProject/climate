<p class="p">Overall, the large‚Äêscale rainfall distribution in CAM better captures the intensification response to climate change that is simulated by SPCAM than its total rainfall distribution (i.e., Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>a is a much better match to Figure

 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>b). This includes increases in rainfall at the tail of the distribution and a broad reduction in light rates that shifts the peak amount mode toward heavier rates. The geographic pattern of median rates also highlights monsoon and ITCZ regions.
