<p class="p">The geographic pattern of the median rain rate response to climate change is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>. Like the baseline signal, the changes associated with total and convective rainfall in CAM are much weaker than SPCAM. SPCAM again highlights regions of organized convection in the tropics including the MJO (i.e., equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans), ITCZ, and monsoons. The large‐scale response in CAM captures several aspects of this change associated with the ITCZ (double‐ITCZ pattern in CAM) and monsoon regions; though some of the Indian and West Pacific response is missing. However, the magnitude of CAM's large‐scale median rainfall change is also surprisingly similar to SPCAM. The large‐scale distribution responds in a way that suggests important underlying mechanisms may be embedded within resolved processes in CAM, but that these do not produce enough accumulated rainfall at 0.9° × 1.25° horizontal resolution to be visible in the total precipitation response.
