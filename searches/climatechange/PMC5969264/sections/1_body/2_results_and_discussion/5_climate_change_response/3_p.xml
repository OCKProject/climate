<p class="p">As in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, rainfall distributions as a function of rain rate and latitude are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>, but for future climate conditions (light‐dashed lines) as well as present‐day (dark‐solid lines). The bottom plots in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> also show the change in distributions (future minus present‐day) per degree of global mean temperature change. Over the TRMM region, the total rainfall response, especially for the amount mode, is very different in the two models. SPCAM simulates a smooth rightward shift across all rain rates, while CAM increases the amount of rain from heavier rates without shifting the moderate rate peak as much. The difference between the models is primarily in the tropics; transitioning to higher latitudes the total and large‐scale responses in CAM are similar to SPCAM. The large‐scale response in CAM captures a reduction in part of the midlatitudes associated with rain rates below 20 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which resembles the shift mode response seen in SPCAM rather than an increase alone. In the tropics, CAM's total rainfall shows almost no amount mode shift, while SPCAM has a significant 8.7% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> shift response. However, the isolated large‐scale component of rain in CAM exhibits a shift in all regions, including a 2.9% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> increase in the tropics.
