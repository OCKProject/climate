<p class="p">The different sensitivities related to amount and intensity thus control the ways in which these two parameters can influence total precipitation intensity, a feature that would be obscured by analysis of the frequency distribution alone. Unlike changes in the entrainment rate, the convective timescale has the ability to exert controls on both the amount and intensity of convective and large‐scale rain. It is natural to wonder if the convective timescale could be tuned to produce a more realistic total rainfall distribution (as in Gustafson et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Within the conventional‐resolution (∼1°) configuration this seems unlikely, since increasing the convective timescale to capture the more intense rates on the right tail of the distribution will shift the convective distribution toward weaker rates. This again leads to a right shouldered (or at the extreme even bimodal) amount distribution that does not resemble the observations (Figure
