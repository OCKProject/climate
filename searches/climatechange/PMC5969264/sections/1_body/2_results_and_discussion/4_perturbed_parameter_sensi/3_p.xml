 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>f reveals a clear increase in the amount of large‐scale rain and decrease in convective rain with longer timescales. Because large‐scale processes are associated with more intense total precipitation rates in CAM, this increase in large‐scale rain contributes to more intense total precipitation rates, which is consistent with the analysis of frequency distributions in Williamson (

 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>f reveals an increase in the amount of large‐scale rain with higher magnitude entrainment rates, which also increases the intensity of total precipitation rates. Additionally, partitioning of the convective and large‐scale contributions to the amount distribution, as shown here, distinguishes changes in the amount from changes in the intensity for each component. This demonstrates that the intensity of the convective amount mode (i.e., peak in the distribution) decreases with longer convective timescales but is less sensitive to changes in the entrainment rate. Furthermore, since the large‐scale amount mode intensity increases with longer convective timescales, sufficiently large timescale increases (greater than 90 min) can lead to a bifurcated amount distribution for total precipitation (Figure
