<p class="p">In summary, unsurprisingly, the artificial separation of processes into convective and large‐scale components that contribute to the production of total rainfall in CAM limits its ability to capture a realistic precipitation distribution. Similar to Gustafson et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we find that the distribution can be improved in some ways by changing parameter settings, but improvements to some features may come at the expense of others; the amount distribution offers a complementary viewpoint from which to assess such trade‐offs. Ultimately, this artificial separation may also play a role in limiting the response of simulated precipitation to climate change, which is investigated in the next section.
