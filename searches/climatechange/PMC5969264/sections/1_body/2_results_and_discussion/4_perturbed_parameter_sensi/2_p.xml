<p class="p">Since we have argued that the partitioning of total rainfall between convective and large‐scale components is important to the representation of precipitation intensity, we begin our analysis of the perturbed parameter experiment by regressing each parameter in Table 
 <xref rid="jame20562-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> against the annual mean large‐scale precipitation fraction averaged over 50°S–50°N. This simple analysis turns out to be quite revealing and identifies two correlations that stand out in the seven parameters that have been varied for this experiment (Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b), though it is worth noting that future assessments based on more sophisticated multiple regression methods may be useful for identifying additional sensitivities. Similar to Qian et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), we find that the convective timescale (tau, R = 0.57) and parcel mass entrainment rate (dmpdz, R = −0.55) are the most highly correlated parameters. The next highest correlation is for the evaporation efficiency of precipitation (ke, R = 0.35), followed by correlations of less than 0.1. Regressions of these parameters (i.e., tau and dmpdz) against the large‐scale mean precipitation fraction, shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a, 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b, 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a, and 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b, demonstrate the variability associated with perturbing the values across all seven parameters (blue stars). When the range of entrainment rate values are constrained (red dots), most of the variability in the regression against the convective timescale is removed (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a) and the correlation in the subset of simulations increases to R = 0.91. Likewise, when the convective timescales are constrained, most of the variability in the regression against the entrainment rate is removed (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b) and the correlation in the subset of simulations increases to R = −0.94, confirming that these two parameters play an important role in governing the representation of precipitation intensity.
