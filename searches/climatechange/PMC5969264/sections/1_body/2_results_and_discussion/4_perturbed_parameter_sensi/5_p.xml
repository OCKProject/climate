<p class="p">It has also been suggested that changing the convective timescale in concert with horizontal resolution could remove unrealistic “grid‐point storms” and lead to a more 
 <italic class="italic">scale‐insensitive</italic> precipitation distribution (Gustafson et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Williamson, 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-1049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Consistent with this view, our results imply that decreasing the convective timescale could reduce the amount of rain from large‐scale processes, and that, this somewhat offsets the changes associated with high‐resolution (∼0.25°). However, since lower‐resolution configurations do not capture the intensity of the observations, this gain of precipitation 
 <italic class="italic">scale‐insensitive</italic> may be won at the cost of realism and loss of the improvements in 
 <italic class="italic">total</italic> precipitation extremes noted in previous studies (Kopparla et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>, O'Brien et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Again, decomposing the relative contributions to the amount distribution helps to illuminate these trade‐offs and their influence on total precipitation.
