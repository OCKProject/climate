<p class="p">As discussed in the methods section above, our “effective” percentile rain rate distributions are formed from a series of steps: (1) scaling the convective and large‐scale distributions to match the amount of total rainfall (i.e., multiplying by the ratio of total mean precipitation to convective and large‐scale mean precipitation, Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d), (2) dividing by the central rain rate of each bin (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b), and (3) forming a cumulative sum (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f). This demonstrates that the effective extreme rates associated with convective and large‐scale rainfall are mostly insensitive to changes in resolution. That is, large‐scale resolved processes contribute to more extreme rates regardless of resolution, but with higher resolution they produce enough rain to have a larger impact on the total rainfall rates. The rainfall rates that both convective and large‐scale processes produce seems to be mostly fixed and do not change much with resolution. This resolution‐independent behavior also extends to the geographic distribution of the amount median shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. The median from convective precipitation is weak in both resolutions relative to the large‐scale median, particularly in the tropics over monsoon regions and the ITCZ. This implies that aspects of the processes generating rainfall in these regions may be partially resolved even at low resolution. To investigate what controls this fixed behavior in the model, we next explore the sensitivities to parameter settings in perturbed parameter ensembles of simulations varying seven parameters that have been shown previously to impact the representation of precipitation in CAM.
