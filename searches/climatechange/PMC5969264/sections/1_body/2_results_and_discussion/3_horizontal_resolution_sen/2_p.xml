 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, but here comparing the 110 and 28 km configurations in hindcast simulations. The most striking result of this analysis is the stationarity of the amount mode rate, which is almost identical in both resolutions for total, convective, and large‐scale precipitation. The difference between resolutions is not so much due to the intensity of rates produced by large‐scale processes, but rather the relative contribution to the total amount of rain (area under the curve), which increases as a function of resolution. Although many previous studies have suggested that large‐scale precipitation becomes more intense and realistic with higher resolution (e.g., Kopparla et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; O'Brien et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), this analysis demonstrates that the intensity actually remains mostly unchanged (i.e., location and shape of large‐scale distributions in all regions are the same in both resolutions), and the amplitude of the distribution simply increases with resolution. When combined in the total precipitation distribution, the larger contribution from resolved processes enhances the right tail, which leads to more realistic extremes. This effect is seen over a large area between 50°S and 50°N and for rain rates greater than ∼1 mm d

 <xref rid="jame20562-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). In the tropics, the total amount of large‐scale rain is still smaller than parameterized convection, even at high resolution, so the total amount mode remains weak. Also, the separation of large‐scale and convection processes produces a right shoulder at 30–50 mm d
