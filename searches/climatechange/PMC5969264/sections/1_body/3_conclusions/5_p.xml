<p class="p">The results of this study have implications for future model development and build on a chain of work that has pointed toward improvements in the representation of precipitation intensity requiring better links between resolved large‐scale and convective processes. This work also outlines a new methodology for assessing the influence of different model components on the representation of precipitation intensity, which may be useful for evaluating new stochastic (e.g., Wang et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) convective schemes or methods that turn off the deep convection parameterization altogether (e.g., Webb et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and for investigating the roles of precipitation processes for cloud feedbacks (e.g., Webb et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and convective self‐aggregation (e.g., Becker et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This methodology effectively reveals how different components of the model contribute to both the amount of mean precipitation and the intensity of precipitation, which have typically been conflated in previous studies. Here, we have applied this method to better understand the relative contributions of large‐scale and convective rainfall in a series of simulations with varied resolution, perturbed physics parameter settings, and climate forcing. In the future, it could be worth applying a similar method to discriminate subprocesses in the model, such as separating the influences of shallow versus deep convection or cloud‐water sedimentation versus cloud microphysics in the convective and large‐scale distributions, respectively.
