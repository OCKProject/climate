<p class="p">Since organized convective systems in the tropics are not statistically resolved until grid‐scales approach the order of 1–4 km, parameterized convection of some kind is likely to be in use for years to come, and improving the realism of the rainfall it produces is critical. The methods we have outlined here provide an efficient means to evaluate the intensity distribution of simulated rainfall, test whether the next generation of climate models with updated parameterizations and higher resolution continue to suffer similar deficiencies, and discriminate the individual components that contribute to the deficiency. Our results suggest modeling schemes that more directly link large‐scale resolved processes to mechanisms controlling total rainfall production will likely produce the most realistic moderate rainfall rates. Furthermore, identifying the most realistic components of rainfall may provide an opportunity for better downscaling of GCM projections; e.g., downscaling rates based on large‐scale distributions alone in CAM may provide more consistent results than total precipitation, which includes biased convective contributions.</p>
