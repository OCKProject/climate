<p class="p">In response to climate change, CAM's large‐scale precipitation captures a rightward shift in the amount distribution that resembles the change in SPCAM, but the total amount mode does not shift because the intensity of the mode from convective processes remains fixed. This leads to an increase in extreme rates (the right tail of the distribution), but not moderate rates, which has implications for impacts assessment. Similarly, the geographic pattern of median rain rates only shows relatively small changes in the total and convective precipitation maps. However, CAM's large‐scale precipitation response to warming enhances the median in regions that are similar to SPCAM, suggesting that resolved processes in CAM are better able to capture important underlying mechanisms controlling rainfall intensity changes.</p>
