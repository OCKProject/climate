<p class="p">The preferred rain rate that delivers the most accumulated large‐scale rainfall (i.e., amount mode) is largely insensitive to the horizontal resolution, but the amount increases with higher resolution. The amount of large‐scale rain also increases with longer convective timescales and higher magnitude entrainment rates. The intensity of large‐scale rain is somewhat sensitive to convective timescale and increases with longer timescales, while the intensity of convective rain decreases. Adjusting these parameters in concert with the horizontal resolution may be useful for improving the representation of intensity or achieving a more 
 <italic class="italic">scale‐insensitive</italic> behavior, but this requires consideration of their influences on both amount and intensity contributions to the total rainfall distribution. We have demonstrated the amount distribution as a promising diagnostic for assessing such trade‐offs.
