<p class="p">In this study, we evaluated rainfall intensity simulated by conventional and superparameterized versions of CAM, as well as a perturbed‐physics ensemble of CAM, focusing on the moderate rates as represented by the rainfall amount mode and median. In general, total rainfall in CAM is unable to capture the intensity of moderate rates in present‐day climate or their response to climate change simulated by SPCAM, most notably in the tropics. Separating the parameterized convective and resolved large‐scale contributions to total rainfall in CAM reveals that this deficiency is primarily due to limitations associated with parameterized convection, which produces most of the rainfall in the tropics and controls the peak in the amount distribution. Large‐scale rainfall contributes most at high‐latitudes, to the heaviest rainfall rates, and simulates an amount mode that better matches TRMM 3B42 observations and SPCAM simulations. The geographic pattern of median large‐scale rates also highlights similar regions as SPCAM (e.g., monsoons, ITCZ, etc.), but still under‐simulates the intensity along the equator in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans (MJO region).</p>
