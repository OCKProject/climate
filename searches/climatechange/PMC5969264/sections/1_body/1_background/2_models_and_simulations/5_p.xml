<p class="p">In this study, we analyze results from three sets of complementary simulations: (1) the present‐day and future climates represented by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emissions scenario, (2) the present‐day climate simulated at conventional (∼1° or 110 km) and high (∼0.25° or 28 km) resolutions, and (3) the present‐day climate represented across a range of perturbed physics parameter settings. Since these simulations are computationally intensive, particularly high‐resolution and superparameterization members, we have based our analysis on a synthesis of preexisting simulations that were originally run for independent experiments and are available through public archives. As a result, there is some variation in the exact model version and configuration of CAM. While this in some ways limits their direct intercomparison, the simulations within each experiment sensitivity suite are internally consistent with each other, and we limit our focus to results that are robust across all of the experiments despite differences in configuration and model version. Each experiment subset is described in more detail below.</p>
