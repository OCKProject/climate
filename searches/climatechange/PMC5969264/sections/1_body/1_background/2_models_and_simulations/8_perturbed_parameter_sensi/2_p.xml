<p class="p">To explore the impact of perturbed physics parameter changes (Table 
 <xref rid="jame20562-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) on amount distributions of convective and large‐scale precipitation, we also evaluate output from a wide ensemble of simulations generated from CESM1 run with a finite volume dynamical core at 0.9° × 1.25° horizontal resolution (i.e., as in CCSM4/SPCCSM4). This experiment was originally designed to explore the sensitivity of changes in extremes to parameter perturbations, to be described more thoroughly in a forthcoming manuscript. Briefly, the experiment consists of a control set of simulations containing ∼50 groups, each of which adopts a set of parameter values drawn from a Latin hypercube design methodology described by Williamson (

Each group therefore represents a point in parameter space, and itself consists of 28 or more initial condition simulations spanning the years 2011–2013; composites across all ensemble members are used in our analysis. All control simulations use observed, time‐varying sea surface temperatures (SSTs), sea ice, greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol concentrations, insolation, and landcover, following the Climate of the 20th Century + protocol described by Stone et al. (
