<p class="p">To explore the sensitivity to horizontal resolution, we evaluate two additional sets of simulations using CAM version 5 with the spectral element atmospheric dynamical core run at both 110 km (i.e., approximate resolution of CAM and SPCAM simulations described above) and 28 km horizontal resolutions. These simulations were run with the Community Earth System Model (CESM1, successor of CCSM4) as atmosphere‐only (i.e., prescribed sea‐surface temperature and sea‐ice configuration) for 5 day hindcasts of present‐day conditions (2005–2009) initialized from Climate Forecast System v2 (Saha et al.,

Here, we evaluate only day five of the hindcasts, interpolated to a common 2° horizontal grid for both resolutions. For more details on model configuration and interpolation, see O'Brien et al. (
