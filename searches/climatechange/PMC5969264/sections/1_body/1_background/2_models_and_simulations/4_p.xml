<p class="p">In the superparameterized version (i.e., SPCAM), parameterizations of convection and boundary layer processes are replaced with simplified (two‐dimensional and laterally periodic) cloud resolving models (CRMs) using kilometer‐scale horizontal resolution, which are embedded within each grid column of the conventional CAM (Randall et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The CRMs are forced by large‐scale conditions resolved on the GCM grid and return convective (i.e., energy and moisture) tendencies as a CRM mean response (Benedict &amp; Randall, 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The approach is at least an order of magnitude more computationally expensive than CAM but readily affordable today. In SPCAM, all rainfall is generated by CRM resolved processes, which treat deep, shallow, and nonconvecting conditions in a unified framework. For more details, see Khairoutdinov and Randall (
