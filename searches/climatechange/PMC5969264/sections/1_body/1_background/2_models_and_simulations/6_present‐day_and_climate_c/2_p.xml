<p class="p">For the primary analysis in this study, both CAM and SPCAM were configured with a finite volume dynamical core at 0.9° × 1.25° horizontal resolution with 30 vertical levels, and the CRM in SPCAM was configured with 32 3 km resolution columns oriented in the zonal direction. The simulations were run for the 21st century forced by the RCP8.5 emissions scenario (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). An overview of results from these simulations is given by Meehl et al. (

 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) for CAM and SPCAM, respectively. For the results presented below, present‐day conditions are represented by the first 10 years (2006–2015) and future (end of century) conditions are represented by the last 10 years (2091–2100) of the simulations.
