<p class="p">The rainfall amount mode is the peak in the amount distribution, and is thus, associated with the rate that produces the most accumulated surface rainfall. A rightward shift of the amount mode in response to climate change suggests that not only will infrequent extreme events become more intense, but frequent moderate events will also become more intense (Kooperman et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016b</xref>). Evaluating the mode geographically shows that the regions associated with organized convection (e.g., the MJO, monsoons, and tropical waves) have the heaviest rates (Kooperman et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016a</xref>). However, assessing the mode spatially, as well as changes in response to climate forcing, can be difficult because it is based on discrete logarithmic bins that can be under sampled in regions with little rainfall and is undefined for negative changes. Therefore, for geographic assessment, we focus on the “amount median” (i.e., the rate associated with 50% of accumulated rainfall), a complementary statistic of moderate rain that is calculated independently of the bin structure.
