<p class="p">Finally, we come to the issue of geographic disparities in publication output on CC&amp;H. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the gross mismatch between areas with high vulnerability to climate change on one side (i.e. sub-Saharan Africa) and those that are the focus of health research (i.e. the United Kingdom) on the other. One could argue that this reflects the lower number of researchers per population in Africa and much of Asia and demonstrates the general imbalance of scientific production. In fact, we did not attempt to compare whether the discrepancy between the size of health problems and the amount of research is larger in CC&amp;H than in other areas, that is, cancer research (given that the vast majority of cancer patients live in poor countries, yet research originates predominately from rich ones). We can conclude, however, that this disparity between the impact of the health burden from climate change and the scientific effort allocated to it is unacceptable and needs to be remedied. Our finding of significant underrepresentation of Asia and Africa in the scientific production on CC&amp;H dovetails well with the paper by Byass (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>) and with the findings of Hosking and Campbell (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>) on a smaller set of 80 studies included in their scoping review. Funding agencies and academic and non-academic institutions could partner with the many excellent research networks and centers in the global South in order to build research capacity where the problems are the greatest.
