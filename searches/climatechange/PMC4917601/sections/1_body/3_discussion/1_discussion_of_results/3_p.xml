<p class="p">Second, the current number of publications that treat the subject of health related to climate change is still very low when compared with those of other climate-sensitive sectors. Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>) provide evidence that climate change as a risk factor for disease receives numbers of scientific publications which are orders of magnitude fewer than ‘established’ risk factors, such as smoking or obesity: within the decade from 2000 to 2010, the authors identified 875 citations on CC&amp;H but only a mere 2% of the 47,862 papers on tobacco in the same period. Moreover, of the papers on CC&amp;H, 42.7% were not original research but rather comments, editorials, letters, or reviews, compared with only 19.2% of the research on tobacco as a health risk factor. Sauerborn (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) proposed some reasons why many scientists from epidemiology or environmental health sciences do not pick up the topic of climate change. Discomfort with uncertainty which cannot be bound in statistical terms, such as p-values or confidence intervals, and the fact that effects in the future need to be modeled and are difficult to empirically assess given the long delays between exposure and outcomes are two proposed explanations.
