<p class="p">First, there is a positive and accelerating trend shown in publications on climate change and health. However, this trend is at a very low absolute level, and it would take years, if not decades, for the scientific community to close the gap if the productivity of research is the same as for other equally important risk factors for disease, such as smoking. These publications also continue to make up only a small minority of publications on climate change, and there remains much room for improvement in putting health and human effects in the center of the conversation around climate change. Health can be a motivating factor for action on climate change (

Fresh ideas are needed, as universities do not sufficiently engage in formal courses raising the interest of young scientific minds in the topic of CC&amp;H. Such courses may have on average 20 participants. We should explore other formats such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which can attract thousands of participants, to reach out to larger audiences and combine them with traditional learning in innovative ways (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). For example, a MOOC on the basics of CC&amp;H may raise the interest of 5% of participants who are then offered a presence course, a class where students and teachers are able to interact face to face, on research methods. A paper is in preparation analyzing the experience of our three MOOCs on climate change and health: one for policymakers/climate negotiators, one for the general public, and one by Africans for the African health context (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Beyond a lack of available education, powerful political and commercial forces have incentives to downplay the health effects of climate change, raising further concern that future levels of publication will not rise to the level necessary to better inform both scientific research and government and individual action.
