<p class="p">Our comparison of ‘climate change and health’ literature to climate change and other sectors was carried out in Science Direct due to its broader scope. These sectors were chosen because, like health, they both emit and are impacted by climate change to a greater or lesser degree. We demonstrate that health is evoked less than other themes across climate change literature as a whole. Our method does not preclude the same publication containing several of the selected terms and therefore being counted multiple times. Nevertheless, the level of difference of treatment of health is so large that it can be expected to persist even taking this into account.</p>
