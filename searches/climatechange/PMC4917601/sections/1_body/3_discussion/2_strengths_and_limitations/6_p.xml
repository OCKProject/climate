<p class="p">We observed a marked increase in the number of references to ‘health’ between the first and the fifth IPCC reports and a greater number of pages containing ‘health’ across the entirety of the reports (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). This increase may not only be due to greater focus given to health in climate change research alone but also to stylistic choices, increased linking of sections within the report, or a wider range of literature reviewed. Nevertheless, we can see an expansion of the role of health in the statements of the IPCC, mirroring an increased treatment of the topic in the literature.
