<p class="p">Searches by region were carried out using the names of each country as key words, grouped into geographic areas according to the United Nations regional list (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Although this method may not capture some articles, which use regional or natural references to refer to their area of study (i.e. sub-Saharan, Arctic, coastal), it is more exhaustive than other groupings. The majority of authors include the country (countries) that the article studies, and there should be no systematic bias distinguishing those who do not. We find another discrepancy in the number of results obtained with this method and the number of results found with general health keywords, again implying that articles on climate change and health lack grounding in a specific context and do not present original data.
