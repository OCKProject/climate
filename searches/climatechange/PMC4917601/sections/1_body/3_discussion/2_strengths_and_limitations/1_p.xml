<p class="p">Our search methods yield an overall picture of the trends in climate change and health research from 1990 to 2014 (searches 1 and 2). In relying on database search engines to capture relevant articles, we risk including publications that would be filtered out in a systematic or scoping review. These searches will elicit results on all types of biological health, not only human health. Articles dealing with various health effects or regions may also have been included more than once. However, the trends in publications over time, health impact studied, and geographic region studied are so significant that it seems they would persist even taking into account a certain amount of misclassification, which in any case would not have been systematic. Moreover, our findings on the number of publications on climate change and health between 2008 and 2010 correspond with the results of Hosking and Campbellâ€“Lendrum, providing confirmation for this method (
