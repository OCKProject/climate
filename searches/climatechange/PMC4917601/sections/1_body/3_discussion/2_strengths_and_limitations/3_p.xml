<p class="p">Search 3 used only specific health effects as key words (i.e. cardiovascular disease, malaria), not the general terms ‘health’, ‘disease’, ‘morbidity’, and ‘mortality’. The former searches produced far fewer results in total than the latter, although publications about specific health impacts ought to also be captured with the general health keywords (i.e. an article about malaria should also contain ‘health’, ‘disease’, ‘morbidity’, and/or ‘mortality’ as a key word(s)). This unexpected disparity between the number of results including specific health effects and the number of results about health writ large likely indicates that a majority of these publications do not contain original research and instead mention the health effects of climate change generally or transiently.</p>
