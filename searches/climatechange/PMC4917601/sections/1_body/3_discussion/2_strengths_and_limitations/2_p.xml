<p class="p">Both databases, PubMed and Science Direct, evidenced an increase in the number of publications on climate change and health, but to different degrees. In Science Direct, the number of publications on climate change and health increased in parallel with the publications on climate change alone. However, the number of publications on climate change and health articles in PubMed increased by a rate over 60% greater than publications on climate change alone. This is likely to be attributable to the difference in focus of the two databases. As Science Direct includes more articles on non-health-related topics, the relative proportion of climate change articles mentioning health would likely be less than in PubMed, which has a medical focus. Science Direct may therefore give a more accurate impression of the weight of the health argument among climate change scientists.</p>
