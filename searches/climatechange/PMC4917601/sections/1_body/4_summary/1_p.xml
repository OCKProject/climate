<p class="p">This review noted an increase in publications on climate change and health between 1990 and 2014 in the literature from two scientific databases, PubMed and Science Direct, as well as in the IPCC reports. In addition, our results demonstrated a continuing underrepresentation of certain topics, health effects, and regions where climate change is projected to have important effects. In spite of the increasing focus on the public health implications of a changing climate on the part of civil society and governments and multilateral bodies, publications on health continue to constitute only a minority of the literature on climate change.</p>
