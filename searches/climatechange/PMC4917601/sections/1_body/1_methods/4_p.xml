<p class="p">In order to assess the overall trend of publications over time (search 1, search 2), a cluster of health-related search terms were used to capture a wide range of publications concerned with health issues (‘mortality’, ‘morbidity’, and ‘disease’). The number of publications including only a climate change key word (‘climate change’, ‘global warming’, ‘climate variability’, or ‘greenhouse effect’) was tracked in the same databases to show the proportion of climate change literature evoking health. The number of publications mentioning both climate change and health was compared with the number of publications linking climate change to four other important sectors (transportation, industry, economy, and energy) to provide context for our results (search 3). For search 4, we measured the number of publications linking climate change to specific health outcomes. The health impacts were classified according to the categories of climate change–related diseases given in the 5th IPCC Report into effects of extreme events, infectious disease, respiratory disease, nutrition, and others (

 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). The names of countries in their corresponding region (i.e. ‘Burkina Faso’ and ‘Western Africa’) were used as keywords to capture the maximum number of publications with minimum overlap and greater precision. The number of times ‘health’ is mentioned in the IPCC reports and where these references occur in the reports was counted as an indicator of the overall importance of health in the scientific discourse surrounding climate change and to provide further information on the treatment of climate change and health over time (search 6).
