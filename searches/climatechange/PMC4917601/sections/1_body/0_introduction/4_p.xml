<p class="p">In the light of the recent Lancet Commission's call for further research on public health and climate change (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>), we set out to seek answers on the following five questions through bibliometric searches:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">What is the current volume of publications on climate change and health (henceforth abbreviated as CC&amp;H)?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">How does this compare with past trends since the very beginning of the field of CC&amp;H, which we set at 1990; the Rio conference; and the signature of the UN Convention on Climate Change (
    <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>)?
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">What are the trends through time and current levels of research output by health impact, such as infectious diseases, malnutrition, and so on?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">How does the amount of scientific publications compare with other sectors on which climate is known to have an important impact?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">What is the geographical distribution of current scientific output on CC&amp;H and how does this compare with the estimated magnitude of health impacts and vulnerability?</p>
