<p class="p">The problems of scientific underproduction and mismatch between the research topics and the nature of health impacts and the locations where people will suffer most from climate change will not go away, unless a concerted effort is orchestrated bringing together research funding agencies, philanthropists, universities, and non-academic scientific institutions from north and south to address this problem (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Funding alone is not the solution. Research interest needs to be sparked, research capacity needs to be increased considerably, and public health researchers need to be taught as to how to use climate models and cooperate with scientists from wide-ranging disciplines, namely meteorology, climate modeling, remote sensing, agriculture, policy, and more. This buildup of research capacity must take place in both the global North and the South, but with particular emphasis in the South, to make health an important part of action on climate change.
