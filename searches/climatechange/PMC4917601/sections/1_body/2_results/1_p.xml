 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>a and b. Publications on health in Science Direct remained in the three-digit range until 2003 (barring a peak in 1996). We observed an exponential trend since 2003, albeit with a flatter slope for health publications (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>a). The search was also carried out in PubMed, where the same increasing trend was observed, with the number of publications on climate change and health crossing the three-digit mark in 2004, plateauing briefly in 2010, and continuing to increase through 2014 (
