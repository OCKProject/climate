<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, health has been increasingly mentioned in the IPCC reports, with the number of references doubling between AR2 and AR3 and again from AR4 to AR5. The number of pages in each health chapter also almost doubled between 1990 and 2014, and the number of pages in the executive summary referencing health increased from 19 (AR2) to 30 (AR5). Less than a third of the references in the most recent report (636 out of 2,418, 26%) are found within the health chapter, the rest occur throughout the report.
