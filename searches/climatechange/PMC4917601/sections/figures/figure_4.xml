  <p class="p">Publications on health and climate change by geographic region/country studied indexed in PubMed, 1990â€“2014. The depicted size of each country was altered to reflect the number of publications in those areas proportional to their population. Searches were performed using the UN list of nations and regions as key words (
   <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). This cartogram was generated with the QGIS-cartogram plugin developed by Carson Farmer and Morten Wulff (
   <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). The World Map Shapefile used to generate the cartogram was created by Bjorn Sandvik (
   <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Data from PubMed searches were provided for each UN subregion. As the shapefile and cartogram software depended on unique weights per country, the data were normalized against area for each country within each UN subregion. Data for the United Kingdom, the United States, and China were specifically isolated from their respective UN subregion and were provided with their own weights.
