  <p class="p">Publications on ‘climate change’ and ‘climate change and health’ by year indexed in Science Direct database (a) and PubMed database (b), 1990–2014. A search was performed to find articles on climate change mentioning both a climate change term (climate change, global warming, climate variability, or greenhouse effect) and a general health keyword (health, disease, morbidity, mortality). A second search was performed for publications containing only a climate change key word. Various important events and publications in the study of climate change are noted.</p>
