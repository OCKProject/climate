  <p class="p">Distributions and boundaries of explanatory variables for multi-regression analysis and area boundaries for each explanatory variable with a weaker MBS. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The area with summer temperatures &lt;0 °C is encompassed with a light blue line. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) The areas with an annual range in monthly temperature &gt;20 °C is encompassed with an orange line. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The area with a summer precipitation ratio of &lt;50% is encompassed with a purple line. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) MBS distribution showing overlapping areas of lower summer temperature (&lt;0 °C), higher temperature ranges (&gt;20 °C) and lower summer precipitation ratio (&lt;50%) with a black dashed line. a-c are depicted based on a 0.5° grid cell. Each threshold for explanatory variables is provided in Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>, which indicates that each threshold divides the MBS values such that half are less negative (weaker) and half are more negative (stronger). These figures were created using The Generic Mapping Tools (
