<p id="Par12" class="p">It should be noted that the MBS and multiple regression analyses performed in this study depend on quality of the reanalysis datasets. In this regard, the factors controlling mass-balance sensitivity to temperature (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) also have crucial implications for projections of glacier mass change. Unrealistic seasonal patterns of air temperature and precipitation used for projected glacier mass changes would, for instance, lead to erroneous estimated changes even given accurate annual averages. In HMA, predicting the variability in monsoon extent will be a key factor in projecting glacier mass changes because changes in monsoon extent could alter the distributions of seasonal patterns of air temperature and precipitation.
