<p id="Par6" class="p">Optimized precipitation at the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), which is required to calculate MBS, was estimated using reanalysis datasets and an assumption that median glacier elevation is equal to the ELA, i.e. the accumulation area ratio (AAR) is 0.5. Actual glaciers have fluctuating masses, and therefore, the ELA does not always correspond to the median elevation. Shrinking glaciers tend to have less AAR, and the actual ELA should be higher than the median elevation. Therefore, the optimized precipitation would be overestimated over regions with shrinking glaciers. However, the discharge calculated using optimized precipitation performed well and had less bias compared to observed discharge in the HMA

 </sup>, suggesting that optimized precipitation is close to actual precipitation in glacier areas. We calculate errors in the MBS, which can be caused by uncertainty of air temperature and shortwave radiation in the reanalysis datasets. The uncertainties of air temperature (0.9 °C) and shortwave radiation (102 W m
