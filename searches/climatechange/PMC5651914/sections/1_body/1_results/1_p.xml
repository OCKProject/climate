<p id="Par5" class="p">The resulting MBS distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) is similar to the distribution of TECs obtained from remotely sensed laser altimetry observations of glacier surfaces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a and b</xref>). To quantify the correlation between MBS and TECs, we compare each value in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–c</xref> covering a 1° grid (each value is the average over the surrounding 2° × 2° region) in the scatter plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). From the first set of data
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), the coefficient of determination for the regression line is high (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.61), suggesting that over 60% of the spatial variance in glacier mass balance is due to the spatially differentiated glacier response to temperature change. As a check, we also compared the relationship with the TEC dataset over a wider region from ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) for two cases: limited to the same domain as in ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> and the entirety of HMA; we obtained lower, though consistent, correlations (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.17 for the ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> domain and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.19 for HMA). In particular, TECs from ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> at high MBS exhibit less change than those from ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, and have second order convex-downward regression curves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
