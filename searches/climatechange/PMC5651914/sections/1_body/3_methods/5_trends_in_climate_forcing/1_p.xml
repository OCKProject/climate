<p id="Par25" class="p">To investigate trends in climate forcing, we conducted trend analyses of summer (June-July-August) temperature and annual precipitation using a reanalysis data set (ERA-Interim
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>) and gridded precipitation data (APHRODITE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>). First, we calculated annual and summer data for each 0.5° grid, and then aggregated those data into each 1° covering 2° grid cell, weighted by glacier area. We further applied Sen’s trend to the annual data for each 1° grid cell from various starting years until 2007.
