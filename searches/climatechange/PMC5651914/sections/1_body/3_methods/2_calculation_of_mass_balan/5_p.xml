 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>. The relationship shows that APHRODITE precipitation data has large variability, and there is no clear relationship between temperature and annual APHRODITE precipitation data at the ELA for Asian glaciers. We cannot obtain presumable MBS without bias correcting the APHRODITE precipitation data, because suitable precipitation and temperature data are required to estimate precise MBS

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>

  <italic class="italic">opt</italic>
 </sub>), and no clear relation is found between summer mean air temperature and annual precipitation. On the other hand, the optimized precipitation shows large variability and its fitting curve becomes very close to a previously proposed approximation
