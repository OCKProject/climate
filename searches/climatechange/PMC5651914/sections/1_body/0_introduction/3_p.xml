To understand the mechanism for simultaneous mass losses in the Himalayas and Hengduan Shan with slight mass gains in the Karakoram and West Kunlun, we calculated mass-balance sensitivity to air temperature (MBS) using the Glacier Area Mapping for Discharge from the Asian Mountains (GAMDAM) glacier inventory
