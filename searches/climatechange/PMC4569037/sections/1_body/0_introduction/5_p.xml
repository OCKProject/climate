<p class="p">The specific objectives of this study were to develop a model enabling us to map the distribution of potential germination grounds for the common reed in the St. Lawrence River wetlands under current climate conditions and then use this model to predict their future distribution under two climate change scenarios simulated for 2050. We hypothesized a significant increase in the area that could potentially be occupied by common reed stands in 2050, particularly in Lake St. Pierre, a shallow widening of the river with more than 16,000 ha of wetlands, in which common reed stands are, for the moment, relatively uncommon.</p>
