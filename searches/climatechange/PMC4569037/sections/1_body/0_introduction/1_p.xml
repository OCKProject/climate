<p class="p">Climate change and the introduction of invasive species are major threats to biodiversity. The synergy of these two drivers of change will probably affect some ecosystems more than others, such as wetlands, where fluctuating water levels have a high influence on the composition and distribution of plant assemblages (van der Valk et al.

This will especially be true for the St. Lawrence–Great Lakes hydrographic system, one of the most important waterways in North America. The water supply from the Great Lakes could significantly drop in the near future because of high evaporation levels during winter due to a lack of extended ice cover (Croley

 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). A change of this magnitude to the hydrologic regime could foster the spread of several invasive wetland plants following the exposure of large germination grounds (Hudon
