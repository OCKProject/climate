<p class="p">The common reed (
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.), considered to be the most invasive plant in the marshes of northeastern North America (Lelong et al. 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Tulbure and Johnston 
 <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kettenring et al. 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), will likely flourish under the new conditions created by climate change. The exotic haplotype M (Saltonstall et al. 
 <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) was introduced along the St. Lawrence River approximately 100 years ago (Lelong et al. 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Populations were fairly rare until the 1960s and 1970s, and were primarily found along the river. Since the 1980s, they have spread inland in Québec and Ontario (Canada) as a result of the road network development, as adjacent drainage ditches provide very good habitat for the plant (Lelong et al. 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Jodoin et al. 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Although reedbeds do not cover very large areas in the St. Lawrence River wetlands, recent surveys indicated that the situation is rapidly changing: in some marshes, the invaded area has more than doubled since the beginning of the 2000s (G. Létourneau, unpubl. data).
