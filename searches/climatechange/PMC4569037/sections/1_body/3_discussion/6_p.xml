<p class="p">In summary, the model proposed in this article maps the sectors of the St. Lawrence River that are suitable for common reed establishment through sexual reproduction, under both current and future climates. It cannot, however, accurately predict when an invasion will occur or the speed at which it will progress. To do this, an algorithm for vegetative propagation would be necessary. It should also be noted that the climate change scenarios used in this article are among those presenting the greatest differences with the current climate (Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The resulting predictions are therefore particularly pessimistic. Notwithstanding, the common reed already has considerable room for expansion along the St. Lawrence River, regardless of climate change. Furthermore, hybridization (Paul et al. 
 <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Saltonstall et al. 
 <xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) may accelerate the invasion as hybrids are often more invasive than their parents in human-altered environments (Schierenbeck and Ellstrand 
 <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), and there are many populations of the native haplotypes of the common reed in Qu√©bec (Lelong et al. 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Negative impacts documented in brackishwater marshes of the coastal Atlantic regions of the United States (Meyerson et al. 
 <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Dibble et al. 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) presage the loss of biodiversity awaiting the biologically rich St. Lawrence River wetlands (Centre Saint-Laurent 
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>) as the common reed continues to expand.
