<p class="p">The haplotype M is present along the St. Lawrence River for nearly 100 years, but has only covered to date a small portion of the area suitable for its establishment and growth. A biological invasion is often an exponential process: it remains relatively dormant over time before taking hold (lag phase; Crooks

 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, the common reed is an opportunistic species, often establishing itself in wetlands following natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Chambers et al.

 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). In the absence of disturbance, the existing vegetation provides some resistance to the invasion through competition for space and light, extending the lag phase (Lavoie et al. 
 <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Byun et al. 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Differences in common reed stand size between the Lake St. Pierre sector and the other sectors of the St. Lawrence River may be due to fewer anthropogenic disturbances in Lake St. Pierre wetlands. The size difference may also be explained by the fact that the Lake St. Louis, Boucherville Islands, and Contrecœur Islands sectors are located in the heart of the most highly invaded region of southern Québec (Montérégie); the Lake St. Pierre area is located just outside this region (Jodoin et al. 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Consequently, the seed rain (propagule pressure; see Lockwood et al. 
 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) is probably more important in the Montérégie region than in Lake St. Pierre.
