<p class="p">Another model of common reed expansion in a context of future climate change has recently been published for the Great Lakes coastal zone (Carlson Mazur et al. 
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Results are difficult to compare, because the scale and methods are completely different, but this model also predicts a substantial increase (from 3600 to 13,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) by 2050 of the area suitable for the common reed, in a scenario where winters will become warmer and wetter. Water level changes were not specifically addressed, but the model suggests that common reed stands will likely expand in areas with low bathymetric slope, areas presumably corresponding to the shallowest sectors of the lakes. In both models, climate change is not a prerequisite for common reed expansion, but will probably accelerate the invasion, especially given that the species readily acclimatizes to rising temperatures and higher CO
