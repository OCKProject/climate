<p class="p">One of the assumptions of the model was that the common reed shares roughly the same ecological niche in its native and exotic range. This is important, because most of the current knowledge regarding the biology of the common reed essentially comes from the native range (Europe). Niche conservatism is highly controversial for invasive species, and there is much conflicting evidence (for a review, see Guisan et al. 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In a recent paper, Guo et al. (
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) concluded that the niche of the exotic populations of the haplotype M of the common reed in eastern North America was shifted compared to the niche of the native populations. However, this study only compared temperature and precipitation envelopes associated with the distribution of the species. To what extent this conclusion also applies to germination and seedling survival requirements remains to be verified. We are nevertheless confident in our model given its good performance in the Boucherville Island sector. Indeed, the increased proportion of sites between 2010 and 2012 which fits model predictions, that is, sites identified by the model as suitable for seed germination and seedling survival and where reed stands were observed, confirms the accuracy of the model and the relevance of the selected parameters. In other words, failures of the model to correctly predict the presence or absence in the field probably reflect the early state of the invasion rather than a poor model performance.
