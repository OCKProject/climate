<p class="p">Comparing the actual distribution of common reed stands from 1980 to 2009 in the Boucherville Islands with the distribution of germination grounds produced using the model for the same period gave a correct (i.e., a stand occurred in a germination ground) classification rate of 57% (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" class="xref">1</xref>). The model sensitivity was 87%, while its specificity was only 49%. The best overall performance for the entire study area was in Lake St. Louis (65%). For all sectors, the model sensitivity clearly outperformed its specificity; for example, sensitivity reached 97% in the Contrec≈ìur Islands, compared to 49% for specificity.
