<p class="p">Approximately 62% of the polygons identified as germination grounds for the common reed in the Boucherville Islands, but containing no reed (according to the analysis of satellite images taken in 2010) and visited for validation purposes in 2012, contained at least one new reed stand. These new stands were generally small with only a few stems not connected to nearby stands; as a result, they were not detected on the 2010 satellite images, either due to their small size or because they were initiated in 2011 or 2012. The model performance increased considerably once these new small stands were included: The rate of correct classification for the validated subsector of the Boucherville Islands increased from 59% to 75%.</p>
