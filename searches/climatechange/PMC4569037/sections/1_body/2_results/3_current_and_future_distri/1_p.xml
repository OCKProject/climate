<p class="p">The grid used for modeling reduced the level of accuracy in assessing areas that were (or were likely to be) invaded, because common reed stands in the field were generally smaller than the polygons in which they were found. However, the model made no distinction between a polygon containing a small common reed stand and one completely covered. Therefore, when the model grid was applied to predict the current (2010) field situation, the surface area of common reed stands was inevitably overestimated. As such, due to the modeling scale used, common reed stands in 2010 were predicted to occupy 49 ha in Lake St. Louis (when in fact there were only 38 ha), 262 ha in the Boucherville Islands (vs. 86 ha), 100 ha in the Contrec≈ìur Islands (vs. 34 ha), and 135 ha in Lake St. Pierre (vs. 52 ha), respectively.</p>
