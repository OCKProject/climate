<p class="p">Current distribution of common reed stands was mapped through remote sensing using high-definition WorldView–02 and QuickBird–02 satellite images taken between August 15 and September 18, 2010. A configuration of four multispectral bands (near infrared, red, green and blue) was used, providing a spatial resolution of approximately 2.4 m. Common reed stands were identified and delineated using spectral signatures developed by Létourneau and Jean (
 <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) based on training areas located in the St. Lawrence River wetlands. Because the spectral signature of the common reed is somewhat similar to that of the reed canary grass (
 <italic class="italic">Phalaris arundinacea</italic> L.), a plant species also commonly found in the St. Lawrence River floodplain, the map created from satellite images was validated in the field from helicopter (October 18, 2011) and by foot (September 13 and 14, 2011). In all, 240 previously mapped common reed stands were visited for validation, primarily in the Lake St. Louis, Boucherville Islands, and Lake St. Pierre sectors. These stands were selected through a stratified random sampling, which enabled us to confirm the presence of the common reed based on a range of stand areas (0–10 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 11–50 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, ≥51 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The map was then adjusted based on results obtained during validation. The centroid of each common reed stand retained on the validated map was localized using the same method used for the historical distribution data.
