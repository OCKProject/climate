<p class="p">Data on the historical distribution of common reed stands were gathered through aerial photographs. It is possible to distinguish stands of a certain size (≥5 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in black and white or infrared photographs at a scale ≤1:15,000 (Warren et al. 
 <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Wilcox et al. 
 <xref rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Hudon et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Maheu-Giroux and de Blois 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). This work was performed for the only sector in which common reed stands were both abundant and old enough to build a valid historical reconstruction, that is, the Boucherville Islands. The database used is based on a mapping carried out by Hudon et al. (
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), which covered 1980 (1 ha of common reed stands) to 2002 (33 ha). Using a geographic information system, the centroid of each large common reed stand, which was primarily circular in shape, was georeferenced when first detected. The most recent genetic data gathered at Boucherville Islands (Albert et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) indicated that each stand was monoclonal, created through the germination of a single seed, followed by the extension of rhizomes and stolons in every direction. The centroid of a common reed stand therefore roughly corresponds to the location of the germination bed that permitted successful reed stand establishment.
