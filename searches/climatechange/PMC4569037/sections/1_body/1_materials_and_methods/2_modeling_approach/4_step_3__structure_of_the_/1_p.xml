<p class="p">The common reed model was developed within the infrastructure of the 
 <italic class="italic">Integrated Ecosystem Response Model</italic> (IERM), a high-resolution spatial database developed by Environment Canada to evaluate the impact of water level fluctuations and flow regulation on the St. Lawrence River ecosystems (Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Morin and Champoux 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). IERM has been successfully used to predict the impact of water level changes on fish and bird reproduction, and on wetland vegetation (Desgranges et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Mingelbier et al. 
 <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). The methodology used to build the basic datasets and to run IERM is described in Morin and Champoux (
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) and Morin et al. (
 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). In summary, IERM is based on a spatial grid whose nodes are 20â€“80 m apart in shallow water areas and 160 m apart in the navigation channel. Several information layers measured in the field or modeled (topography, bathymetry, substratum, water level, current velocity, aquatic vegetation, emergent vegetation) are associated with each node. IERM not only models fluvial physics, but also simulates the spatiotemporal development of ten wetland vegetation classes (Desgranges et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>).
