<p class="p">The parameters conducive to common reed seed germination and seedling survival, as presented above (step 2), were integrated into IERM in the form of an algorithm. This algorithm was used to query the geodatabase on a daily basis (for a given year), which then returned all sites whose attributes were within the required parameters, thus identifying potential common reed germination grounds. For example, to verify the presence of an appropriate water level, which required that a site not be flooded at the beginning of the growing season, the water level was examined (based on IERM data) for all polygons each day of a given year. A count began as soon as all conditions conducive to common reed seed germination and seedling survival were met in a polygon. If there were nonflooded conditions, the other parameters conducive to germination were met, and the seedlings had at least 120 days of appropriate growing conditions (no frost), the polygon was identified as a potential site for common reed establishment. Data on temperature and water level measurements were available on daily means, while the wetland classes were reassessed yearly based on environmental conditions observed the previous years. Data related to land use and topography were kept constant.</p>
