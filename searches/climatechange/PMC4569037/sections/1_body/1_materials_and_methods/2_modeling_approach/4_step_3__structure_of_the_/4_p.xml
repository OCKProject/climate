The quarter-monthly time step divides time into 7- or 8-day blocks, for a total of 48 quarter-monthly time steps per year. Using quarter-monthly time steps permits the comparison of individual quarter-monthly time steps across years and has the advantage of not being influenced by the number of days in a year (Morin et al.
