<p class="p">Once the model performance assessed, it was used to identify sites favorable to the establishment of common reed through seeds, either based on current or simulated climatic conditions associated with various climate change scenarios. For this study, the periods compared were 1961–1989 (reference period with actual climate data) and 2040–2069 (simulated climate data; Croley

 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Simulations of river flows and air temperatures modified by climate change were carried out using mean values from the 2040–2069 period, commonly associated with the year 2050. The simulated climate data were extracted from two general circulation models integrating greenhouse gas emission scenarios, one resulting in very warm and wet conditions (HadCM3 A1FI) and the other under very warm and dry conditions (CGCM2 A21; Mortsch et al. 
 <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Among all the climate change scenarios available for modeling (Mortsch et al. 
 <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), these two scenarios were the most recent ones providing hydrologic series for the study area and corresponded to conditions that differed most from those currently known for the St. Lawrence River sector under study. The hydrologic series with climate change data were only available in a quarter-monthly time step format.
