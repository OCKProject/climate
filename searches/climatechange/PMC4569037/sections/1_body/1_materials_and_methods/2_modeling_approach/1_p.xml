<p class="p">The basic assumption of our common reed model is that a new reed stand arises from seed. This assumption is now strongly supported – especially for Québec – by several recent field and genetic studies (Brisson et al. 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Belzile et al. 
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; McCormick et al. 
 <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kettenring et al. 
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Kirk et al. 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Albert et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Consequently, the model took into account the parameters (climatic, hydrologic, and biotic conditions) associated with common reed sexual reproduction and seedling establishment. Subsequent vegetative propagation was not addressed in this study. Competition with other plant species slows the vegetative propagation of the common reed, but it does not prevent its spread (Bellavance and Brisson 
 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In other words, the model focussed on locating suitable germination grounds in wetlands as starting points for the establishment of new common reed stands. Several steps were required to develop this model; these steps are presented in the following paragraphs.
