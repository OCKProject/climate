<p class="p">The common reed model performance was assessed using indices derived from the confusion matrix (Fielding and Bell 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). The sensitivity index indicates the proportion of polygons in which seedling establishment occurred, and which were identified by the model as potential germination grounds, in relation to all existing common reed polygons. The specificity measures the proportion of polygons identified by the model as unfavorable to seedling establishment among the entire collection of polygons, and where seedlings did not establish. Lastly, the correct classification rate measures the performance of the entire model. This rate is the total proportion of polygons where concordance exists between the model and reality. Model performance was assessed for the entire study area and for each of the four study sectors.
