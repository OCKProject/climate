<p class="p">The comparison was made using a confusion matrix (Fielding and Bell 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>), which helped to determine (1) the number of polygons with successful common reed seedling establishment and that were also identified by IERM as potential establishment sites between 1980 and 2009 (true positives); (2) the number of polygons with seedling establishment but that were not identified as such by IERM (false negatives); (3) the number of polygons with no seedling establishment but where the common reed should have established stands according to IERM (false positives); and (4) the number of polygons with no seedling establishment and that were also identified by IERM as not being conducive to the emergence and survival of common reed seedlings (true negatives). To improve the model performance, various combinations of parameters were tested, for example, the inclusion or exclusion of the average daily temperature, daily temperature amplitude, water level, and wetland class. Once calibrated, the common reed model was applied to the entire study area.
