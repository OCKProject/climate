 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] assert that environmental concern does not directly affect purchase intention but rather allows consumers to understand the environmental result produced by purchasing a product. Furthermore, Arisal and Atalar [
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] note that collectivists are more attentive toward environmental topics and find that environmental concern affects individual purchase intention. Collectivists involve emotions such as empathy and indebtedness [
