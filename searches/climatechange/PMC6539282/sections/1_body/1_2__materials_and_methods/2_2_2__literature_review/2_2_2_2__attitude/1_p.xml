 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] affect purchase intention. Furthermore, Asif, Xuhui, Nasiri, and Ayyub [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] observed that attitude and health consciousness may more accurately forecast purchase intention toward organic products. As such, this study postulates that consumer attitudes toward insect foods will influence their purchase decisions. On this basis, we propose hypothesis 1:
