<p class="p">Toxic air pollutants and climate change can affect health and functioning over the life course by launching a trajectory of adverse effects related to the initial physical or developmental impairment, and/or by “seeding” latent disease that becomes evident only in later life. For example, growth and developmental delays 
 <italic class="italic">in utero</italic> associated with environmental exposures increase the risk for neurodevelopmental, respiratory, and other health problems in infancy and childhood, as well as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes in adulthood (

 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heindel 2005</xref>). Developmental problems such as childhood ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) have been associated with early-life exposure to air pollution (

 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Perera et al. 2014a</xref>). These problems may persist into adulthood, adversely affecting professional and personal life and increasing health care costs for individuals and families (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harpin 2005</xref>). There is considerable empirical evidence that early-childhood exposure to pollution affects not only health but also educational attainment and test scores (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Currie et al. 2014</xref>). A reduction in child IQ can, in turn, have serious economic consequences in adulthood: Reduced IQ at 5 years of age associated with prenatal PAH exposure has been predicted to significantly lower lifetime earnings (
 <xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Perera et al. 2014b</xref>). The impacts of climate change can also play out over a lifetime. For example, stunting of children’s bodies and brains due to malnutrition during the first 1,000 days results in lasting impaired functioning and reduced learning (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lake 2012</xref>). Early adversity and toxic stress are linked to later impairments in learning, behavior, and physical and mental well-being (
 <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sandman et al. 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shonkoff et al. 2012</xref>). This is illustrated by the finding that exposure early in pregnancy to elevated levels of cortisol, the so-called “stress protein,” resulted in significantly lower scores on measures of mental development in children (
