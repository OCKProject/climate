<p class="p">The emissions from the burning of fossil fuels include directly emitted fine particulate matter (PM), black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mercury, nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO), all of which have been associated with multiple health impacts. Sulfate and nitrates are secondarily formed from their respective gases and augment directly emitted fine PM. Ozone (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) is created by photochemical reactions in the presence of sunlight involving its precursors—volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), CO, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>—reactions that are accelerated at higher temperatures. The best studied pollutants include deeply respirable particles having an aerodynamic diameter of ≤ 2.5 μm (PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>), PAHs, which are a class of hazardous air pollutants that includes known carcinogens and neurotoxicants, and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, a strong respiratory irritant. Also emitted (but omitted here because of length limits) from burning or evaporation of fossil fuels are metals such as mercury and VOCs such as benzene. Most PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, PAHs, and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and their precursors are emitted to the outdoor air; however, small particles and gases are able to penetrate from the outdoor into the indoor environment. Indoor sources include stoves and furnaces used for cooking and heating.
