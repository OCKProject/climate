<p class="p">In many studies, exposure to air pollutants, including PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in childhood has been clearly linked to reduced lung function. For example, a prospective study of almost 2,000 schoolchildren found that children exposed to higher levels of air pollution, including NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, had significantly lower lung function growth at 18 years of age, an age when the lungs are nearly mature and lung function deficits are unlikely to be reversed. Study children who had moved to new communities with lower particulate matter levels had increased growth in lung function, whereas subjects who had moved to communities with higher levels of particulate matter showed decreased lung function growth (
