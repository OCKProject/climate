<p class="p">Exposure to air pollutants is associated with low or reduced birth weight, small size for gestational age (SGA), and preterm birth (

 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morse et al. 2009</xref>). Although the increases in risk from air pollution are generally modest (10–30% for preterm birth and low birth weight and between 5% and 20% for infant mortality) (
 <xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ritz and Wilhelm 2008a</xref>), the population exposed is very large (about 62 million women of reproductive age in the United States and 1.55 billion worldwide). In one of the few “natural experiments” tracking the health benefits of reducing air pollution, during the period when the Utah Valley Steel Mill closed down (August 1986–September 1987), particulate air pollution levels (measured as PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>; PM ≤ 10 μm) were reduced significantly (
 <xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pope 1996</xref>), and mothers who were pregnant around the time of the closure of the mill were less likely to deliver prematurely than mothers who were pregnant before or after (reviewed by
