<p class="p">An indirect effect of climate change is the increase in levels of certain toxic air pollutants. There is remarkable synergy between toxic air emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and climate change, in that higher temperatures due to climate change accelerate the formation of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from its precursors (VOCs, CO, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). For example, O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels were substantially elevated during the European heatwave of summer 2003 (
 <xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schär et al. 2004</xref>). Climate change is predicted to elevate O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels over large areas in the United States and Europe, especially in the summer (
 <xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watts et al. 2015</xref>). Daily average O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels have been predicted to rise measurably across the eastern United States, with an estimated median 4.5% increase in summer O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related deaths from climate change in the 2050s, compared with the levels of the 1990s (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knowlton et al. 2004</xref>). This seemingly small relative risk translates into a substantial attributable risk because many millions of adults and children are exposed. A median increase of 7.3% in summer O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related emergency department visits for asthma in children 0–17 years of age is projected for the New York City metropolitan region by the 2020s (
 <xref rid="r85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sheffield et al. 2011</xref>). As reviewed above, in addition to increased mortality and asthma exacerbation, O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is associated with decreased lung growth and lung function, as well as other respiratory problems in children.
