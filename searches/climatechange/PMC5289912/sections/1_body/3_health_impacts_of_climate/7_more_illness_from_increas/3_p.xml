<p class="p">Concentrations of air pollutants such as PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> are expected to increase because of changes in temperature, precipitation frequency, and air stagnation due to climate change (
 <xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watts et al. 2015</xref>). In addition, forest fires are increased by higher temperatures and lower soil moisture due to climate change, releasing large amounts of particulate matter, PAH, and black carbon. Given their small size, these pollutants can be transported hundreds of miles from their source, potentially exposing large numbers of children. As we have seen, these pollutants are associated with multiple adverse effects, most immediately respiratory symptoms, exacerbation of asthma, and chronic bronchitis in children (
