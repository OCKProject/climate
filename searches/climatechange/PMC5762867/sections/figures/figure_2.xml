  <p class="p">Top panel: Conceptual representation of the evolution of soil profiles at the Lake Dojran catchment throughout the Holocene. Areas highlighted in orange shade represent a schematic erosion depth of individual profiles. Hyphen density conceptualize clay abundances. Soil erosion depth varied over time and responded to short-lived (&lt;1,000 years) climatic events, while clay concentrations increased continuously from 12,000 to 3,500 cal yr BP. Between 3,500 and 3,100 cal yr BP, anthropogenic agricultural practices (as depicted by the plough symbol) caused the mobilization of deeper soil horizons, effectively ‘resetting’ the landscape at ~2,500 cal yr BP to soil formation conditions unprecedented during Holocene. Bottom panel is the same as in Fig.
