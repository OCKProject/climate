<p id="Par12" class="p">Lithium isotope ratios were measured at the Wollongong Isotope Geochronology Laboratory, University of Wollongong, on a Thermo Neptune Plus
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC ICP-MS). Using wet plasma conditions, a 30 ppb single element lithium tuning solution yielded a typical intensity of 1 V on 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li, while background was of the order 5–30 mV on 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li. A standard bracketing technique was applied
