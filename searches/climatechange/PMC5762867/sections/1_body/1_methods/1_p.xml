<p id="Par11" class="p">Sample preparation was undertaken in a Class 10 cleanroom at the Wollongong Isotope Geochronology Laboratory, University of Wollongong. About 10 mg of the &lt;63 µm fraction was dissolved in 48% HF and 65% HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> at 100 °C for &gt;12 hours. After drying down, samples were redissolved in aqua regia at 130 °C for &gt;12 hr to break down any fluorides. After drying down, samples were redissolved in 1.5 mL 1 M HCl. To separate lithium from the sample matrix, cation exchange chromatography was applied. The method applied in this study was adapted after Balter &amp; Vigier 2014

 </sup>. It is crucial to separate Li from other ions, especially Na, as they may suppress ionization and cause additional isotopic fractionation during analysis

 </sup>. Furthermore, it is essential to recover 100% of Li, otherwise isotopes may fractionate by up to 200‰ during chromatography

 </sup>. For this study, Savillex 30 mL micro columns (6.4 mm internal diameter, 9.6 cm outside diameter, capillary length of 25 cm) were used. Columns were vertically customized to have a capillary length of approximately 12 cm. Biorad AG50W-X8 resin (200–400 mesh) was used as cation exchange medium, with a volume of 3.06 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (9.5 cm length). Before sample loading, columns were cleaned using 30 mL of 6 M HCl, rinsed with 2–3 mL 18.2 MΩ water, and conditioned with 8 mL 1 M HCl. The latter acid was titrated to 1 M. Cation exchange columns were calibrated with seawater samples. On two individual columns, it was verified that over 99% of the original Na was removed after two column passes, while maintaining ~100% Li yield (Fig.
