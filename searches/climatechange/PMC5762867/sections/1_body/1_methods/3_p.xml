 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). Total procedure blanks (n = 3) yielded &lt;1 ng of Li, two of them yielding &lt;0.3 ng, which represents 0.06–0.67% of the amount of Li processed for sample analysis (150–500 ng). For all core samples, Li elutions were measured twice yielding isotope compositions within error of each other. Furthermore, for three different samples, two separate aliquots were processed to assess reproducibility. The average 2 standard deviation for these replicate measurements was 0.4‰. Lithium isotope composition of core sediments is shown in Table
