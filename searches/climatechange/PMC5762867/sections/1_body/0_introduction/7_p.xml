<p id="Par8" class="p">By contrast, Li isotopes show a gradual decrease from the termination of the Younger Dryas until ~3,500 cal yr BP inclusive. This suggests a continuous production of neo-formed clays illustrating increasingly more developed soils. In this case, it seems that soil development was insensitive to shorter climatic shifts (at 8,200 and 4,200 cal yr BP). Instead, it responded steadily to the termination of the Younger Dryas, during which dry and cold conditions persisted for 1,200 years

 </sup>. These results suggest that while soil erosion is sensitive to shorter climatic variations and responds over only a few hundreds of years, soil development requires longer-term climate shifts to be affected. Interestingly, even in periods where erosion was mobilizing deeper soil material (high δ
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U), the material exported still exhibited evidence for significant clay abundance in the deposited sediments (low δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li). This suggests that erosion was not deep enough to ‘reset’ the landscape and export poorly weathered material (i.e. thin to no soil cover).
