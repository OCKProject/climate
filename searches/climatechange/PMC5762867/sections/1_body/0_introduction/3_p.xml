<p id="Par4" class="p">Both Li and U isotope proxies were applied to a sediment core from Lake Dojran at the Macedonian/Greek border. The core is 7 m long and provides a record of paleo-environmental change of the past 12,500 years, at the transition from the cold and arid Younger Dryas into the overall warmer and more humid Holocene

 </sup>. Sediments deposited in this lake are derived from a relatively small watershed (275 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), underlain predominantly by silicate igneous and metamorphic lithologies. The lack of alluvial storage suggests a short sediment transfer time from hillslopes into the lake. Thus, no significant time lag between production of the isotopic signal in soils and deposition in the lake is expected. Furthermore, hydrodynamic sorting is also expected to be minimal. A total of 26 samples were taken from the core and another 11 sediment samples were collected from modern streams draining into Lake Dojran. Additionally, 11 bedrock samples were collected from the catchment. Mineral concentrations were determined, and U and Li isotopes analyzed on size fractions &lt;63 µm at the Wollongong Isotope Geochronology Laboratory, University of Wollongong.
