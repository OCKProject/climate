 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U values range from −42.3 ± 1.7‰ to 3.7 ± 1.7‰ with values increasing between 12,300 and 9,000 cal yr BP, followed by a rapid decrease to −39‰ at 8,100 cal yr BP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>). This decline is followed by a return to higher values until 5,300 cal yr BP when another negative trend occurs, reaching a minimum at 3,500 cal yr BP. Between 3,500 and 2,700 cal yr BP, values start increasing rapidly to culminate at 2,500 cal yr BP and then remain high throughout the Late Holocene except for a small negative excursion at 500 cal yr BP. Lithium isotope compositions decrease almost continuously between 12,300 and 3,500 cal yr BP, with δ
