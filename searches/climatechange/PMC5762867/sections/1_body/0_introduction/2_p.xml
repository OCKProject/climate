<p id="Par3" class="p">In this study, we investigated the relative impact of climate variability and human activity on soil systems during the Late Glacial and Holocene in south-eastern Europe. To achieve this, we used uranium and lithium isotopes in lacustrine sedimentary deposits as proxies for soil erosion and development, respectively. During chemical weathering, 
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U is preferentially lost from minerals compared to 
 <sup class="sup">238</sup>U, as a result of recoil and preferential leaching

 </sup>. This depletion continues over time since the onset of weathering (

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>), resulting in decreasing δ

 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U = (λ

 <sub class="sub">234</sub>/λ

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and number of atoms for each isotope, respectively; and subscripts 234 and 238 refer to 
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U and 
 <sup class="sup">238</sup>U, respectively). In a weathering profile, δ
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U values are expected to decrease with decreasing depth as the weathering age increases (see Supplementary Material for more details). Consequently, if erosion on hillslopes is shallow (e.g. sheet wash), sediments should exhibit negative δ
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U. Conversely, if deeper erosion (gully, bank, mass wasting) dominates, sediments should be characterized by higher δ
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U values (Supplementary Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>). Lithium isotopes (

 </sup>. The lithium isotope composition of weathering products, such as clays, therefore reflects weathering conditions shortly before the time of deposition. Clays usually have a δ

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>. In weathering profiles where primary minerals are continuously weathered into clays, soils are increasingly enriched in 
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>Li, preferentially retained in clays over 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li. Thus, decreasing δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li values reflect increasing clay formation, used as a proxy for the extent of soil development (Supplementary Fig.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup> have shown that the Li isotope composition of river sediments inversely correlates with weathering intensity. This suggests that the δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li of sediments records the conditions of soil development at the catchment scale. Thus, in this context, the measurement of Li and U isotopes in sedimentary archives such as lake sediments should allow us to determine how soil erosion and development have responded to climatic and/or anthropogenic perturbations over time.
