<p id="Par9" class="p">While Li and U isotopic records are decoupled for most of the past 12,300 years, both proxies show a sharp increase in δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li and δ
 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U values starting between 3,500 and 3,100 cal yr BP, and culminating at 2,500 cal yr BP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>). For U isotopes, this suggests a relatively rapid shift to deep sources of sediment. For Li isotopes, the increase in δ
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>Li indicates that sediments delivered to the lake are depleted in weathering products and are instead dominated by primary minerals. This suggests that soil cover was diminished to the extent that sediments delivered to the lake consisted mostly of unweathered minerals derived from the bedrock. This is consistent with a sharp increase in iron and potassium concentrations in the same core from 3,500 to ~2,500 cal yr BP, interpreted as an increase in clastic flux to the lake (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Furthermore, the sharp decrease in endogenic calcite abundance associated with an increase in primary minerals such as muscovite, biotite and augite also suggests an increase in clastic flux (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S12</xref>). To verify that the observed Holocene variations in both Li and U isotope proxies are not simply a function of varying sediment provenance, we investigated the present sediment sources of the lake, as well as the surrounding bedrock lithology. This is discussed in detail in the Supplementary Material.
