 <sup class="sup">234</sup>U values during the two cold and dry periods, around 8,200 and 4,000 cal yr BP, are interpreted as reflecting shallow erosion of top soil horizons due to a decrease in annual rainfall. This contrasts with higher values during warmer and wetter periods (Early-, Mid Holocene), when higher rainfall could have resulted in the mobilization of deeper soil layers via gully or stream bank erosion. These results indicate that soil erosion is sensitive to abrupt climatic shifts and may respond on a relatively short timescale of 500–1,000 years.
