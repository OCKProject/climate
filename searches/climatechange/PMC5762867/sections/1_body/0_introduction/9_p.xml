<p id="Par10" class="p">Along with geochemical and mineralogical data, both isotope proxies suggest unprecedented environmental changes initiated between 3,500 and 3,100 cal yr BP and peaking at 2,500 cal yr BP. Both lithium and uranium data show that by 2,500 cal yr BP, deep erosion effectively ‘reset’ the landscape, exposing poorly developed soils. Biomarker records suggest a human impact/resettlement at 3,300 cal yr BP

 </sup>. At the same time, an increasing abundance of cultivated and ruderal plant taxa show first signs of agriculture around Lake Dojran (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. These taxa peaked at 2,600 cal yr BP, implying a strong human impact associated with wide-spread land-use. A significant decrease in total tree pollen at 2,000 cal yr BP then indicates anthropogenic deforestation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). These observations show that human impact at that time was so profound that it left a distinct trace in the geological record. Since 2,500 cal yr BP and the establishment of an 
 <italic class="italic">anthropogenic landscape</italic>, there has been no return to the natural conditions experienced for most of Holocene. While the study area is relatively small (275 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and observations may be of only local significance, the timing of the establishment of an anthropogenic landscape corresponds to the expansion of urban civilizations and the development of agricultural practices

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. Studies have shown that pastoralism may also play a role on soil erosion during this time period

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. However, pollen data indicate that the most significant factor to induce the observed erosion event must have been the development of agricultural practices such as plant cultivation, and later widespread deforestation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. The latter could have been triggered by the emergence of regional trade, when large amounts of high-quality Macedonian timber were required for shipbuilding and construction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, diversifying metal smelting, production of goods, heating and cooking, as well as warfare would have also caused a high demand for wood. Therefore, we suggest that the intensive large-scale land-use, first through plant cultivation at 3,300 cal yr BP and later through deforestation at 2,000 cal yr BP, is the direct cause of the observed erosion event in the Late Holocene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Interestingly, the erosion event occurred before or at the onset of the Greek ‘Dark Ages’ (~3,200 cal yr BP;
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>). In this period, population declined, agriculture suffered, the metallurgy of bronze and the ability to write were forgotten
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. Interestingly, the erosion peaked at the same time (2,500 cal yr BP) when the Athenian empire and other southern Greek 
 <italic class="italic">poleis</italic> (city states) increased their demand for timber, especially for naval construction. If the erosion event observed at Lake Dojran is of regional significance, the associated stress on natural resources could have triggered or at least contributed to a decline into ‘Dark Ages’. Thus, while humans have impacted their environment since the onset of the Holocene, we show that the expansion of civilization in this region resulted in environmental changes that in turn could have negatively impacted human societies.
