<p class="p">The term 
 <italic class="italic">climigration</italic> was coined by Alaska human rights lawyer Robin Bronen to describe the “forced permanent migration of communities due to climate change” (Bronen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2009</xref>:68). Her paradigmatic examples are remote Alaska villages such as Kivalina, Newtok, Shaktoolik, and Shishmaref, where predominantly indigenous populations face growing threats to infrastructure and safety from climate-linked erosion and flooding. Thawing permafrost, reduced shore protection from sea ice, and increasing river flows are consequences of Arctic climate change that impact these communities (Overpeck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2005</xref>; NOAA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2015</xref>). Relocation seems inevitable given their geographical vulnerability, but that is not happening so far because of social resistance, difficulty, and high costs (GAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2009</xref>; Huntington et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2012</xref>). New governance and institutional strategies are needed to deal with this new category of displacement (Bronen and Chapin

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2015</xref>). Apart from the personal, family, and cultural dislocations of moving, funding also remains a large obstacle: A 2006 study estimated relocation costs for Kivalina alone (population below 400 at the time) as $155–$251 million, depending on the site chosen (USACE 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">2006</xref>). Much of that cost would go toward site work and airport construction, new buildings, water/sewer system, and landfill. Site choice itself remains problematic. A proposed alternative location favored in a poll of village residents (although with some dissent) was described as “geotechnically inappropriate” by USACE because it sits on permafrost, or soils mostly frozen year-round. Moreover, this alternative location is vulnerable to future threats from coastal erosion as well. Newtok, Shishmaref, and other places face similar costs and complications for relocation (Tribal Climate Change Project
