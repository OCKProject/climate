<p class="p">Might some rural community out-migration in Alaska already be climigration, happening despite government inaction but through human agency and indirect drivers (Black et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2011</xref>)? To answer this question, we look to a recently updated demographic database on Arctic Alaska that covers many of the places most threatened by climate-linked erosion (Saito et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2015</xref>). The database, containing annual time series of population and net migration from 43 communities over 1990â€“2014, provides an opportunity to systematically test for climigration by comparing out-migration rates from the most threatened communities with those from other, generally similar places.
