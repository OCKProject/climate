<p class="p">The hypothesis of unplanned climigration seems plausible for Arctic Alaska communities because in recent history, their migration flows have been volatile, substantially affecting populations (Hamilton and Mitiguy

Although actual out-migration rates prove to be lower, with many non-permanent moves, going away (or not) remains a major life choice that measurably affects source community demographicsâ€”for example, by skewing sex ratios as women disproportionately leave the villages (Hamilton and Seyfrit
