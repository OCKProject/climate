 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> elaborates the summary results graphically by showing 1990–2014 population change in the 10 USACE “priority action” communities that occur in our Arctic dataset. (The four IAWG “priority at-risk” communities in our data—Kivalina, Shaktoolik, Shismaref, and Unalakleet—comprise a subset of these 10, so they also appear in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>.) These 10 places exhibit a range of different patterns. For example, Selawik grew steadily with minor out-migration through these years. With proportionately more out-migration, the population of Deering gradually declined. Several places show signs of growth pausing or reversing due to higher net out-migration in the middle of this period, but the timing is not synchronous, and slow or negative growth has been followed by more recent increase. Unalakleet stands out visually in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> due to its relatively large decline (more than 100 people) after 1999, corresponding to collapse and closure of the local king salmon fishery (Kent and Bergstrom
