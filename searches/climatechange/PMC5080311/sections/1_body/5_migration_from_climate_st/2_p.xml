<p class="p">What about other places? Our demographic database includes many of those listed as threatened in three reports described earlier. Four database communities, including Kivalina, are classed as “priority at-risk” in IAWG (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2009</xref>). Ten database communities (including these four) are classed as “priority action” in the USACE (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2009</xref>) report. The Tetra Tech report (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2010</xref>) provides a third, non-overlapping list of places warranting “priority” or “concern.” Eighteen of these places also occur in our data. These three reports thus provide alternative ways to classify subsets of Arctic Alaska communities that are most stressed by climate change-related erosion and water problems.
