<p class="p">Regardless of which classification scheme we use, none of the comparisons shows significant differences in median net migration or population change rates—as seen either from 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> tests or the overlapping confidence intervals in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Thus, we have no evidence of greater net out-migration from the priority communities, or of lower rates of population change. If anything, the threatened places (by either USACE or IAWG criteria) are growing faster than others: Their median net migration is slightly less negative, and population growth rates slightly higher.
