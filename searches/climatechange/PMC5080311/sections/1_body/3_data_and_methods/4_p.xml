 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> Kotzebue’s 2014 population of about 3200 people is more than 70 % Alaska Native, primarily Inupiat. Bars in the lower portion of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> indicate the total number of deaths (dark bars) and births (lighter bars) for each fiscal year, July 1–June 30 (original data from ADL

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2015</xref>). The number of deaths per year ranged from 9 to 23, and the number of births to residents from 55 to 105. These seemingly exact counts of births, deaths, and population are of course subject to minor errors. A scale for deaths and births appears at lower right in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. On average, about 58 more births than deaths occurred each year. Without out-migration, the population would be constantly increasing.
