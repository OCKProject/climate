    <title class="title">Modeling mitigation strategy impacts and mitigation implications on BC’s forest sector</title>
    <p id="Par64" class="p">The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals in the forest ecosystem resulting from mitigation strategies described in this study were estimated using the Carbon Budget Model for the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). This model is discussed in detail by Kurz et al. (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2009</xref>). It was originally developed in the late 1980s (Kurz et al. 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2002</xref>) and now forms one of the core modeling engines of the National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System in Canada. CBM-CFS3 simulates annual carbon transfers that are associated with ecosystem processes and natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., wildfire and harvesting) between the atmosphere and 10 biomass pools and 11 dead organic matter pools in the forest ecosystem. The model integrates forest inventory data, growth and yield data, and information on forest management practices and natural disturbance impacts. For this study, the forest inventory data were mainly from BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations. The mitigation impacts on the forest ecosystem were then modeled by comparing changes in the carbon pools between the baseline scenario and the scenario with implementation of mitigation strategies.

    <p id="Par65" class="p">The carbon that was transferred out of the forest ecosystem due to harvest was then modeled by the Carbon Budget Model Framework for Harvested Wood Products (CBM-FHWP)—an analytical tool that tracks the fate of harvested carbon throughout the lifetime of harvest wood products (HWP) including bioenergy and includes post-consumer treatment. CBM-FHWP tracks the carbon flow associated with HWPs all over the world as long as they are originally harvested in Canada. This framework is part of Canada’s annual GHG National Inventory Report. The model uses production and export data for wood commodities from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. The framework modeled HWP carbon with the assumption that sawnwood and other industrial roundwood have a 35-year half-life and that panels and pulp and paper have half-lives of 25 and 2 years, respectively (IPCC 
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2013</xref>). Bioenergy emissions resulting from discarded products were included in the framework by assuming that 10% of discarded solid wood and paper products were used for energy and the rest went to landfills with instant oxidation.
    </p>
    <p id="Par66" class="p">The baseline scenario assumed clear-cutting harvest with 85% of merchantable stem biomass transferred to HWP throughout the province. A few years after harvest, residues on half of the harvest area were piled and burned and residues on the other half area were left in the stands for natural decay—no harvest residues were used for any form of HWP in the baseline. All regular harvest has regeneration obligations in order to maintain sustainability. Salvage harvest was applied in post-fire or mountain pine beetle damaged stands and contributed 6% of the total harvested wood. HWPs in the baseline were categorized as sawnwood, panels, other solid wood, and pulp and paper with a constant commodity mix in the future. Mitigation strategies described in this study included four related to forest management, one for HWP, and six different combinations of the five individual strategies.</p>
    <p id="Par67" class="p">The higher utilization strategy increased the average utilization rate for harvest from 85 to 86.5% during 2017–2020 as a ramp-up period and further to 90% during 2021–2050. The proportion of salvage harvest was also increased by 4%. This strategy resulted in more harvest per hectare while keeping the total harvest area unchanged. This strategy was expected to reduce harvest residues and remove more damaged timber, thus lowering carbon emissions from slashburning and natural decay. In addition, harvest areas became smaller, thus increasing the net carbon removals in the forest ecosystem.</p>
    <p id="Par68" class="p">The harvest less strategy reduced the total harvest volume by 2% in all forest management units. The direct impact of this strategy was decrease in production of all wood products. We assumed that cut blocks became more dispersed in order to maintain the quality of harvested wood. This strategy reduced the total amount of carbon transferred out of the ecosystem by reducing the harvest volume, but fewer wood products meant there was a requirement for more emission-intensive materials as substitute.</p>
    <p id="Par69" class="p">The harvest residue for bioenergy strategy kept the harvest level and utilization rate in the baseline scenario unchanged but reduced the amount of slashburning and a portion (10% for the ramp-up period and 25% for the remaining years) of harvest residues (including branches, small trees, and snags) that would have been either burned or left on site were collected and transported to up to nine different types of hypothetical bioenergy facilities to produce power and heat in place of fossil fuel energies (coal, natural gas, diesel/fuel oil, etc.) within the forest management unit. This strategy not only reduced GHG emissions from slashburning and fossil fuel burning for energy production but also increased GHG emissions from biomass transportation, processing, and combustion. In general, for the same amount of wood, burning in a controlled environment for energy generation would lead to less GHG emissions than slashburning at roadside, because slashburning creates a large amount of methane due to incomplete burning. However, since different measurements were used for the amount of slashburning (percentage of harvest area) and the amount of harvest residue for bioenergy (percentage of harvest residue carbon), more wood was burned for energy than what was avoided from slashburning and, therefore, the mitigation benefit of this strategy greatly relied on displacement effects—avoided emission from fossil fuels being substituted.</p>
    <p id="Par70" class="p">The restricted harvest strategy limited harvest to stands less than 250 years old during 2017–2050. Old forests typically store more carbon than managed forests because they have higher carbon density and thus would take longer time to restore the carbon if they are harvested. Given the age structure of BC’s forests, this strategy was expected to mainly constrain old-growth harvest in coastal regions where old forests occupy a much higher proportion of the forest than in the interior, and local ecosystems and wildlife habitats greatly rely on old-growth forests. Restricting old-growth harvest would lower the carbon loss from harvesting old trees but may also increase harvesting in younger stands, thereby offsetting some portion of the carbon benefits since younger stands that are harvested would have had a higher capacity to sequestrate carbon from the atmosphere if left to grow. In coastal areas with less available young stands, harvest volumes would drop and carbon benefits may be gained depending on the magnitude of the displacement effect resulting from less harvest.</p>
    <p id="Par71" class="p">The more longer-lived product strategy was a mitigation option that focused on HWP rather than forest management. This strategy assumed that, with the same harvest level as in the baseline scenario, shifting the wood fiber use from pulp and paper to longer-lived products would extend the retention period of carbon in HWPs given that pulp and paper products have a much shorter lifetime than solid wood products. More benefits may be gained from displacement effects due to substitution of fossil-intensive products. Since this strategy only changes the wood commodity mix and does not affect the harvest level, it can be combined with all forest management strategies discussed previously to seek more mitigation benefits.</p>
