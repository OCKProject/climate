<p id="Par59" class="p">A sensitivity analysis of discount rates was conducted for PORT2 to examine possible changes in cost per tonne values if higher monetary and carbon discount rates were applied. Considering 3 and 1% discount rates to be the most conservative assumptions, we re-estimated the cost curve for PORT2 based on a moderate assumption of 5 and 3 and also a high assumption of 8 and 6%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). The results suggested that the moderate assumption would increase the cost curve by up to 13% (from $106/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e to $119/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) to achieve up to 12Â MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e per year, and the ambitious assumption would shift the curve upwards by up to 25% (from $106/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e to $149/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) to achieve the same annual mitigation.
