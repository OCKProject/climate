<p id="Par50" class="p">Our results indicated that implementing two or more strategies simultaneously in a FMU would achieve more mitigation than having only one individual strategy. However, combined strategies may not necessarily be more cost-effective or have more socio-economic benefits. For example, the combination of the bioenergy strategy and the more LLP strategy increased the average domestic mitigation from 4.0 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e in the bioenergy strategy alone to 5.2 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e in the long term but resulted in increased mitigation cost and less GDP and government revenue (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table" class="xref">11</xref>). Strategies may or may not affect each other when combined (i.e., they are additive or not). In particular, the higher utilization strategy and the bioenergy strategy were not additive because higher utilization in harvest caused fewer harvest residues left on site, which resulted in a smaller supply for local bioenergy. In contrast, the more LLP strategy and the bioenergy strategy were additive, as shifting the wood product mix for a given harvest volume did not affect the amount of harvest residues. Therefore, whether a combined strategy was preferred varied, depending on the interaction between mitigation actions and policy goals. Further, our results also suggested that a portfolio would be superior to any single strategy applied across all FMUs. For instance, if the goal is to maximize domestic mitigation in the long run, PORT2 (panel d, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) achieved more domestic mitigation than any individual strategy during the same period (panel a, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Finally, similar to what was found by Smyth et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2014</xref>), there was a trade-off in portfolios between long-term mitigation and short-term mitigation—less mitigation would be achieved in the long term to 2050 if the best short-term portfolio for 2020 was applied. This is because most of the strategies’ mitigation contributions are nonlinear over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and different strategies would be selected in the portfolios depending on the time scale of mitigation goals.
