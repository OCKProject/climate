<p id="Par60" class="p">The biophysical mitigation potential in this study is by no means the upper limit of what can be achieved if society is ambitious in implementing changes to reduce GHG emissions. Other mitigation options involving forests have not been assessed here, such as reductions in deforestation rates, rehabilitation of stands affected by natural disturbances that have not successfully regenerated, afforestation including short-rotation bioenergy plantations (Amichev et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2012</xref>), and intensive forest management including nutrient management (Lempri√®re et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2013</xref>). Potential impacts of climate change on mitigation potentials were not considered here but need to be addressed in ongoing research. For the economic and socio-economic analyses, future work could consider dynamic price and cost assumptions.
