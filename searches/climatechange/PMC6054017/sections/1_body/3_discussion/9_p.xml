<p id="Par58" class="p">Although the strategy mixes selected by FMU across portfolios varied, higher utilization plus more LLP and higher utilization plus bioenergy plus more LLP were chosen in most FMUs in portfolios considering displacement effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), indicating that those two strategies are among the best examined here when considering mitigation efforts of BCâ€™s forest sector from a systems perspective. For the forest sector alone (ignoring displacement effects), however, the bioenergy strategy was not selected in portfolios for either long-term or short-term mitigation goals, because burning harvest residues for bioenergy created limited mitigation benefits relative to other strategies (panel b, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). When the goal was to minimize domestic mitigation cost regardless of GHG emissions reductions, completely different strategies were chosen for the portfolios.
