<p id="Par31" class="p">The socio-economic impacts of mitigation strategies were analyzed using multipliers from the national input-output (I/O) model (Statistics Canada 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2014</xref>). The value of a multiplier refers to the increase/decrease in an indicator (e.g., gross domestic product (GDP)) if the demand for the output of a given industry increases/decreases by $1 (or $1 million for employment). In this study, multipliers were used to assess impacts on employment, GDP, and government revenues in BC’s economy in response to changes in the forest sector resulting from the implementation of mitigation strategies. We considered both direct effects and indirect effects on those indicators, where the former refers to the impacts directly induced from a change in an industry’s output, and the latter measures the impacts of further output changes due to interactions among industries within BC in response to the initial changes in the directly affected industry. Given that induced effects may cause double counting (Horne 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>), we did not consider induced effects in our analysis. We also only focused on the socio-economic impacts in response to changes in BC’s forest sector—no impacts resulting from displacement effects in other industries/sectors were estimated.
