<p id="Par47" class="p">We summarize average annual domestic mitigation and associated costs, as well as socio-economic impacts, over the whole period for all strategies and PORT2 in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table" class="xref">11</xref>. In terms of individual strategies, the higher utilization strategy had the highest annual average domestic mitigation (5.0 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e/year) and the lowest mitigation cost but it had minimal socio-economic impacts. The bioenergy strategy had the second highest mitigation (4.0 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e/year) and the greatest socio-economic contributions, although the annual mitigation cost was also the highest ($248 M/year). The more LLP strategy resulted in the least domestic mitigation (1.8 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e/year) with the highest cost per tonne value ($97/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e). For combined strategies, “higher utilization” plus “bioenergy” plus “more LLP” had the highest average domestic mitigation of 10.2 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e/year with a cost of $57/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e. It also considerably increased socio-economic benefits. higher utilization plus bioenergy achieved the second highest domestic mitigation of 8.5 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e/year and had positive socio-economic impacts, especially for GDP and government revenue. Since the restricted harvest strategy provided relatively little domestic mitigation but had significant negative socio-economic impacts, we included two versions of PORT2 (with/without the restricted harvest strategy) for comparison (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table" class="xref">11</xref>). Clearly, both versions of PORT2 generated large mitigation impacts with relatively low cost per tonne values (with little of the mitigation arising from the restricted harvest strategy), but there were considerable socio-economic benefits in the version without the restricted harvest strategy.
