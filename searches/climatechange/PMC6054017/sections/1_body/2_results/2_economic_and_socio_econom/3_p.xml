<p id="Par49" class="p">To examine the economic potential of mitigation relevant to BC’s emission reduction targets, we calculated the annual averages of domestic mitigation in PORT2 with and without the restricted harvest strategy at various cost levels in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table" class="xref">12</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table" class="xref">13</xref>, respectively. We found that, in both cases, the economic potential of mitigation impacts increased substantially in later decades or if higher costs were tolerated, which was consistent with the nonlinear curves in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. However, significant reductions in the forest sector mitigation were found when restricted harvest plus more LLP was removed from the portfolio (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table" class="xref">13</xref>), indicating that excluding such a strategy reduced mitigation potential in the forest sector if no displacement effects were considered. BC’s emissions targets are a 33% reduction in 2020 and an 80% reduction in 2050 relative to the 2007 level (Government of British Columbia

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e would be mitigated under $100/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e in 2017–2020, which is only about 1.5% of the province’s 2007 emissions of 66 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e based on BC’s latest GHG inventory (Government of British Columbia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>), while the contribution of PORT2 under $100/tCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e in 2050 is 18.2 MtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e, equivalent to 28% of 2007 emissions (or 35% of the 2050 target).
