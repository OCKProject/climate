 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e. Two background studies for FAO (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016</xref>) indicated that wood products, especially panels, also play an important role in climate change mitigation because of substitution effects. Seidl et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2007</xref>) examined mitigation impacts of alternative silviculture strategies in a forest management unit in Austria. Lundmark et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2014</xref>) compared two forest management and wood use strategies to a “do-nothing” scenario from a systems perspective in Sweden. Werner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2010</xref>) investigated various forest and wood strategies using an integral model-based approach in Switzerland. In Canada, Smyth et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2014</xref>) conducted the first comprehensive study examining the mitigation potential of Canada’s managed forest and harvested wood products (HWPs). However, there are few studies that provide quantitative analyses of the mitigation potential of the forest sector in response to a series of possible mitigation strategies at national or provincial scale with considerable spatial detail. In fact, a thorough assessment of the impacts of mitigation strategies is complex due to the interaction between the forest sector and energy and other industrial product sectors, and a systems perspective is required to consider the carbon flow within and among forest ecosystems, wood products, and displacement effects when substituting wood-based products and energy for emission-intensive products (e.g., concrete, steel, plastic, etc.) and fossil fuel energy (Nabuurs et al.
