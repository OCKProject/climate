<p id="Par60" class="p">Using a land-cover change product to approximate land-use change may have resulted in an overestimation of the area of land-use change, thus impacting the baseline scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. However, this potential overestimation would not have significantly impacted the evaluation of mitigation scenarios because land-use change and disturbance rates were applied equally in both the baseline and mitigation scenarios, which isolates the impacts of mitigation actions (additionality). Even for mitigation scenarios targeting land-use change or harvest, we generally evaluated percentage increases or decreases in parameters (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), thus baseline areas of land-use change and disturbance would have little impact on the evaluation of these mitigation scenarios. Nationally-consistent remote sensing products that attribute land-cover changes to land-use conversions, disturbances, and management activities on an annual basis would greatly improve the ability to estimate ecosystem carbon balances [
