<p id="Par59" class="p">Uncertainties also exist in modeling assumptions, parameters, and datasets. For instance, we utilized average displacement factors developed at the national-scale in Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Bioenergy displacement factors are dependent on region-specific variables including population, road networks and accessibility to forests, consumption patterns, and energy demand. However, the relatively high bioenergy displacement factor applied (0.89 tC/tC) allowed us to evaluate a high potential energy displacement for which a mix of coal, fuel oil and natural gas are assumed to be avoided. Also, the production displacement factors developed for general wood use in Canada may under-represent the avoided emissions from using wood products in place of steel, concrete and plastic, given the higher displacement factors reported in the meta-analysis by Sathre and O’Connor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. However, as other studies have noted, the average value from the meta-analysis included a variety of system boundaries, which produced a large range of displacement factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Further research on bioenergy and product displacement factors in the U.S. is warranted, and additional consideration given on how to best direct incremental harvest products to avoid emissions-intensive products and fossil fuels.
