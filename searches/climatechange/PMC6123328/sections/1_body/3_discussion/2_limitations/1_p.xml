<p id="Par57" class="p">We did not analyze potential spatial or temporal leakageâ€”the risk that emissions may be displaced outside of the project boundaries resulting in a diminished mitigation benefit. For example, if harvest rotations are extended, demand for wood may shift elsewhere, which could be significant locally or regionally though insignificant at national or global scales given the size of our study landscapes. When evaluating mitigation scenarios it is important to address macro-economic factors driving supply and demand for products, and broader impacts on land use, both of which may have significant effects on the results and feasibility [e.g.
