For example, our results appear unfavorable for increasing harvest for bioenergy over several decades, but if the analysis were extended to 50 or more years, mitigation benefits are likely to be achieved as forests would have had time to recover. However, long-term analyses introduce other uncertainties resulting from the unknown impacts of climate change, natural disturbances, and socioeconomic factors, such as the reduction in fossil fuel energy displaced. Furthermore, evaluation of short-term mitigation potential is needed considering it will be necessary to achieve net zero global emissions by roughly 2060 if the goal is to limit warming to 1.5–2 °C by the end of the century [
