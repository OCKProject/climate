None of our results supported the notion that using wood for bioenergy is “carbon neutral.” Rather, our study shows that over this 32 years period increasing harvests or allocating more harvested wood for bioenergy does not result in a sufficient substitution benefit to compensate for the increase in emissions from the immediate combustion of biomass or the reduction in ecosystem C stocks and uptake, as described elsewhere [
