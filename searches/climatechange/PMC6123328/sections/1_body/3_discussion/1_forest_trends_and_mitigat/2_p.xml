<p id="Par53" class="p">The expected decrease in the net C sink of the SC site is also driven by a decline in forested area as a result of continuing deforestation, notably around rapidly growing metropolitan areas like Charleston, SC. If current rates of forest loss continue, the coastal SC site may lose nearly 7% of its forest area by 2050. In the SC site, the
