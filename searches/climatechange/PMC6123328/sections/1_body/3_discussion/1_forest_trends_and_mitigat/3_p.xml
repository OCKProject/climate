 <italic class="italic"> LLP</italic> scenario which combines both forest management and HWP actions had the largest C benefit. Extending rotations results in more growing stock left in forests to sequester C and a decrease in emissions from product use and post-consumer treatment. However this scenario has tradeoffs in that it reduces substitution benefits due to less timber supply [
