<p id="Par52" class="p">Results from these two landscapes suggest that the net C sink in managed forests of the Eastern U.S. is projected to decline under BAU scenarios. Forests in the Northern WI site may soon become a C source (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), but those in the coastal SC site will remain a C sink for several decades, even with increased harvest, because the forest is still young and productive as it recovers from the 1989 hurricane. Over much of the 20th century and continuing today, forests in the Eastern U.S. have been net C sinks due to recovery after heavy logging and clearing for agriculture from the mid-1800s to early-1900s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. The recent increase in forest ecosystem C emissions and reduced sink is largely due to forests aging (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and becoming less productive [e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] as depicted by the sigmoidal growth-and-yield curves that drive biomass C accumulation in the model (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1); [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. This trend has been documented across many U.S. national forests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] and is projected to continue through the 21st century, potentially resulting in a national-scale shift from a C sink to a C source [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Although yield curves indicate that biomass C stocks may be approaching maximum levels, ecosystem C stocks can continue to increase for many decades as dead organic matter and soil C stocks continue to accumulate. Several mitigation scenarios modeled here could reduce net C emissions while others could increase emissions.
