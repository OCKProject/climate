Financial incentives like carbon credits, direct subsidies, or tax incentives may be necessary to engage private landowners who may manage forests for profits [

Currently, forest landowners can receive carbon credits for avoided conversions, afforestation and reforestation activities, and improved forest management, all of which we found to be effective emissions reductions strategies in the forest ecosystem alone. However, to account for the net effects of mitigation activities, it is important that carbon credit systems account for emissions outside of the forest ecosystem as well as activities that explicitly target emissions associated with HWP pools along with product and energy substitution [
