 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], were also included in the systems-approach. Displacement factors were used to describe the avoided fossil carbon emissions per unit of wood carbon used. We applied the following average displacement factors, calculated at the national level for Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]: 0.54 tC displaced per tC of saw and veneer logs, 0.45 tC displaced per tC of panels, and 0.89 tC displaced per tC of bioenergy. Our study applied similar system boundaries and end-use products as Smyth et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Displacement factors for wood substitution were based on the relative emissions from a more wood-intensive product versus a less wood-intensive product for general end-uses of wood (homes, multiuse building, furniture, flooring, and decking) and included emissions associated with extraction and transportation of raw materials and manufacturing. Displacement factors for bioenergy substitution assume that only energy from fossil fuel sources were displaced and were derived by comparing bioenergy facility emission-intensities to those for the production of energy from fossil fuels for heat, electricity or combined heat and power. To calculate the avoided emissions for each product type, displacement factors were multiplied by the increase or decrease in wood products or bioenergy [
