<p id="Par35" class="p">To assess net GHG emissions and mitigation potential in forest ecosystems and the land-use sector, we employed a spatially-referenced approach with the Carbon Budget Model for the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). This is a growth-and-yield driven model that employs a gainâ€“loss method consistent with the IPCC reporting guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. CBM-CFS3 quantifies the cycling of C through the ecosystem. The model incorporates (1) forest inventory data to stratify stands by classifiers such as forest types, ownerships, stand origin and stand ages, (2) estimates of historical disturbances, harvests, and land-use change to target activities to specific stands and areas using the classifiers and eligibility rules, and (3) growth and yield curves to model growth rates and recovery. See Kull et al. [

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for details on CBM-CFS3 and data inputs. We also compared historical forest C stocks derived from the CBM-CFS3 to other empirical and process model results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] to validate CBM-CFS3 baseline results and to infer the potential C impacts of climate and atmospheric conditions.
