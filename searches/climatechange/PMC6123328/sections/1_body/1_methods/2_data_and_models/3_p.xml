<p id="Par37" class="p">We compiled site-specific model input data for the historical period of 1990 to 2011—the last year for which data were uniformly available. We obtained information on forest characteristics such as ownership, forest type, stand age (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and growth and yield curves (e.g. Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1) from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database and tools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. We determined annual area disturbed from Landsat satellite imagery-based disturbance maps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>] and followed the approach of Mascorro et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] to attribute the causes of disturbances to fire, insects, and abiotic factors using ancillary data. We used historical land-cover change estimates from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] as a proxy for land-use change. We utilized the FIA Timber Product Output (TPO) database to determine the volume of timber removals by ownership on public and private lands. We obtained data on product ratios (e.g. pulpwood, saw logs, composites, etc.) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S5) and production and export of HWP from periodic regional timber industry assessments (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]) and national statistics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Product half-lives for each commodity were based on values from Skog [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] and the IPCC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. We applied average annual land-use change, disturbances rates, and commodity production data from 2002 to 2011 to the projection period baseline (2012–2050).
