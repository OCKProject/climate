<p id="Par34" class="p">In consultation with study sponsors and companion studies in Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] and Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>], we selected two study sites to serve as case studies, Coastal South Carolina (SC) and northern Wisconsin (WI). Both sites are strongly oriented around the timber industry and thus have significant opportunities to implement changes in land management activities and the HWP sector. Each site represents a heterogeneous, multi-ownership landscape (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) with a range of management regimes, disturbance histories, and stand-age structures. Forests in both study areas are affected by a history of intensive harvesting and reversion of abandoned agricultural land to forest in the early 1900s, followed by a period of recovery, forest management, and restoration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. In the Northern WI site, the legacy effects of past land use are evident in the age-class distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and declining growth rates of stands that continue to age without recent disturbance. In contrast, forests in coastal SC are recovering from the destructive 1989 Hurricane Hugo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], resulting in younger, more productive forests at the start of the simulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The coastal SC site has experienced substantial deforestation, especially on private lands, due to rapid development and population growth in Charleston, SC in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>], while urbanization pressures are smaller in Northern WI.
