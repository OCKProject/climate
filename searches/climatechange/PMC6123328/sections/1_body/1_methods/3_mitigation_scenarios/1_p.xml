<p id="Par39" class="p">Based on consultation with stakeholders who were knowledgeable about regional forest practices and conditions represented by the study sites, we selected eight mitigation scenarios for the coastal SC site (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and five for the northern WI site (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Scenarios targeted individual ownerships, and typical forest management activities and/or product ratios.
