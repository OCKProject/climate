<p id="Par40" class="p">Total emissions for each scenario were calculated as the sum of (1) net forest ecosystem emissions due to carbon removals from the forest, on-site decay of harvest residues, and disturbance and land-use change impacts, (2) HWP emissions from commodity production, product use (including bioenergy burning), export, and decomposition from mill wastes and post-consumer use, and (3) changes in emissions due to substitution of bioenergy for fossil fuels and solid-wood products for more emission-intensive materials. The cumulative mitigation effect of each scenario was the difference between net GHG emissions (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, CO, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) of the mitigation scenario minus net GHG emissions of the baseline scenario, which isolates the effects of the targeted mitigation parameters while factoring out any effect common to the scenarios (“additionality”). We assumed stable CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels and climate throughout the simulation period for the baseline and all scenarios so that these effects would be factored out when estimating the additional changes in GHG emissions.
