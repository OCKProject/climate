<p id="Par42" class="p">Within the forest ecosystem, the baseline for the coastal SC study site remained a net C sink from 1991 through 2042 before switching to a source through 2050 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). The C sink is strongly influenced by regrowth and recovery following Hurricane Hugo in 1989, reflected in the younger age-class structure in the 1990s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). A sharp increase in timber harvesting on private lands beginning in 2006 increased C emissions. As more stands reached an older growth stage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a), mortality increased while productivity declined or stabilized causing the C sink to decline further through 2042 when the landscape is projected to become a source of C emissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). To a lesser extent, the projected increase in GHG emissions results from a decline in forested area due to continued net deforestation (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S6) of roughly 0.2%/year which occurs mostly on private lands (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3). Over the historical period, ecosystem C stocks on forested lands increased from roughly 169 tC ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 1990 to 175 tC ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2016 with National Forest lands experiencing the largest increase. These modeling results for the baseline were validated and consistent with an inventory-based stock-change model and an independent process-based model (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S7).
