<p id="Par43" class="p">The net C balance of the forest ecosystem of the northern WI site shows a steady increase in GHG emissions causing a shift from a C sink to a source in 2022 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Like coastal SC, this projected shift to a C source is largely a result of forest aging (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b) causing net volume and biomass accumulation to approach zero (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). This aging effect was coupled with a decline in forest area from deforestation of 0.1%/year. However, over the historical period, forest ecosystem C stocks across all ownerships were relatively stable, a trend that is consistent with inventory data and the process model (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S8). The process model found that increasing CO
