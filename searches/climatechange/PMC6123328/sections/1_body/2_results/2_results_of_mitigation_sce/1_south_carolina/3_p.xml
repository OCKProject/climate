 <italic class="italic">LLP</italic>) scenario ranked third, with a cumulative mitigation of 1.7 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e due to a reduction in emissions from HWP because of longer product half-lives and increased avoided emissions from using more saw and veneer logs relative to the baseline (Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a,

 <italic class="italic">bioenergy</italic> scenario, which increased the proportion of bioenergy by 10% at the cost of LLP, increased emissions by roughly 1.1 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e. This increase in emissions was largely a result of greater emissions from the HWP component by shifting LLP to bioenergy, which causes immediate emissions, and resulted in a negative product displacement effect.
