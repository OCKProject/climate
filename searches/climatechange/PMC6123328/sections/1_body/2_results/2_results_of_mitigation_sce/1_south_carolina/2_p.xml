 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). This was a result of reduced emissions from the forest ecosystem because, after timber extraction, woody residues were transferred to the HWP sector and burned in a bioenergy facility, rather than left on-site to decay over time, plus substitution benefits from avoided fossil fuel burning. Increasing the
