<p id="Par44" class="p">The two scenarios targeting land-use change on private lands had the greatest mitigation benefit: the 
 <italic class="italic">no net loss</italic> scenario represents the effect of increasing afforestation and resulted in a cumulative net reduction of 5.2 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e by 2050. The 
 <italic class="italic">reduce deforestation</italic> scenario had a net reduction of 3.1 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e by 2050 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a) and ranked first until 2033, but then was surpassed by the 
 <italic class="italic">no net loss</italic> scenario as the annual mitigation increment increased substantially in the 2030s and 2040s (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">no net loss</italic> scenario resulted in a three-fold increase in the rate of afforestation to over 1300 ha per year on private lands, whereas reducing deforestation on private lands by 25% per year still resulted in a net loss in forest land annually (Additional file
