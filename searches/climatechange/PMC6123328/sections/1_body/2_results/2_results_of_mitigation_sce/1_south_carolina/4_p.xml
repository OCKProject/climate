<p id="Par47" class="p">The two hurricane scenarios, 
 <italic class="italic">Hugo salvage</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">increase salvage</italic>, which salvaged dead wood at varying rates after a hypothetical hurricane in 2018, had positive mitigation benefits relative to the no salvage baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S10). Both scenarios resulted in fewer forest ecosystem emissions as less dead wood was left on-site to decay, which were counteracted by a comparable increase in HWP emissions due to more wood being processed and utilized (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S10). Thus the mitigation benefit was mostly due to salvaged wood displacing both emission-intensive fuels and building materials. The largest average annual mitigation benefit of salvage logging occurred in the year of the hurricane, and was reduced thereafter (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
