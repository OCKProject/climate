<p id="Par50" class="p">The three bioenergy-related scenarios ranked lowest and two of them increased emissions relative to the baseline (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b). As in SC, increasing use of logging 
 <italic class="italic">residues</italic> for bioenergy had a mitigation benefit (2.1 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e by 2050) by reducing ecosystem emissions and increasing substitution for fossil fuels, which outweighed the negative effect on HWP given higher emissions from additional bioenergy. Also like the SC site, shifting utilization from LLP to 
 <italic class="italic">bioenergy</italic> had a negative effect on HWP as it resulted in more immediate emissions, which were not completely compensated by a reduction in fossil fuel use. The increase 
 <italic class="italic">harvest for bioenergy</italic> scenario ranked last, causing a cumulative increase in net emissions of 12.5 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e relative to the baseline by 2050. Despite having a strong energy displacement effect, increasing harvests for bioenergy was not able to offset increased emissions and lost productivity from more trees being harvested and increased instantaneous oxidation from biomass burning (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b).
