<p id="Par65" class="p">Based on the scenarios we examined in this 32-year timeframe, maintaining or increasing forestland, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the highest mitigation potential. Creating portfolios of multiple land management and HWP scenarios may have considerable mitigation benefits and more realistically reflect the suite of management activities that are often applied across landscapes. We evaluated several bioenergy scenarios and found that bioenergy use may only have a mitigation benefit under longer timeframes and for certain feedstocks such as logging residues which would otherwise go unutilized, but not green roundwood which could instead be used for longer-lived products or remain in the forest to accumulate carbon. Timeframe is also important to consider because the most effective scenario may change over time and some scenarios may require longer timeframes than this analysis period to yield mitigation benefits. Consideration of the displacement of emission-intensive building materials and fossil fuels is critical in ranking mitigation scenarios. However, there is still significant uncertainty in the product and energy displacement, which is likely highly variable between sites and warrants additional research.</p>
