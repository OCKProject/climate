<p id="Par64" class="p">This research highlights the importance of taking a systems approach that assesses net emissions from the forest ecosystem, land-use change, HWP, and avoided emissions when evaluating forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios across large, multi-ownership landscapes. The value of applying systems perspectives are increasingly being recognized since emissions reductions in one component (e.g. forest ecosystem) could be offset by an increase in emissions in another component (e.g. product substitution). While some scenarios had considerable mitigation benefits by offsetting emissions from fossil fuel burning or substituting products, these benefits may be negated or outweighed by the increase in C emissions from the products sector or forest ecosystem. Results suggest that implementation of mitigation activities in the forest sector could help reduce the weakening C sink in these study sites.</p>
