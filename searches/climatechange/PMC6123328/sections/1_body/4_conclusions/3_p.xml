<p id="Par66" class="p">Every scenario we examined has tradeoffs, risks, and uncertainties. Designing mitigation scenarios must be locally relevant to the main factors driving C emissions and land management approaches and policies already in place for individual ownerships. The results and conclusions from these two case studies in the U.S. are not universally applicable, but rather are specific to the assumptions and parameters of each mitigation scenario, and to the two regions and timeframe for which they were applied. Carbon management adds another complex dimension to existing forest management objectives. The most effective forest sector mitigation scenarios are likely to be those that achieve atmospheric benefits while also enhancing or retaining co-benefits and ecosystem services such as biodiversity, water quality, and the economy.</p>
