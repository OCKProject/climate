<p id="Par30" class="p">Sustainable forestry activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing carbon (C) stocks in both forest ecosystems and wood products, including product substitution benefits, can make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. To date, the U.S. remains legally committed to reducing net GHG emissions by 26â€“28% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Furthermore the U.S. Mid-Century Strategy set ambitious goals of an economy-wide reduction of GHG emissions of at least 80% below 2005 levels by 2050 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Achieving these goals requires a diverse range of mitigation activities across all economic sectors, including substantial contributions from forests and wood products. Carbon sequestration by U.S. forests currently offsets approximately 15% of annual C emissions from fossil fuels in the U.S. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] and studies have indicated significant potential to increase this service [
