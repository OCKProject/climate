 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Our principal objective was to use a systems-based approach (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) that complies with IPCC and national reporting guidelines to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios against projected “business as usual” (BAU) baseline scenarios across two regionally-representative landscapes in the U.S. This study was part of a coordinated tri-national investigation which applied a consistent methodology across a total of six sites in the U.S., Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] and Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] representing a range of forest ecosystems, climates, and disturbances, and management regimes. The data and methods also build upon past studies which assessed historical baseline ecosystem C stocks and influences across the U.S. National Forest System [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. We expand the previous research to include analyses of projected C dynamics across two, multi-ownership landscapes and by integrating accounting of HWPs and substitution benefits. In consultation with stakeholders from each site, we evaluated a limited set of site-specific scenarios that represent practical ways to sustainably manage forests to reduce GHG emissions while minimizing tradeoffs with other ecosystem services and if possible, increasing production of forest commodities.
