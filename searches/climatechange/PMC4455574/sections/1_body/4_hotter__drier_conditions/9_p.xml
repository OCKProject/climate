<p class="p">Ulrich Pöschl, a chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, is now investigating how quickly increased O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations and humidity at ground level can modify birch-pollen proteins enough to cause a heightened allergic response. “Under clean and dry outdoor conditions, you have just a few percent of modified proteins occurring over a day,” says Poschl. “But with more O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and higher humidity, the protein reactions can be quite fast, modifying dozens of percent in a day.”
