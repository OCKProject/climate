<p class="p">Ground-level ozone (O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) is one of the major air pollutants discussed in terms of climate change. Some refer to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in terms of “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” says Megan L. Melamed, executive officer of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project. The ozone layer located in the stratosphere, which protects human life from harmful ultraviolet radiation, is the “good.” Ground-level O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, with its myriad adverse health effects, is the “bad.” O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> also acts a short-lived climate pollutant, contributing to the greenhouse effect—the “ugly.”
