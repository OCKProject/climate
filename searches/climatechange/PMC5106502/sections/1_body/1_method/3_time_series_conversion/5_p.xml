<p class="p">Transformation of historical precipitation data to future climatic periods was based on the second KNMI transformation method (Bakker and Bessembinder 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2012</xref>). Firstly, the yearly summer maximum hourly precipitation intensities were adjusted according to the mean change (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Subsequently, we changed the number of “wet hours” in winter and summer by adding or removing precipitation events before and after historical precipitation sequences. The precipitation intensity and duration of new wet hours were set equal to the historical seasonal precipitation rate and duration of all wet hours per season. Thirdly, the precipitation intensity of all wet hours was changed according to the mean change in precipitation amount (corrected for the changes under the two prior steps).
