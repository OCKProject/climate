<p class="p">The historical climatic period 1981–2010 served as the reference climatic period (Van den Hurk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, we used these reference meteorological data in combination with the projected changes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) to create future meteorological data sets. The data in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> are, however, expected 
 <italic class="italic">means</italic>, whereas in reality these mean changes will be the result of a series of “extreme” conditions. Therefore, we used two time-series conversion methods developed by KNMI to create future 30-year hourly meteorological time series based on the period 1981–2010 and adjusted for the expected mean change and a variable’s natural variation (Bakker and Bessembinder 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2012</xref>).
