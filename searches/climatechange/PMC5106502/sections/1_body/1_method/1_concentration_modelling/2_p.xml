<p class="p">To determine the actual concentration change due to climate change effects, we investigated the change in concentration at:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">A static receptor point, where we read the modelled concentrations. This receptor point is not directly linked to exposure of individuals, but rather a convenient proxy for population exposure, resulting from emissions from a single source. Thus, we considered 30-year climatic periods to investigate the total variation in time. We assumed a steady-state wind direction (270°) and put the receptor point 1 km downwind.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">A spatial area of size 20 × 20 km with grid cells of 500 m in size. Since the aim of this analysis was to investigate spatial heterogeneity where we focused on seasonal-averaged concentrations in a single year, namely the Q fever year 2009 and reference years 2044 and 2064.</p>
