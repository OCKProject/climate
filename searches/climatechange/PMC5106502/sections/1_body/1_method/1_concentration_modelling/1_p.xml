 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015b</xref>) described the application of an atmospheric dispersion model to the Dutch Q fever outbreak, namely the OPS-ST (Operational Priority Substancesâ€”Short Term) model (version 10.3.2). This model was developed by the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) to describe the transport of gases and particles in the atmosphere (Van der Swaluw et al.
