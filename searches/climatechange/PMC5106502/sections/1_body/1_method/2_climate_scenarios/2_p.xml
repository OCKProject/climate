<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> summarises the projected changes of temperature, precipitation, wind speed and global radiation (based on Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in Van den Hurk et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>)). Temperature and precipitation changes were defined for all seasons. Changes in wind speed (winter only) and global radiation (summer only) were defined for a single season. Changes in local wind directions were not taken into consideration following (Van den Hurk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>). We used the meteorological definition for seasons, i.e., winter, spring, summer, and autumn start on the 1st of December, March, June, and September, respectively.
