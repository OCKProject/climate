<p class="p">Effects of climate change are more likely to be observed when considering long-term meteorological data sets (Marotzke and Forster 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this study, we used 30-year observed and projected meteorological data to quantify the effect of climate change to airborne pathogen concentration for the periods 2016–2045 and 2036–2065. We concluded that for four out of five scenarios the concentrations generally decrease as a result of increased global radiation, temperature and increased wind speeds, whereas for one scenario the concentrations generally increase. Nevertheless, the differences between and especially within seasons are large. Since coincidence of emission and specific meteorological conditions largely determines the actual exposure, additional investigations are required to further quantify the change in predicted concentrations of airborne pathogenic bioaerosols by taking into account pathogen inactivation and more detailed probability functions on precipitation, snow and large-scale circulation.
