 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2012</xref>). Infected goats and sheep were associated with the epidemic with the airborne pathway being the main route of transmission. The epidemic caused approximately 497 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 symptomatic cases, while in comparison the 2009 influenza epidemic caused eight times less DALYs per 1000 symptomatic cases (Brooke et al.
