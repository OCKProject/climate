<p class="p">In the current study, we focused on the effects of climate change on airborne transmission of pathogenic bioaerosols (such as airborne bacteria and viruses; Després et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>), which are able to cause infections in humans and animals by penetrating into the alveoli (Stuart and Wilkening 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2005</xref>; Wéry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>). Modelling airborne pathogenic transmission was performed in several studies using atmospheric dispersion models (ADMs) (Van Leuken et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015a</xref>). ADMs are mechanistic models, initially developed for pollutant dispersion modelling (Holmes and Morawska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2006</xref>), and describe the spatial and temporal particle spread as a function of meteorological conditions, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, atmospheric stability, global radiation, and humidity. The spatial range of pathogen transmission in the outdoor environment extends from less than a metre up to multiple kilometres and even more and is highly dependent on meteorological conditions that influence particle/pathogen dilution and pathogen inactivation (Jones and Harrison
