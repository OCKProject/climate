<p class="p">Essentially, the temporal coincidence of emission and specific meteorological conditions is crucial for the degree of exposure. After all, the occurrence of a shower can make a difference between no, limited, or full exposure. However, this is not different from current conditions. Therefore, our results indicated the probability that certain exposure events will occur more frequently or less frequently. On average, the modelled concentrations do not change substantially, only in the order of a few percentage points. However, extreme changes were calculated during specific meteorological conditions. This is particularly interesting concerning infectious diseases.</p>
