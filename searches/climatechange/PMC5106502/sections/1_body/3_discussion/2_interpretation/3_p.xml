<p class="p">The effect of modified concentrations on health outcome depends on the host-specific dose (as a function of variables including breathing volume, exposure time, particle sizes, and airway geometry (Rostami 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2009</xref>)) and pathogen-specific and host-specific response effects (Teunis and Havelaar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2000</xref>). As mentioned in the Methods section, the current study is part of a series of studies investigating the spatial transmission of

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> representing years 2009 (and 2044 and 2064) to determine to what extent modelled concentrations in 2009 were exceptional. They show that the 2009 concentrations were rather average in spring and summer, but relatively high in winter and relatively low in autumn. Given the fact that most human infections occurred in spring, the 2009 concentrations were not exceptional: had the outbreaks occurred in years during which meteorological conditions favoured higher concentrations, the number of humans infected might even have been higher.
