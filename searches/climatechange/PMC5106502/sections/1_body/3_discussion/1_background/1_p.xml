<p class="p">The effect of climate change on pathogen behaviour was investigated in several studies (e.g., Dukes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2009</xref>; Sterk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>; Danovaro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2009</xref>; Koelle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2005</xref>; Hellberg and Chu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, these studies mainly focused on foodborne and waterborne pathogens. To our knowledge, the effect of climate change on concentrations of airborne pathogen has not been investigated yet.
