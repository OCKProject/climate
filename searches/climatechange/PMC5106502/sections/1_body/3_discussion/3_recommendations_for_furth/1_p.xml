<p class="p">In this explorative study, we investigated the possible effects of climate change on modelled concentrations of airborne pathogens, represented by particulate matter (PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>). We used existing tools to convert observed meteorological data from a historical climatic period to future hourly values given a mean expected change of four variables and their natural variation. There are, however, several factors that may be very crucial and that might be incorporated or be improved:

   <p class="p">Precipitation predictions: we used a relatively simple precipitation conversion tool developed by KNMI (Bakker and Bessembinder 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2012</xref>). Precipitation, however, largely influences the particle deposition rate (Van Jaarsveld 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2004</xref>). The absence or occurrence of precipitation is of much more influence than the actual change in precipitation intensity by climate change. Development of precipitation probability curves might improve the concentration prediction, possibly by applying a Monte Carlo approach.

   <p class="p">Pathogen inactivation, although of critical importance (Jones and Harrison 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2004</xref>), was not considered.

  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Effect of snow cover was not considered either, although its effect on (modelled) concentrations is rather large. Firstly, our atmospheric dispersion model assumes a reduction of the surface roughness length to 5 cm in case of a snow cover (whereas 28 cm is the mean roughness length in our reference area) (Van Jaarsveld 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2004</xref>). Secondly, a snow cover causes the air layer above to cool down, thereby causing it to become more stable. As a result, vertical atmospheric mixing is reduced or prevented, and surface concentrations remain high. Therefore, it would be recommendable using or creating a more detailed snow prediction model including the climate change parameters for precipitation and temperature.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Inclusion of circulation patterns: we assumed a constant wind direction to determine the change of concentration at a single receptor point. However, by including actual wind directions, geospatial plots could be created with expected differences in concentrations. Moreover, by including (probability curves of) expected changes in circulation patterns, the effect of large-scale circulation patterns may be quantified as well (although the actual location of a source will be more determinant).</p>
