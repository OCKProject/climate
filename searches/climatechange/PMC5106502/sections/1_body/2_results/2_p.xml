<p class="p">Considering the 95 % intervals, the effects in winter and summer are generally largest. In winter, the largest effects occur under Scenarios 2030 [−5.1; 0.7 %], 2050-II [−5.2; 0.9 %], 2050-III [−1.4; 8.4 %], and 2050-IV [−6.8; 1.8 %], which is mainly caused by changing wind speeds (Figs.
