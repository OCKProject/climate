<p class="p">In general, mean changes are limited up to several percentage points. Note that the effects are both positive and negative due to each variable’s natural variation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The effect of climate change at individual hours is, however, much larger, given the maximum and minimum hourly changes in Fig.
