<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the mean, 95 % interval and maximum and minimum change in seasonal-averaged concentration in an area of 20 × 20 km. In fact, the spatial change in concentration is rather heterogeneous: although the mean concentration does not change significantly, concentrations in individual grid cells decrease up to 20 % and increase up to 31 % at some places.
