 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows boxplots of the modelled mean seasonal concentration of the historical climatic period 1981–2010 (subplot A), and the variability of the seasonal modelled change in concentration given the five scenarios at a single receptor point. None of the scenarios results in a significant mean change in concentration, and only some small changes can be observed in spring, summer, and autumn under Scenario-2030 and Scenario-2050-I.
