This calibration curve is offset from the terrestrial curves by several centuries to account for the incorporation of ancient carbon from ocean upwelling into mollusc exoskeletons. In addition, we calibrate marine dates using local averaged ΔR offsets and errors by interpolating to the geographically-closest sampling site, acquired through an online repository

A sample of calendar dates equal to the number of bins are drawn from the fitted model, converted to
