<p id="Par12" class="p">We propose that a combination of factors was responsible for sustained demographic downturn evident in the summed probability distributions. Relatively sudden, high-amplitude variability in precipitation patterns acted as “climatic shocks”

 </sup> may have caused small changes in precipitation to have disproportionate impacts on human-occupied niches. Populations that were adapted to early Holocene conditions may have first suffered negative impacts to their resilience, translating to increased vulnerability to comparatively small-scale climatic events after 8.2 k cal BP. Concordantly, where climatic instability is less pervasive, for example in the Southern Cone as defined here (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, bottom), the negative effects on demography are lessened in comparison to regions where some degree of climatic oscillations endured, as in the tropical Highlands and Lowlands. Nonetheless, after 6 k cal BP, our archaeological 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C proxy in tropical regions is sufficiently recovered to be consistent with, or exceed, model expectations. The continental confidence envelope is surpassed in the Highlands by the onset of the early Holocene at 4.2 k cal BP, while the Lowlands do so well before this point in time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
