 </sup> highlights the deep antiquity of cultivation practices in the Neotropics. These and other species were integrated into diversified and likely regionally-specific multi-crop procurement systems at various times after 8.2 k cal BP

 </sup>. We suggest that the development of these intertropical systems is a crucial development in the context of significant population reduction relative to earlier periods. Under the stresses induced by both demographic and environmental conditions, anthropic ecologies that already incorporated cultivated or managed resources before the mid-Holocene may have become proportionately more important to subsistence strategies in the face of an unstable climate

 </sup>. The increasing visibility of cultivated plants in the palaeobotanical record from the mid-Holocene could suggest that climate change may have promoted the incorporation of a greater proportion of managed plants into tropical forager subsistence systems
