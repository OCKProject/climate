<p id="Par11" class="p">A key influence on summer monsoon precipitation is the seasonal procession of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and its interaction with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) over tropical South America. As the magnitude of ITCZ movement southwards is ultimately driven by orbitally-forced changes in North Atlantic surface temperature, negative anomalies result in a northerly (&lt;10 °S) mean latitude of the ITCZ

 </sup>. This leads to a reduction in precipitation in eastern Brazil and southern Amazonia, generally in antiphase to wetter conditions in the northern and western portions of the continent during such events, including the tropical Andes

 </sup>. Our selection of proxies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) provides a long-term average of variability in this mechanism in latitudinal cross-section across tropical South America, as well as a separate index of precipitation in the southern mid-latitudes of the continent, which are predominantly influenced by the relative strength of Pacific westerlies

 </sup>. Furthermore, simulated precipitation grids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, top) suggest that the highest variance at the start of the mid-Holocene occurred in a broad arc across the tropics, from the north of the continent to eastern Brazil, inflected via western Amazonia. The central Amazon and circumscribed areas of the Pacific coast experienced the least variability in tropical precipitation patterns over this period. The latter agrees with the suppression of the ENSO phenomenon in the Pacific during the mid-Holocene

 </sup>, although overall the southern latitudes of the continent present the least variable precipitation patterns. Although flora responded to overall more xeric mid-Holocene conditions, biome-scale vegetational transitions appear not to have been severe when averaged over approximately four millennia
