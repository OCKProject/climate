<p class="p">Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that migration evolves to maximize fitness in a seasonal environment [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Migratory animals thereby target the most profitable areas [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], balancing their energy requirements with available resources, within ever-changing ecological landscapes. Such complex spatio-temporal match/mismatch of migratory species with their biotic and abiotic environments shape migratory dynamics and the fate of populations on the move [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Migrating animals are thus particularly vulnerable to climate change and resulting environmental modifications [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Among birds, most long-distance migrants breed at high latitudes, where climatic changes have the strongest amplitude and seasonally travel to more favourable wintering grounds [
