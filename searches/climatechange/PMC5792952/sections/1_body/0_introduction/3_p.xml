<p class="p">Bird sensitivity to climate change has been mainly studied during the breeding season. In particular, drastic changes in phenology have been noticed worldwide, triggered by shorter winters in polar and temperate regions [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Such phenological changes, that differ between species, can lead to a mismatch between food availability and demands for reproduction with strong impacts on breeding success, particularly for migrating species [
