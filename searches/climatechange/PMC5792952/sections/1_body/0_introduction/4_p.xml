<p class="p">A prerequisite to understanding how wintering animals are affected by climate change is to quantify the ecological benefits of seasonal habitat choice. For this purpose, it is essential to define and use ecological metrics that will allow researchers to rate and compare the profitability of wintering areas. According to evolutionary theory, these fitness proxies should show functional relationships with the capacity of each individual to survive and reproduce [
