<p class="p">Despite the great success and the necessity of such studies, they require long-term population monitoring and individual phenotyping, which are both extremely time-consuming and costly, particularly for long-lived species, like many migratory birds. Animal energetics offer a powerful, short-term alternative [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the concept of energy landscapes (hereafter ‘energyscapes') seems extremely relevant and attractive for mechanistic explanations of animals' geographical distribution. Specifically, Wilson, Shepard and collaborators defined energyscapes as ‘environmentally dependent variation in the cost of transport, driven by variation in parameters such as incline, substrate type, vegetation, current speed, or direction' [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Here, we propose to broaden the concept of energyscape and define it as variation in the energy requirements of an organism across geographical space as a function of environmental conditions. In addition to the cost of transport, our definition thereby includes all costs associated with body maintenance and thermoregulation. Energyscapes are, consequently, highly sensitive to climatic conditions.
