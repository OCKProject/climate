<p class="p">In this study, we determined monthly energyscapes for an Arctic migrant, the little auk (
 <italic class="italic">Alle alle</italic>), and used them to test hypotheses related to wintering ecology in a climate change context. Little auks are the most numerous seabird of the Arctic (with an overall population estimated between 40 and 80 million individuals) and they are key components of Arctic marine food webs. Their winter migration across the North Atlantic has only recently been depicted through the use of miniaturized electronic geolocators [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Because the little auk is the smallest of all seabirds in the Atlantic Arctic, with a body mass of 150â€‰g, its morphology makes it a particularly attractive model for the study of avian energetics in a migratory and wintering context. Indeed, its mass-specific resting metabolic rate is approximately seven times that of Emperor penguins (

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], and therefore energetic constraints acting upon little auk winter migratory decisions are predicted to be drastic. Finally, little auks feed on zooplankton, especially Calanoid copepods, which show a strong response to the climate-induced increase of North Atlantic surface water temperatures [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It is therefore an excellent model species for the study and forecast of the marine ecological consequences of rapid warming in the North Atlantic.
