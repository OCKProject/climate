<p class="p">We took advantage of a large dataset on little auk migratory movements in the North Atlantic. This information was collected over 6 years using geolocators for a little auk population which breeds in East Greenland and predominantly overwinters off Newfoundland. Once the location of this wintering hotspot had been identified, we used the mechanistic model Niche Mapperâ„¢ and remote-sensing information to assess the energyscapes of birds within the North Atlantic. Then, we used resource selection functions (RSFs) to compare little auk spatial distribution with the modelled energyscapes and abundance of zooplankton prey. This approach allowed us to characterize the energetic strategy of wintering little auks, and to go further than the correlative approach of [

Finally, using climate forecasting models, we modelled the future energyscapes of little auks in their wintering region, to assess the potential impacts of forthcoming North Atlantic climate warming. As temperature is predicted to be the main driver of little auk energy requirements during winter according to [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], we expected that little auk energy demands would consequently decrease due to this warming.
