 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171883F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>, bird positions were summed by longitude and latitude for each non-breeding month (migration + wintering periods). Over the study period (2009–2015), GLS recordings showed that little auks migrated to their wintering grounds in October (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171883F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). Birds wintered off Newfoundland, between 40° N and 55° N and 35° W and 55° W, at nearly 3000 km from their colony. They remained within this area until February, and migrated towards their breeding grounds in March (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171883F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows a clear overlap between little auk distribution and peaks of 
 <italic class="italic">C. finmarchicus</italic> abundance over the winter months. Hence, the timing of migration matched the narrowing (October) and broadening (March) of the
