<p class="p">The sensitivity analysis revealed that little auk daily energy requirements are mainly driven by SSTs and air temperatures (electronic supplementary material, file S3). Little auk daily energy requirements in the North Atlantic followed a latitudinal gradient, with higher energy requirements at higher latitudes all year round (figures
