<p class="p">We investigated changes in energy requirements within the core wintering area of little auks (defined as the 50% kernel density contour of the positions from 1 November to 28 February) for three decades centred in 2010, 2050 and 2095, using climatic projections based on two IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios: one reflecting a low greenhouse gas concentration trajectory (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP 2.6) and one reflecting a high concentration trajectory (RCP 8.5). Based on model comparisons by [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] for our studied area, we chose the Canadian Earth System Model v. 2 (CanESM2), which reproduced the best observed climatic trends off Newfoundland. Climatic predictions for sea-surface temperatures, air temperatures, cloud cover and relative humidity were downloaded from

As Niche Mapper™ requires a minimum and a maximum value for each input variable, and only mean values were available from CanESM2, we calculated min/max from the observed amplitude within the same variables from ICOADS data. Niche Mapper™ was run for each year of the three decades using both scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). Then, for each month and each run, we calculated the mean daily energy requirements of little auks within their core wintering area (
