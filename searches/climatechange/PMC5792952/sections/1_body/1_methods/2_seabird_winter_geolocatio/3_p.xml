<p class="p">GLS data were analysed with British Antarctic Survey (BAS) softwares (TransEdit and Locator) for BAS and Biotrack devices, and with Intiproc
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> for Migrate Technology devices. In both cases, the light intensity threshold was set to 10 lux, and the sun elevation angle to −3°. Two positions per day were obtained for each bird, one at local noon and one at local midnight. Points on land and outside the study area (70° W–15° E, 30° N–80° N) were removed. All bird handling procedures were approved by the Government of Greenland (Permits nos. 66.01.13, 2011–047447, 2012-065815, 2013-083634 and 2014-098814) and validated by the ethics committee of the French Polar Institute (Permit no. MP/53/06/12). Tracking data are available on Movebank (
