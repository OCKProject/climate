<p class="p">Fieldwork took place at Ukaleqarteq (Kap Höegh, Liverpool Land, 70°44′ N, 21°35′ W), East Greenland. Breeding adults were equipped with light-level archival tags (GLS) each summer from 2009 to 2014 and recaptured the following years. All GLSs weighed between 0.8 and 1.5 g (0.6–1.1% of the lowest equipped bird weight). GLS types, technical characteristics and deployment/recapture details are available in electronic supplementary material, file S1. In total 244 GLSs were deployed, 102 were retrieved and 94 data files were exploitable. Three birds were equipped for 2 years, and one bird for 3 years. Birds were captured either in their underground nests or with a lasso placed on the rocks surrounding their nests. They were weighed and fitted with a metal ring on which a GLS was attached using a cable tie. Previous investigations showed that GLS deployments had no measurable impacts on little auk body condition [
