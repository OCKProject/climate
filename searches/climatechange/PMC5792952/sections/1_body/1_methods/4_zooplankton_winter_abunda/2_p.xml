 <xref rid="RSOS171883C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. This is an explicitly spatial model (at 0.5° × 0.25° grid size) where at each discrete location the population is divided into surface (0–100 m depth) individuals and deep diapausing individuals. The surface population is further divided into discrete development classes that map on to the naupliar and copepodite stages. Development rate and egg production depend on the local temperature and food availability. A proportion of individuals entering the pre-adult (CV) copepodite stage join the diapausing population and emerge as surface adults (CVI) in the spring. Temperature and spatial transport for the model was determined using outputs from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling Project [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The spatial extent of the model encompasses our entire study area, as defined in the previous section, and we used the modelled abundances of the surface CV and CVI copepodite stages as our proxy for little auk prey. The current version of this model does not yet allow forward projections of 
 <italic class="italic">C. finmarchicus</italic> abundance due to a lack of reliable projections of phytoplankton abundances.
