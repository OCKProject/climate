<p class="p">However, one potential barrier to the poleward shift of little auk wintering areas is the decrease in daylight duration and the polar night, but this does not seem to directly impact Arctic seabirds, as individual seabirds, including little auks, have been found to actively forage during the polar night in Greenland, Spitsbergen or the Barents Sea ([

Yet the polar night also limits winter primary productivity at high latitudes, as well as the carrying capacity of the coastal ecosystem with respect to apex predators. In this context, poleward range expansions may also enhance inter- and intra-specific competition [
