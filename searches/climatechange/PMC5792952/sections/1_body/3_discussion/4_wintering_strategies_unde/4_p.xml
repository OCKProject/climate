<p class="p">Currently, seabirds (including little auks) that winter at higher latitudes in the Labrador Sea may rely on different prey communities [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Indeed, energy requirements are higher further north [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], but prey of these areas are richer in lipids [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. In particular, copepods from colder waters are bigger and richer in lipids [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Changes in winter distribution will be facilitated in species that show a low individual consistency in their wintering areas. While seabirds were until recently seen as highly consistent in their wintering locations [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], this understanding is changing [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], and among Alcids in particular, individual consistency varies strongly between species, suggesting some plasticity in wintering ecology [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. In this study, preliminary results on little auks equipped with GLSs during two or three successive years confirm that they are not always wintering at the same place (electronic supplementary material, file S4).
