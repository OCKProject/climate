<p class="p">Finally, a northward shift of little auk wintering grounds could be beneficial because it reduces overall migration distance. In the case of little auks from East Greenland, wintering in the Labrador Sea instead of the area around the Grand Banks of Newfoundland would reduce migration distance by about 1000â€‰km, corresponding to 33% of their current migration distance. Such a shortening in migration distance has been observed in some terrestrial bird species [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], and an experimental study has even shown that residency can evolve rapidly in a passerine population if selection pressure towards shorter migration is maintained [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Migrating closer to the breeding area is not only beneficial because of a decrease in travel costs, but also because it allows a better detection of the environmental conditions occurring at the breeding grounds, so as to match resource phenology at the breeding site [
