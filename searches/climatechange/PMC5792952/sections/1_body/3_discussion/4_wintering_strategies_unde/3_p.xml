<p class="p">Thanks to the continuous plankton recorder survey [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], the spatio-temporal evolution of zooplankton species has been well studied in the North Atlantic during the last 50 years. A northward shift in zooplankton assemblages and in the copepod 
 <italic class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</italic> has been demonstrated for the Northeast Atlantic [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] as well as for the Northwest Atlantic [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], whereas no changes have been found so far for the Arctic species 
 <italic class="italic">C. glacialis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. hyperboreus</italic> that form an important food link at higher latitudes [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The authors speculate that this may be due to the southward penetration of water from the Labrador current into the Northwest Atlantic [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. These studies suggest that seabird visitors may have to move northwards to target their preferred prey during winter. It is, however, not clear whether prey will move further north in the Labrador Sea. Recent climatic models suggest a cooling of the Labrador Sea due to a local collapse of deep-ocean convection [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] that would prevent 
 <italic class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</italic> range expansion.
