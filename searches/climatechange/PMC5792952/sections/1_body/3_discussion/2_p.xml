<p class="p">Our detailed analysis of little auk wintering energyscapes and prey fields in a climate change context, support our first hypothesis: the wintering grounds of little auks were shaped by both prey availability and energyscapes. Yet, prey fields seemed more important than energy requirements to explain bird winter locations. Our results also partially support our second hypothesis: forthcoming climate warming will substantially modify energyscapes for little auks wintering off Newfoundland under a high emission scenario only. Overall, our study highlights the relevance of the emerging energyscape concept as a methodological framework for the study of animal migration ecology and evolution in the context of global change [
