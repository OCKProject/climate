<p class="p">Little auk wintering areas are also crucial for many other seabird species [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], and even for birds from the Southern Hemisphere during the boreal summer [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], and Southwest Greenland itself hosts seabirds from the whole Arctic [

Therefore, the energyscape concept illustrated here, as well as associated analytical tools, will also be of great use for the general ecological understanding of the evolution of aquatic bird migration in the North Atlantic, in a global change context.
