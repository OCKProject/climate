<p class="p">In this study, we took advantage of existing, detailed knowledge of Calanoid copepod distribution and habitat models in the North Atlantic [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. While the importance of 
 <italic class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</italic> in the winter diet of little auks is still a matter of debate, we considered that 
 <italic class="italic">C. finmarchicus</italic> density and distribution was a good proxy for overall little auk prey availability, as they fed either on those prey, or on species from the next trophic level, such as amphipods and krill when they wintered off Newfoundland [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Interestingly, little auk timing of migration correlated closely with 
 <italic class="italic">C. finmarchicus</italic> range restriction in autumn, and range expansion in spring (
