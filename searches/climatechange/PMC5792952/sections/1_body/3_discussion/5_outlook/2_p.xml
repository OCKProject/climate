<p class="p">With the present study, we have broadened the concept of energy landscapes as defined by Wilson, Shepard and collaborators [

 <xref rid="RSOS171883C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and redefined it as the spatial variations in energy requirements of an animal at a specific moment in time. Therefore, in contrast to [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], this approach does not require recording detailed accelerometry data to estimate transport cost for each study individual, but rather some knowledge of environmental conditions encountered through time, and on species time-budgets and metabolism. Energyscapes calculated with Niche Mapper™ can consequently be used in a much wider range of species and ecological contexts [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. These two approaches could nonetheless be used complementarily if accelerometry data help fine-tune NicheMapper™ input parameters.
