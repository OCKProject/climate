<p class="p">Our study of little auk wintering ecology has also demonstrated the overarching importance of prey fields, for a thorough understanding of individual strategies and population biogeography under climate change. Therefore, once functional relationships between prey availability and predatory performance become known for little auks [
 <xref rid="RSOS171883C84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], we propose further expanding the energyscape concept to include this information. Energyscapes would then be defined as the energetic profitability, for a given species at a given time, thereby setting an exciting target for future investigations of species biogeography in a changing world.
