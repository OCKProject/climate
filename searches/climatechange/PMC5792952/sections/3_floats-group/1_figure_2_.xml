   <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (red, dashed line) and little auk mean daily energy requirements in kJ d

   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) and latitude (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) and per month. The numbers of positions are low in August and May because most of the birds are already above the polar circle and permanent daylight does not allow positioning using GLS recorders. Similarly, bird position is not indicated during the summer (June and July), but their position was known as they were breeding at our study site in East Greenland.
