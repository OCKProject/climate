<p class="p">Climate change refers to relatively stable changes in the meteorological parameters like precipitation and temperature over a period of time in a given region. Such a climate change has been described as a critical global challenge,[

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] especially due to the fact that human activities have been contributory to changes in global climate. It has been observed that over least few decades the average global temperature has risen by 0.5°C due to anthropogenic emissions,[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and projections for 2100 AD suggest that average global temperatures will rise by 2.4–5.8°C.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] Such gradual increase in temperatures is likely to be associated with melting of ice caps, submergence of coastal areas, adverse precipitation events, and floods and droughts in different regions.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] Such change in climate on a global scale is likely to affect the mankind in many different ways. The effect of global climate change is likely to be more severe in developing countries.[
