 <p class="p">Much remains unknown about the genetic status and population connectivity of high-elevation and high-latitude freshwater invertebrates, which often persist near snow and ice masses that are disappearing due to climate change. Here we report on the conservation genetics of the meltwater stonefly 
  <italic class="italic">Lednia tumana</italic> (Ricker) of Montana, USA, a cold-water obligate species. We sequenced 1530 bp of mtDNA from 116 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> individuals representing “historic” (&gt;10 yr old) and 2010 populations. The dominant haplotype was common in both time periods, while the second-most-common haplotype was found only in historic samples, having been lost in the interim. The 2010 populations also showed reduced gene and nucleotide diversity and increased genetic isolation. We found lower genetic diversity in 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> compared to two other North American stonefly species, 
  <italic class="italic">Amphinemura linda</italic> (Ricker) and 
  <italic class="italic">Pteronarcys californica</italic> Newport. Our results imply small effective sizes, increased fragmentation, limited gene flow, and loss of genetic variation among contemporary 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations, which can lead to reduced adaptive capacity and increased extinction risk. This study reinforces concerns that ongoing glacier loss threatens the persistence of 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>, and provides baseline data and analysis of how future environmental change could impact populations of similar organisms.
