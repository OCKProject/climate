<p class="p">Arlequin analyses were run twice to test both fine- and coarse-scale genetic differentiation. First, we performed a within-stream analysis that kept all sampling sites separate to see if substantial fine-scale local (&lt;2 km) genetic differentiation could be identified. For example, in Lunch Creek, we sampled four within-stream locations separated by 0.5 km or less. We calculated genetic diversity within and differentiation between each of these locations separately. Second, we performed within-basin analyses by combining sampling sites that were near each other (&lt;2 km) as long as they were not separated by potential geographic barriers such as mountain ridges. This reduced the number of populations from 16 to 10 (
