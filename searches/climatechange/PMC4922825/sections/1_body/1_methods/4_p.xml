 </sub> values were calculated using Arlequin 3.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Gene diversity is roughly equivalent to the expected heterozygosity of diploid data, representing the probability that two randomly selected homologous haplotypes (alleles) from a population will be different. Nucleotide diversity is the probability that two randomly selected homologous nucleotides in the population will be different. Arlequinâ€™s Fst calculations incorporate genetic differences between alleles. Geographic distance matrices were calculated using Geographic Distance Matrix Generator [
