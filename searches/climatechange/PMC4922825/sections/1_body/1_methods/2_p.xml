<p class="p">We extracted DNA from legs, thoraces, or whole insects using DNEasy tissue kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We PCR-amplified two protein-coding mitochondrial genes, COI and CytB. COI primers were modified for this study from LCO1490 and HCO2198 of Folmer et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]: F–TGTCCATATTTGYCGAGATGT and R–CTTATGTTTTCAAAACATATGC. We used RedTAQ Genomic DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the following conditions: 94° for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94° for 30 sec, either 58° (COI) or 50° (CytB) for 40 sec, and 72° for 60 sec, followed by 72° for 5 min and a 4° hold. PCR products were cleaned using a combination of Exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase. PCR products were Sanger sequenced in both directions using ABI 3730XL technology and the PCR primers. DNA sequences were corrected and aligned using CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corp., Centerville, MA, USA), concatenated using SequenceMatrix [
