<p class="p">We explored for the presence of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) in our data using the recommendations from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157386.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> of Song et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. We found no ghost bands in our agarose PCR gels and our sequences were generally very clean, with high quality scores and virtually no double peaks. Furthermore, our sequences contain no stop codons or nonsense mutations. BLAST searching confined to other Nemouridae species revealed no pairwise gaps and the vast majority of substitutions being at 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> and 3
 <sup class="sup">rd</sup> codon positions, suggesting strong stabilizing selection on a functional gene. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KX212679-KX212864).
