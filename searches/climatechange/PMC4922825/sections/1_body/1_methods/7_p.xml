<p class="p">In order to better compare allelic richness between populations and species, we used HP-Rare [
 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] to standardize population sample sizes. HP-Rare employs a rarefaction method to estimate allelic richness based on the smallest or other chosen sample size in a study. We ran the software on all populations with more than seven individuals from all three species. Total populations meeting or exceeding this threshold were seven from

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>, Gâ€™
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>, and D
 <sub class="sub">est</sub> for both modern and historic populations, and to calculate 95% confidence ranges for these estimates.
