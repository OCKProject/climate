 <italic class="italic">Lednia tumana</italic> (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) is endemic to the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park region of Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia and is an obligate denizen of cold meltwater streams immediately below glaciers, permanent snowfields, and alpine springs [

 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> is likely tied to that of the regionâ€™s rapidly disappearing glaciers [
 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; 125 of the estimated 150 glaciers existing in 1850 have disappeared, and the remaining 25 are predicted to be gone by 2030 if current warming trends continue. The loss of these glaciers and perennial snowfields is projected to reduce suitable habitat for
