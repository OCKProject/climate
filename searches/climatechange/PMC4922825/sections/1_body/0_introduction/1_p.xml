 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These processes are having profound impacts on aquatic invertebrate communities in glacially fed, headwater streams [

Substantial progress is being made in understanding how these species are likely to respond to climate warming, which is critical in developing conservation and recovery programs, yet much remains to be learned about the potential genetic effects of climate change on alpine stream biota, especially invertebrates [

 <xref rid="pone.0157386.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The critical need to better understanding climate change’s genetic consequences is underscored by the fact that reductions in genetic diversity likely to accompany climate change also reduce the adaptive capacity, and thus evolutionary potential, of affected organisms.
