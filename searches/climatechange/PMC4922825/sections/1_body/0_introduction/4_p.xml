<p class="p">Here, we use analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to explore population genetic structure and connectivity among 10 populations of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>, and test the hypothesis that subdivision is increasing due to fragmentation over time. We chose to analyze mtDNA because it is easy to extract from historical samples (that were not collected or well preserved for DNA analyses), and because only mtDNA data exist for comparisons to related species. To help qualitatively test patterns of diversity and subdivision, we compare results to published mtDNA data from two other stonefly species, one from the same family and found in a high-latitude environment, and another from the same geographic region. Our data help clarify species and population status, inform endangered species listing considerations, and offer valuable insight into the potential impacts of climate warming on the genetic diversity of cold-climate freshwater invertebrates.
