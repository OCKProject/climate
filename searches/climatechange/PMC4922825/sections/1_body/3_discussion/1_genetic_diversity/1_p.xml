<p class="p">The results of our population genetic analyses are consistent with those found in a small but growing body of literature addressing genetic diversity and divergence in alpine-adapted aquatic invertebrates threatened by climate change. Such studies suggest that the loss of alpine glaciers is causing significant declines in both taxonomic [
