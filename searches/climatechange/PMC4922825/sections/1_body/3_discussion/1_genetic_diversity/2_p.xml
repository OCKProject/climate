 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations bear the signature of recent declines in genetic diversity. Mean nucleotide and gene diversity for historic samples were higher than those for the 2010 samples (7.4 x 10

 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> and 0.60 vs. 0.30, respectively, including only populations with n&gt;6). Furthermore, in spite of extensive sampling, we found no LtB haplotypes in 2010 populations, including many that were within 3 km of historic sampling sites where LtB was found. Additionally, historic populations had higher mean allelic richness than 2010 populations (2.5 vs. 2.0). This apparent loss of genetic diversity in
