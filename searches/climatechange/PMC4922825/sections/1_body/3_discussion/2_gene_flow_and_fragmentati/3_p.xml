<p class="p">Our interspecific comparisons of stonefly species also suggest reduced gene flow and higher fragmentation in

 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>. For example, the two well-sampled populations of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">linda</italic>, Ramsay Creek (n = 119) and Eastern Creek (n = 57), are separated by only 10.1 km, a value comparable to many of the 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> sites in this study. The terrain around Churchill has few dispersal barriers, being quite flat, and having a great deal of suitable intervening habitat. It is therefore not surprising that the

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>

 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">linda</italic> populations was effectively zero, indicating panmixia. The mean pairwise

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> value from the combined analysis among 2010 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations with similar separation (&lt;17 km) was higher at 0.04, and may be the result of partial isolation, reduced gene flow, or a combination of the two, perhaps due to more mountainous terrain. This higher mean 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
