 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> value between historic 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations and modern populations was 0.23, a value influenced by the presence of the LtB allele in the historic samples and suggesting substantial genetic change over time. Similarly, mean

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> values between historic 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations was 0.14, while the mean F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> among 2010 populations was 0.18, suggesting a possible decrease in gene flow and/or local effective population size. Rapidly changing genetic composition, reduced gene flow, and loss of haplotypes suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> is vulnerable to extinction.
