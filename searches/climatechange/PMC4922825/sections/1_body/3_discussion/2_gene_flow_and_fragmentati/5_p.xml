<p class="p">Our data join a small but growing body of data from studies seeking to understand the genetic effects of climate-change-induced glacier and snow loss on rare alpine macroinvertebrates. We found relatively low diversity within populations and high differentiation between populations of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>, which is indicative of low connectivity among populations. This suggests that the likelihood of recolonization and genetic rescue as a means to mitigate climate-change-induced threats is relatively limited in 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>. Our genetic data are also consistent with previous studies indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> will likely continue to experience increased fragmentation and isolation, and decreased population size, due to the ongoing loss of suitable cold water alpine streams driven by climate warming [

 <italic class="italic">Zapada glacier</italic>, a nemourid stonefly historically found throughout GNP in similar habitats to 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic>. This species has experienced a dramatic reduction in its occupied range in recent years [
