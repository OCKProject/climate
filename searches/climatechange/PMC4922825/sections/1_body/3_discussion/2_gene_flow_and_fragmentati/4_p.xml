<p class="p">The analyzed populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">californica</italic> were widely distributed across the western US, but nine were found within 50 km of each other in mountainous regions, conditions similar to those of our study. The mean 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> of these populations was 0.12, which was lower than the mean 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> value of 0.18 for all modern 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> populations (including the Grant Glacier basin population that is roughly 40 km south of the sampling core of this study). This suggests that genetic differentiation in 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> may be influenced by more than just terrain. These additional influences may include fragmentation associated with ice and snow loss and differing species vagility. Furthermore, although we only included three individuals from the Grant Glacier population, they carried two alleles not seen elsewhere, suggesting that over such scales 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> may be genetically divergent or diverging rapidly.
