 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> (Muhlfeld et al. 2011), and regional climate change are relevant to current proposals to list

 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. If listing occurs, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> could be the first invertebrate species listed as threatened or endangered due to climate change, and likely represents a guild of species facing similar threats in alpine headwaters worldwide.
