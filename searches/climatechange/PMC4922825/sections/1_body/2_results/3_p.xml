 </sub> values were all effectively zero for the within-stream comparisons along Lunch Creek, and very low at other locations. For example, the 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>

  <italic class="italic">st</italic>
 </sub> between the two Sexton populations (n = 15 and 18), which were separated by only 130 m, was 0.026, and was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05), meaning there was no population structure within streams. These results justified our approach of combining sampling locales within a few km of each other along the same creek or basin (e.g., for coarse-scale tests of population genetic subdivision).
