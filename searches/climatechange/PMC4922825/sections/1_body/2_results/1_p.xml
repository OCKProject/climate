<p class="p">We obtained 658 bp of COI data and 872 bp of CytB data from 77 and 109 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tumana</italic> individuals, respectively. The concatenated dataset had a total length of 1530 bp and 16 haplotypes. One of these haplotypes (LtA) was shared by 88 individuals, including many 2010 and historic samples. Each of the other 15 haplotypes differed from this dominant haplotype by only one substitution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157386.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), suggesting again that our sequences do not contain numts. The second-most-common haplotype (LtB) was shared by seven historic individuals (from 1997, 1998, and 2005) from two populations separated by ~9km, but was absent from 2010 samples. This haplotype differs from LtA by a third codon position substitution near the end of the CytB gene (AA 351/378:Valine). While none of the 2010 samples were collected from the identical locations that harbored LtB, extensive sampling was done in 2010 within three km of the LtB sites (at Lunch Creek, for example). Of the remaining haplotypes, one was carried by three individuals, five were carried by two individuals, and eight were carried by single individuals.
