<p class="p">Hybridisation is a widespread phenomenon in nature (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mallet, 2005</xref>). However, its frequency, diversity of outcomes, underlying mechanisms, its role in the evolutionary process, and how to deal with it in conservation biology have been controversial topics for more than a century (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arnold, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwenk, Brede &amp; Streit, 2008</xref>). Much of our knowledge about the link between hybridisation dynamics in animals and climate changes, comes from studies of hybrid zones (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hewitt, 2011</xref>), where the reshuffling of speciesâ€™ ranges in response to changing climates brought into contact closely related and previously allopatric species. Pre-mating reproductive barriers could be incomplete between these species, and their genomes could still be porous to introgression, with several far reaching implications (

 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arnold, 2006</xref>;

 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hewitt, 2011</xref>). Not surprisingly, species of ancient divergence and with a long-lasting history of sympatry have contributed the least to this body of knowledge (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mallet, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwenk, Brede &amp; Streit, 2008</xref>). These species have had ample opportunity to evolve strong pre-mating reproductive barriers, either as a by-product of a longer allopatric divergence or because of character displacement in response to natural selection (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pfennig &amp; Pfennig, 2009</xref>). Consequently, hybridisation events are extremely improbable between these species (e.g. 
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Proietti et al., 2014</xref>), and their observation incidental in the wild.
