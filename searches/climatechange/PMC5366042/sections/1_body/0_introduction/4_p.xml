<p class="p">Here, we combine our field observation with data from previous reports of similar hybridisation events for the 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes viridis</italic> groups in Europe along the last century, in order to study the causation of these ‘improbable’ events. To this end, we examined the contribution of multiple factors, including all those commonly invoked to explain novel interspecific hybridisations among animal species in the wild.
