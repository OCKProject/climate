<p class="p">To calibrate the models, we used the ensemble forecasting approach (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araújo &amp; New, 2007</xref>) implemented in BIOMOD, a bioclimatic niche modelling package for the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> environment (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thuiller et al., 2009</xref>). We used the following eight models: (i) generalised linear models; (ii) generalised additive models; (iii) classification tree analysis; (iv) artificial neural networks; (v) generalised boosted models; (vi) random forests; (vii) flexible discriminant analysis; and (viii) multivariate adaptive regression spline. All models were calibrated over the entirety of peninsular Italy south of the Po river (212,460 km

 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> collected before 2000, plus 10,000 background points (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" class="xref">Supplemental Information 1</xref>). All models were evaluated using a repeated split-plot procedure (70% of the data used for calibration, 30% left apart for evaluation; the entire procedure repeated 10 times for each model;

 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Swets, 1988</xref>). All models with AUC values greater than 0.7 (
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Swets, 1988</xref>) were projected over the entire study area using the 1950–2000, the 2007–2013, and the 2070–2100 climate layers. We measured the minimum probability of presence obtained in correspondence of the available points of presence for 1950–2000, and we used this threshold to define areas of species presence (all areas above this minimum threshold of probability) in all periods considered. Moreover, considering 100 m wide elevation classes, we calculated the elevation-specific average probability of presence for all three periods, and obtained a model of the probability of presence for
