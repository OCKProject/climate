<p class="p">We further investigated the plausibility of a link between climate change and altitudinal shifts by turning the model prediction into a working hypothesis. Based on the model results, we selected a geographic area close to our study site, and carried out field searches for further, unknown sites of occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic>, above 1,200 MASL. To select the geographic area, we adopted the following criteria: (i) location on a mountain massif, as close as possible to our study site; (ii) presence of potential breeding sites (e.g. ponds) at altitudes â‰¥1,200 MASL; (iii) presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> populations at lower elevations along the same mountain; and (iv) absence of obvious anthropogenic habitat discontinuities between low and high altitude areas. Accordingly, we identified the Picentini Mountains (within the Picentini Mountains Regional Park, roughly located 25 km south-east of our study site) as an area of best fit for our criteria. Field searches began on 2 May 2015, and lasted until the first evidence of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> in the area was found (21 May). The rationale underlying this experimental integration was as follows: although failure to identify new high-altitude sites of occurrence would not be strong evidence against a role of climate change in promoting altitudinal shifts at Lake Campo Maggiore or elsewhere, a positive result would provide support for the model prediction, and therefore support the hypothesis that our initial finding belongs to a suite of events promoted by climate change.
