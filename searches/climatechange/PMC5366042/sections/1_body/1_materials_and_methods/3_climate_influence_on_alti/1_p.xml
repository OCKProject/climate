<p class="p">Based on historical records of occurrence (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carpino &amp; Capasso, 2008</xref>), and considering the speciesâ€™ altitudinal distributions in peninsular Italy (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lanza et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guarino et al., 2012</xref>), the presence of a 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic> population at the study site was expected, whereas the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> was not expected, either at this site or within neighbouring, high-altitude areas. Therefore, we focused the following analyses on the latter.
