<p class="p">To address the plausibility of climate forcing on recent altitudinal distribution changes for 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic>, we calibrated a correlative species distribution model in peninsular Italy considering the presence of the species across the 21st century. Then we projected the distribution model to the current climate (average over 2007–2013) and to the future (average 2070–2100). The model was calibrated considering six bioclimatic variables theoretically important for the presence of the species: temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, temperature annual range, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. We obtained all climate variables at 1 km resolution from WORLDCLIM (

 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maiorano et al. (2013)</xref> and considered monthly temperature and precipitation values (spatial resolution equal to 50 × 50 km) from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (database: CRU TS3.22; 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). To downscale the CRU database to the 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the WORLDCLIM database, we first calculated climate anomalies by contrasting monthly temperature and precipitation values for 2007–2013 against the 1950–2000 climate data, as obtained from the same CRU TS3.22 database. Anomalies were calculated as absolute temperature difference (Δ°C) and relative precipitation differences (% change). By using bilinear resampling, we downscaled the anomalies to 0.0083° of spatial resolution (≈1 km). Then, in order to obtain monthly maps of temperature and precipitation for 2007–2013, we applied the anomaly corrections to the WORLDCLIM climate layers. Finally, we calculated all the derived climate maps mentioned above.
