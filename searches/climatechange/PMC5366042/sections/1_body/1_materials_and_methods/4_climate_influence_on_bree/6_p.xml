<p class="p">To test the null hypothesis that an association between hybridisation events and temperature anomalies was due to chance alone, we carried out binomial probability tests. We set the probability threshold of a single event to 0.02, based on the highest value calculated for the ratio between year rank (mildest = first rank) and climatic series length (i.e. the first out of 47 available years from the climatic station DA000030380). Since hybridisation events were both spatially and temporally distant, data independence was assumed. However, to err on the side of caution, we carried out the analyses considering the two observations in eastern Czech Republic, as both independent and fully dependent (i.e. as a single observation); then we took the highest value as the confidence level for accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis stated above.</p>
