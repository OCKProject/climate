<p class="p">The annual activity cycle of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic> populations can be affected by several environmental features, including climate, and the five sites (including our observation) span a wide range of latitudes. Thus, rather than considering average winter temperatures, we based our analysis on the period when this species begins its breeding activity in each area, according to regional atlases and databases (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilsen &amp; Kauri, 1959</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cabela, Grillitsch &amp; Tiedemann, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nečas, Modrý &amp; Zavadil, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guarino et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, previous studies suggested that the beginning of this activity is linked to the average temperatures of the preceding one to two months (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reading, 1998</xref>). Therefore, in our testing for a link between hybridisation events and climate anomalies, we set the period of interest to the two months preceding the usual start of the breeding activity, for each geographic area. Accordingly, we analysed date ranges covering December to January for the site in south-central Italy, January to February for the sites in Czech Republic and Austria, and February to March for the site in Sweden.
