<p class="p">Finally, the paucity of hybridisation events recorded qualifies these events as rare, and testifies to the strength of the pre-mating isolation mechanisms. On the other hand, given such rareness, we cannot exclude the occurrence of potentially unobserved, unreported, or undetected hybridisation events. Thus, we explored how potentially unknown events could affect the significance of our test. To this aim, we carried out additional binomial probability tests by progressively increasing the number of events while leaving the number of ‘successes’ unchanged. The null hypotheses of no association was rejected at the nominal probability threshold α = 0.05.</p>
