<p class="p">We sampled and carried to the laboratory a strip, approximately 1.5 m in length from the clutch laid by the hybrid pair on 10 May 2014. We visually searched for additional clues of hybridisation at the breeding pond for the subsequent 10 days. Although no further heterospecific pairs were observed, we collected and carried to the laboratory two additional egg-strings newly laid by unobserved parents. Fieldwork was approved by the Italian Ministry of Environment (permission number: 0042634, dated 7 August 2013).</p>
