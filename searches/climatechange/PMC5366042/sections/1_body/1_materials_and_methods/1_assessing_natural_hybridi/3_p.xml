<p class="p">Tadpoles of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> can be distinguished by larval morphology (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ambrogio &amp; Mezzadri, 2014</xref>) while hybrid tadpoles are usually heavily malformed (

 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1933</xref>). However, in order to achieve correct identification and to verify the absence of backcrosses between hybrids and parental individuals, we analysed genetic variation at the following allozyme loci: (i) malate dehydrogenase (Mdh-1 and Mdh-2; EC 1.1.1.37); (ii) isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icdh-1 and Icdh-2; EC 1.1.1.42); (iii) and malate dehydrogenase NADP+-dependent (Mdhp-1; EC 1.1.1.40). Fifty tadpoles from each egg-string were euthanised using a 200 mg/L solution of MS222, 10 days after hatching, and stored at −80 °C until subsequent analyses. The diagnostic value of each allozyme locus was verified through preliminary analyses of 20 individuals per species, sampled from two sites in neighbouring areas, where no evidence of potential hybridisation had been observed (

 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic>: 40.8866°N, 14.9318°E). Standard horizontal starch gel electrophoresis and zymogram visualisation were carried out, following previously published standard protocols (
