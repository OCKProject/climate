<p class="p">In order to confirm the hybrid nature of the egg-string laid by the heterospecific pair (against the hypotheses of unfertilised eggs and of undetected homospecific paternity) and to address the parental species of the other egg-strings, we monitored egg and tadpole development under laboratory conditions and analysed the pattern of variation of individual larvae at diagnostic genetic markers. Tadpoles were reared under standardised light and food conditions, in plastic boxes (0.8 × 0.5 × 0.2 m) filled with oxygenated tap water. Larval mortality was checked twice daily, from hatching to metamorphosis.</p>
