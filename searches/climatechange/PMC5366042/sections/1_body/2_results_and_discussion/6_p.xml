<p class="p">Anthropogenic habitat degradation has been proposed as a main causative agent in some case (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duda, 2008</xref>). By reducing the diversity and number of potential breeding sites in a given area, physical alterations of habitat could promote syntopy of previously allotopic populations. Although plausibly contributing, this hypothesis cannot explain the entire pattern, and it does not apply to all cases. Our study site (but see also 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zavadil &amp; Roth, 1997</xref>) is located within a protected area established in 1993, and an analysis of contemporary and historical aerial photos of this site and neighbouring areas clearly show the absence of any physical alterations of potential relevance for the two species (
