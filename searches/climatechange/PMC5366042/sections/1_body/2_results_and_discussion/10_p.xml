<p class="p">Our analyses do not indicate climate change as the single explanatory factor. The environmental contexts in which interspecific interactions occur, the diverse forms of habitat disturbance, or behavioural changes during altitudinal migrations (

 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014</xref>), and of the results of our modelling exercise, we hypothesise that these events will become progressively more common in the near future. Most importantly, our results reveal a wider potential influence of climate changes on interspecific reproductive interactions, particularly in the many instances where climate-driven asynchrony and/or allotopy are integral components of the reproductive isolating barriers.
