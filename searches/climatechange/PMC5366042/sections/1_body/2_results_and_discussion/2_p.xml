<p class="p">All tadpoles from the putatively hybrid egg-string were identified as first-generation hybrids by their heterozygote status at all loci analysed. In line with previous findings (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Montalenti, 1932</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1933</xref>), most of them were heavily malformed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), and none reached the metamorphosis. Instead, at all the loci analysed, tadpoles from the additional two clutches sampled at the breeding site were homozygotic for 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> diagnostic alleles, and were thus identified as belonging to this parental species. As expected, they did not show abnormalities, neither in the external morphology nor in the ontogenetic pathway.
