<p class="p">By promoting a recent altitudinal migration of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> from neighbouring, lower altitude sites, the ongoing climate warming engendered the unexpected syntopy at our study site. Support to this argument (the only alternative to recent translocation), comes from our models of the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> in peninsular Italy, based on a set of known occurrences collected before year 2000, and projected to the average climate over the period 2007–2013. Indeed, our models indicated that the species’ presence above 1,200 MASL was highly improbable under pre-2000 climate, but became plausible during 2007–2013 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The reliability of the models was clearly confirmed by the field-validation procedure (see Materials and Methods). Indeed, our field searches of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> at high-altitude sites of predicted presence in post-2000 projections were successful. We found a previously unreported site of occurrence within the Picentini Mountains (latitude: 40.8251°N; longitude: 14.9864°E; roughly 25 km south-east of the study site), thus confirming that upward migrations of 
 <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic> are ongoing, as predicted by our bioclimatic model (see also
