<p class="p">Although 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic> is expected to bring forward its breeding activity after mild winters (

 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tryjanowski, Rybacki &amp; Sparks, 2003</xref>), at least three lines of support may help explaining this apparently counter-intuitive pattern. In years, when the breeding season begins earlier (after a mild winter), breeding has been observed to last longer (

 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reading, 1998</xref>). Finally, extensive ecophysiological investigations on bufonid toads, including 
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic>, indicate that increased temperatures during hibernation lead to significant alterations of several processes affecting the breeding activity, including body size condition, annual ovarian cycle, and seasonal synchronisation of breeding (
