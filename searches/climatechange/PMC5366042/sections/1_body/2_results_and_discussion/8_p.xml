<p class="p">Besides being a co-factor for syntopy, climate changes also contributed to the hybridisation events by promoting an overlap of the breeding activities. Analysing long-term climate series, we found that the years when hybridisation events were recorded in Europe (including our observation) ranked first or second hottest on record at most sites, over time series from 47 to 214 years long. Moreover, bimonthly mean temperatures at these sites were 2.4 °C to 5.5 °C above the 1961–1990 averages, and 1.9 °C to 4.3 °C above the preceding 10 years averages (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 2.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>). Also, additional binomial probability tests, carried out in order to explore how unrecorded events could affect the significance of our test, indicated that the null hypothesis of random association was rejected (at 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05) until the number of events was ≥77, while leaving unchanged the number of ‘successes’.
