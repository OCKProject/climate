  <title class="title">Climate correlates of the interspecific hybridisation events observed in the wild between species of the common toad (

  <p class="p">Bar plots showing frequency distribution (%) of bimonthly mean temperature deviations (Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic>
   <sub class="sub">m</sub>) from the 1961–1990 average, compared to the two months preceding the breeding activity at each geographic region: (A) December to January (Italy, this study), (B) February to March (Sweden, 
   <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lang, 1926</xref>), and (C–E) January to February (Czech Republic, 
   <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vlček, 1995</xref>, 
   <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>, 
   <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zavadil &amp; Roth, 1997</xref>, respectively). Values for the years when hybrid mates were observed are marked using red arrows. Optimal bar width was computed for each climatic series following the Freedman–Diaconis rule. (F) Average probability of presence vs elevation at sea level (m) as modelled for the pre-2000 climate (red line), the 2007–2013 climate (solid black line), and the 2070–2010 climate (blue line); the black dotted line indicates the minimum plausible level of probability of presence, above which the species can be considered present, while below is considered absent. (G) Mean temperature data for each site, and year of observation of interspecific mates. CsL, climatic series length, in years, before the observed event; b-MT, bimonthly mean temperature; R, rank over the entire climatic series (1 = mildest); Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic>
   <sub class="sub">m</sub>, deviation from the 1961–1990 average temperature (°C); Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic>
   <sub class="sub">10y</sub>, deviation from the preceding 10 year average temperature (°C).
