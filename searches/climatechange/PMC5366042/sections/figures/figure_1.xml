  <title class="title">Interspecific hybridisation between the common toad (
   <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic>) and the green toad (
   <italic class="italic">Bufotes balearicus</italic>) in the wild.
  </title>
  <p class="p">The hybrid pair (A) was found spawning (B) on 10 May 2014, at Lake Campo Maggiore, a high-elevation pond within the Partenio Regional Park, Southern Italy (latitude: 40.9429°N; longitude: 14.7096°E; altitude: 1,330 MASL). The majority of tadpoles from the hybrid egg-string reared under standard laboratory conditions were heavily malformed (inset), and none survived until metamorphosis; this pattern was not observed for control tadpoles from con-specific matings.
