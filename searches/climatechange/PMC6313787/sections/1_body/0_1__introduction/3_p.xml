<p class="p">Chaohu Lake, located in southeast China, is a typical shallow lake located in the lower reach of the Changjiang River. In the last century, the water quality, trophic level, and ecological structure in the lake has experienced a dramatic change under enhanced human activities such as deforestation, changing of the tillage system, urbanization, and damming [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], but variations in carbon and nitrogen burial and the driving factors from human activity and climate change remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the temporal variability of carbon and nitrogen burial rates from two sediment cores in Chaohu Lake. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the temporal variability of carbon and nitrogen burial rates of Chaohu Lake, (2) to identify the change of organic matter sources, and (3) to analyze the driving factors for carbon and nitrogen burial rates.
