<p class="p">Organic matter in sediment is from a mixture of different sources. The atomic ratio of C/N in sediment has been widely utilized to identify the different sources of organic matter in lake sediments [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. As the atomic ratios of C/N are characterized with distinctive values for autochthonous sources (3 to 8) and allochthonous sources (&gt;20), the vertical variation of the C/N ratio can be used to reflect the change in the relative contribution proportion from these two sources [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. A decrease of C/N with depth suggests that sediments receive a higher proportion from autochthonous sources. Conversely, an increase of C/N indicates a higher proportion from terrestrial organic matter input [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The C/N ratios at the ECH and WCH varied from 6.13 to 10.19 with a decreasing trend from the bottom to top (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), which indicates an increasing organic matter proportion from autochthonous source. The binary mixing model, which was introduced by Qian [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], was applied to quantitatively identify the contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter sources. This model is a zero-order approximation model that uses the content of TOC and TN and C/N ratio to estimate the contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon and has been widely used in source analysis [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The results showed that the organic matter originating from these two sources was close for both the ECH and WCH before the 1970s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The autochthonous source showed an increasing trend and became the dominant source since the 1970s, which is consistent with previous study in Chaohu Lake [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and Taihu Lake [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The decreasing contribution from terrestrial sources could be attributed to the construction of reservoirs within the Chaohu Lake watershed. To ensure the security of drinking and irrigation water, a great number of reservoirs such as the Longhekou Reservoir and Dongpu Reservoir have been built since the 1950s, meaning that less terrestrial organic matter enters into the lake.
