<p class="p">Moreover, early diagenesis after sedimentation may have a potential influence on the isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. For the isotopes, light carbon (
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>C) and nitrogen (
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>N) in organic matter will preferentially mineralize during early diagenesis, potentially resulting in the enrichment of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N. Previous study showed that early diagenesis-caused isotopic fractionation was under detection for δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N in lake sediment [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In this study, the values of δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N were relatively stable in the downward sediment layers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>d,e). This indicates that early diagenetic-caused isotopic change was insignificant in the sedimentary organic matter for Chaohu Lake. Furthermore, nitrogen in organic matter was preferentially degraded when compared to carbon, which could lead to the increase of the C/N ratio [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For the values before the 1970s, the C/N had no significant oscillation for both the ECH and WCH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), indicating that early diagenesis had no significant influence on the C/N ratio in Chaohu Lake. Therefore, the geochemical proxies of sediment can be effectively used to reflect environment change in Chaohu Lake.
