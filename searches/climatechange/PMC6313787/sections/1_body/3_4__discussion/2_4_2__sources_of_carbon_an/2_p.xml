 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C ranged from −25.0 to −21.9‰, indicating that organic matter in sediment was a mixture of terrestrial plants and allochthonous phytoplankton. Prior to the 1970s, the values (−22.3 ± 0.40‰ for the ECH and −22.1 ± 0.80‰ for the WCH) were relatively enriched, suggesting a higher contribution from terrestrial sources. However, the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values had presented a continuous decreasing trend with a depletion of 1.5 to 3.0‰ since the 1970s. This suggests that an increase of primary productivity in the lake has yielded a decrease of δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C in organic matter and was further buried in sediment with increasing TOC content and a decreasing C/N ratio. In spite of this, the close δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values further indicated that organic matter sources were similar for the eastern and western Chaohu Lake.
