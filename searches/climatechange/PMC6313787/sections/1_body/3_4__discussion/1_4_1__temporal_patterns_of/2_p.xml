<p class="p">The distribution of carbon and nitrogen burial rates showed significant spatial heterogeneity in Chaohu Lake. In the pre-1970s period, despite the differences in the sedimentation rates between the ECH and WCH being relatively higher, there was no significant difference between the ECH and WCH for both the organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a,b). This could be attributed to the close content of carbon and nitrogen in the sediment. Since the 1970s, the burial rates at the WCH were about 1.37 and 1.48 times that at the ECH for organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The DMAR between these two sites showed no difference (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a,b).This indicates that the site-dependent variability of burial rates was primarily driven by differences in the carbon and nitrogen contents. Since the 1970s, with rapid socio-economic development, nutrient loading originating from industrial wastewater, agriculture fertilization, and domestic sewage have been accelerated in the Chaohu Lake watershed [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. This has led to a considerable amount of nutrients entering Chaohu Lake from the rivers [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], which first enter the western lake [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Such enrichment has significantly promoted TN, total phosphorus (TP) concentration and primary productivity in the overlying water in the western Chaohu Lake [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Besides this, the TP content in sediment varied from 0.400 to 0.533 mg P g

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (with an average 0.772 mg P g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) for the ECH and WCH, respectively, showing an increasing trend from the bottom to the top for both cores (unpublished data). The storage of phosphorus could be released to the overlying water [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], which can promote the primary productivity and further promote the carbon and nitrogen burial rates in the sediment.
