<p class="p">Socio-economic development has also been an important controlling factor in organic carbon burial rates in lakes [

 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In the Chaohu Lake watershed, population and GDP have experienced a continuous increase during the last few decades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>), with about 2.54 million people and 0.51 billion Yuan in 1952 and 6.61 million people and 557.0 billion Yuan in 2016. To meet the needs of agricultural development, chemical fertilizer usage has shown a steady increasing trend before the 1970s and a rapidly increasing trend since the 1980s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). As a result, a substantial quantity of nutrient originating from agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater and domestic sewage has been discharged into Chaohu Lake. In addition, human activities such as deforestation, cultivation pattern changes, mining, and urbanization could be contributors to nutrient export. The enrichment of nutrients has consequently promoted primary production in the lake as well as organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates in sediment.
