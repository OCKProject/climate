<p class="p">The results of the PCA show that the first and second principal component (PC) can explain a large extent of variance of the driving factors (over 99.9%). PC1 is most related to chemical fertilizer usage (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), which indicates that chemical fertilizer usage was the predominant driving factor for carbon and nitrogen burial in Chaohu Lake. PC2 is associated with precipitation and discharge of the Chaohu Dam, which represents a natural driving force. The positive coefficients mean that an increase of precipitation can result in more organic carbon and nitrogen burial in sediment, which can be referred to the enhanced nutrient amount from the terrestrial ecosystem. Further, PC1 and PC2 was used to establish a multiple linear regression with organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates. The equations for organic carbon can be expressed as:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">y = 15.10 + 0.0000292 PC1 + 0.00404 PC2 R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.48, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0102
  <label class="label">(7)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">y = 23.03 + 0.0000799 PC1 − 0.00133 PC2 R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.88, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001
  <label class="label">(8)</label>
 </disp-formula> for ECH and WCH, respectively. For nitrogen:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">y = 2.69 + 0.00000487 PC1 + 0.000380 PC2 R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.47, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0110
  <label class="label">(9)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">y = 3.96 + 0.0000141 PC1 − 0.000201 PC2 R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.87, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001
  <label class="label">(10)</label>
 </disp-formula> for ECH and WCH, respectively, where, y is the burial rate of organic carbon or nitrogen, PC1 is the first principal component, and PC2 is the second principal component. The regression relationship (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) at WCH is higher than at ECH, which can confirm that the western Chaohu Lake is more susceptible to environmental change than the eastern Chaohu Lake.
