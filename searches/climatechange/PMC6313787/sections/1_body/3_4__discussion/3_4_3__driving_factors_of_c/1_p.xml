<p class="p">The increasing trend of carbon and nitrogen burial rates in lakes has been confirmed by previous studies, which are driven by natural and artificial factors [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Temperature is one of the most important driving factors. Rising temperature can lead to the promotion of nutrient release from sediments [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] and phytoplankton productivity in lakes [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in temperature can also accelerate organic matter decomposition and reduce burial rates in sediment [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. This shows that temperature has a negative effect on organic carbon burial rates in sediment under experimental treatment conditions [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, regional scale studies revealed that increasing temperature could lead to more carbon being buried in sediment [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The annual air temperature showed an increasing trend with 15.8 °C in 1953 to 16.6 °C in 2016 in Chaohu Lake (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). The air temperature showed a positive relationship with the carbon and nitrogen burial rates (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that warming-caused organic carbon and nitrogen burial was greater than the decomposition in sediment, and that warming was an important driving factor for the organic carbon and nitrogen burial rate in Chaohu Lake.
