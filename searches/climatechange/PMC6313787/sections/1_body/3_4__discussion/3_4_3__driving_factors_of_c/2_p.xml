<p class="p">Precipitation has a positive influence on the organic carbon burial rates in lakes by carrying terrestrial organic carbon and flushing nutrients into lakes [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In the Chaohu Lake watershed, precipitation has shown no significant variation since the 1950s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>) and had a less direct influence on the carbon and nitrogen burial rates in the lake (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, this does not mean that precipitation had no effect on the burial rates. Intensive human activities have a strong effect on the burial rates in sediment, which can weaken the effect of precipitation on the burial rates in lakes [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and can make the effect not real [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Previous study has shown that precipitation has an important role in regulating the carbon burial rates in less disturbed watersheds by human activities [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Indeed, precipitation-controlled inter-annual and/or inner-annual drier and wetter conditions can greatly alter organic matter and nutrient export from the terrestrial system [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Intensive precipitation can flush a considerable quantity of nutrients into lakes [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], which can further promote primary production. Therefore, the change of temporal precipitation patterns can indirectly promote the burial rate of organic carbon and nitrogen in sediment.
