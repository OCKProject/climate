After the construction of the Chaohu Dam in 1962, Chaohu Lake turned into a man-controlled reservoir with low water level fluctuation throughout the year. The change of water level had a direct influence on the ecological structure in the lake, leading to the disappearance of submerged vegetation and the appearance of algal bloom [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-02734" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. There was a significantly positive relationship of water level with the carbon and nitrogen burial rates in Chaohu Lake (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), indicating that water level had an important role in controlling the organic carbon and nitrogen burial rate. The change of hydrological condition also led to a dramatic reduction in the annual water exchange volume between Chaohu Lake and the Changjiang River, which decreased from 13.6 × 10
