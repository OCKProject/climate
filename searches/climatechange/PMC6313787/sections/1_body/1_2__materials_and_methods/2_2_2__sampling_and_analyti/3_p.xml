<p class="p">Total organic carbon (TOC) was tested by an element analyzer (Vario MICRO cube, Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany) after removing the inorganic carbon by adding HCl. The total nitrogen (TN) of untreated sediment samples was measured by an element analyzer (Vario MICRO cube, Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany). Sediment samples for C and N isotope compositions in organic matter were pretreated with 1 M HCl to remove inorganic carbon, followed by centrifugation, rinsing with deionized water to obtain a neutral pH condition, then dried at 60 °C for 4 h. The isotope ratios were determined by a Finnigan MAT 253 mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Ringoes, NJ, USA) equipped with a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Ringoes, NJ, USA). The isotopic compositions of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N were expressed in δ and expressed as per mill (‰) relative to the standard of Pee Dee Belemnite and atmospheric N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N, respectively.
