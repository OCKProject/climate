<p class="p">In October 2016, two sediment cores located at the eastern lake (ECH, 117°36′14.38″ E, 31°31′28.92″ N) and western lake (WCH, 117°22′20.49″ E, 31°37′50.59″ N) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) were collected using gravity sampling cores that were 28 cm and 29 cm in length, respectively. The general characteristics of these two cores are presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02734-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The sediment cores were sliced into 1 cm subsamples in situ and kept frozen by a portative cooler. After being taken to the laboratory, the samples were weighed wet, freeze-dried, then reweighed to calculate the dry bulk density.
