<p class="p">Sedimentary chronology was determined using the 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb radiometric dating method. The radionuclides (
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb, 
 <sup class="sup">226</sup>Ra and 
 <sup class="sup">137</sup>Cs) were measured for 40,000 s (live time) using well-type coaxial gamma ray spectrometers equipped with a high purity germanium detection (GWL-120-10, ORTEC, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) and a digital signal processing gamma ray spectrometer (DSPEC jr 2.0, ORTEC, Oak Ridge, TN, USA). Before testing, each sample was sealed in a container for over three weeks to ensure radioactive equilibration.
