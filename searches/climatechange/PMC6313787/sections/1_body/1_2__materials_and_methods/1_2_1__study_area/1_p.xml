<p class="p">Chaohu Lake (30°59′ N–32°06′ N, 116°24′ E–118°00′ E) is one of the five largest freshwater lakes in China and is located in the lower reaches of the Changjiang River (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and a surface area of 783 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The entire watershed is located in the temperate monsoon climate zone, with an annual mean temperature of 15.5 °C and precipitation of 1000 mm. Chaohu Lake can be divided into two regions by a line crossing Zhongmiao Temple and Mushan Island: the eastern lake (about one third of its surface area) and western lake (about two thirds of its surface area). The Nanfei River and Hangbu River, covering more than 60% of the entire watershed, are the two largest rivers that discharge into the western lake. The Yuxi River is the only outflow river linking to the Changjiang River. Prior to the construction of the Chaohu Dam in 1962, the water of Chaohu Lake could naturally exchange with the water of the Changjiang River. Since then, Chaohu Lake has become a man-controlled reservoir-lake.
