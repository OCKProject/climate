<p class="p">The changes in climate and human activities have a direct influence on nutrient export from terrestrial ecosystems. The change in climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation, and social development factors such as damming, chemical fertilizer usage, human population, and economy were analyzed as driving factors for the carbon or nitrogen burial rates. Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed data were collected from national meteorological stations (

The water level and discharge of the Chaohu Dam was culled from Annual Hydrological Report, China (Hydrological Data of Changjiang River Basin). Chemical fertilizer usage, GDP (gross domestic product), and population were calculated from county level data based on an area within the Chaohu Lake watershed, which was collected from the Anhui statistical yearbook (1988–2016,

Correlation coefficients between these factors and organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates were calculated. The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were developed to obtain the regression equation between these factors and burial rates. PCA can extract variable information from a set of correlated variables of observations into uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs), which was performed by the built-in
