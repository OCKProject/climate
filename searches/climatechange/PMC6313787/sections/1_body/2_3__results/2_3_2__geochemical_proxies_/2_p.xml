<p class="p">The vertical distribution of the C/N molar ratios at two sediment cores presented similar characters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02734-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), showing a decreasing trend from the bottom to the top for both cores. The ratios ranged from 6.79 to 9.93 and from 6.13 to 10.19 for the ECH and WCH, respectively. Unlike the TOC and TN content, the C/N ratio showed no significant difference between the ECH and WCH for both periods of pre-1970s and post-1970s.
