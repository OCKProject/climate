<p class="p">Geochemical proxies in sediments were used to analyze the temporal changes of organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates as well as the driving factors over the last 150 years in Chaohu Lake. The results showed that carbon and nitrogen burial rates varied from 3.98 to 31.47 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and from 0.47 to 5.66 g N m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. The burial rates in the western lake were higher than those in the eastern lake. The average burial rates of the entire lake after the 1970s were about 1.98 and 2.53 times higher than the rates before the 1970s for carbon and nitrogen, respectively, indicating accelerated burial rates. The increase in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values and a decrease in the C/N ratio indicated that primary productivity in the lake was the main organic matter source, and the increasing δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N values suggest enhanced nutrient loading from Hefei City since the 1970s. The increase of organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates was positively dependent on climate factors and socio-economic development, which indicates that accelerating rates of organic carbon and nitrogen will accumulate in the Chaohu Lake sediment in the future.
