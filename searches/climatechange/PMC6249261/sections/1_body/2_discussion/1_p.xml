<p id="Par9" class="p">The plant pathogenic taxa detected in the middens displayed a range of different responses during the CAPE. Some taxa exhibited no significant difference in occurrence frequency or abundance between middens deposited during or outside the pluvial events, while others appeared to increase in abundance and/or occur at higher frequencies during the CAPE. These varying responses indicate that different taxa were responding to different climatic or biological drivers. Pucciniaceae appeared to be the taxon most influenced by the CAPE, exhibiting significant increases in both frequency of occurrence and relative abundance in middens deposited during the CAPE (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We suggest that there are three potential explanations for the response of this taxon. First, an increase in local plant diversity during the pluvial event may have resulted in an increase in the abundance of preferential host species. Second, the actual prevalence of the pathogenic taxon may have increased directly as a response to a change to more favourable climatic conditions. Third, an increase in plant density during the pluvial event may have driven a landscape-level increase in local plant pathogen abundance.
