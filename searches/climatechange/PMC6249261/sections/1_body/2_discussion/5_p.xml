 </sup>, our study reports the oldest DNA sequences so far recovered for plant pathogens. None of the plant pathogenic taxa detected in the middens were particularly common (all except Dothideomycetes occurred at &lt;1% of total reads per midden), emphasising the importance of high-throughput sequencing for detecting and studying these organisms in environmental samples. Further insights, particularly around confirming the pathogenic status of present taxa, could be gained by the application of taxon-specific barcoding primers that can utilise more complete reference sequence databases and provide improved taxonomic resolution (e.g. ITS for fungi, 16S for bacteria). Moreover, shotgun sequencing could also provide information on viral pathogens within such samples
