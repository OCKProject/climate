<p id="Par10" class="p">Higher plant diversity observed during pluvial events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) indicates that the first explanation may have some credence. Many genera within the Pucciniacae are known to occur widely on grasses (e.g.

 </sup>. However, the patterns demonstrated in our data show that there was no (or very weak) correlation of the relative abundance of Poaceae/Asteraceae and Pucciniaceae reads in our samples. Furthermore, abundant DNA reads of Poaceae/Asteraceae were present in several middens that were either younger or older than the CAPE, yet Pucciniaceae was rare in these samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Together, these data indicate stronger support for the second explanation, i.e. that climate had a direct effect on Pucciniaceae abundance, and not just an indirect effect via changes in the plant community composition. Presumably this direct effect was driven by increased moisture availability, as Pucciniaceae

 </sup> species are known to benefit from increases in precipitation frequency and/or humidity (e.g. through increased survival of mycelia in plant tissues, increased spore release and higher atmospheric spore concentrations). These kinds of favourable climatic conditions prevailed in the Atacama Desert during the CAPE, when Pucciniaceae read abundance was correlated with the abundance of preferred hosts. However, during less favourable drier periods Pucciniaceae was rare, irrespective of the abundance of preferred hosts. Soil DNA evidence suggests that Puccinaceae are present but very rare in the driest parts of the Atacama Desert today
