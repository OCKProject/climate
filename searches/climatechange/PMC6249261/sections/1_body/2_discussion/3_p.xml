<p id="Par11" class="p">Despite the evidence for direct climatic influences, density-dependent effects (the third explanation) are difficult to rule out, as the selective and highly localized collection and concentration of plant macrofossils in rodent middens makes the actual density of local vegetation communities difficult to resolve. Pollen analyses of middens more generally reflect the local and regional vegetation at the elevation of the midden and have been suggested to provide a more accurate reconstruction of plant density surrounding the midden sites

 </sup> and therefore may provide a tool for examining density-dependent effects. However, we found no clear correlation between pathogen abundance and total pollen concentration, nor between Pucciniaceae abundance and Poaceae/Asteraceae pollen concentration (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). This is indicative that the density of plants on the landscape did not play an important role in determining pathogen abundance and lends more support to climate being the main driver.
