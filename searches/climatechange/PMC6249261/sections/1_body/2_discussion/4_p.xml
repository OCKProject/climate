<p id="Par12" class="p">While Pucciniaceae appears to have been significantly affected by CAPE in the central Atacama Desert, other putative plant pathogenic taxa were not affected to the same extent. Although maximum relative abundances for five of these taxa occurred in middens deposited during CAPE, there were no significant differences in the abundance or occurrence frequency of these taxa between CAPE and non-CAPE middens (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). There may be a range of explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that that the specific environmental or climatic factors driving changes in abundance and distribution may differ between taxa, and some of these drivers (e.g. mean temperature) might have not changed as markedly during CAPE as others (e.g. precipitation). Host-jumping e.g.

 </sup> is another process that could affect an observed pattern of plant pathogen abundance over long time periods and potentially mask climatic influences.
