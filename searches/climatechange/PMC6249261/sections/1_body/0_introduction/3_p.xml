 </sup>, such as pathogens. Here, we use ancient DNA to provide the first long-term late Quaternary record of plant pathogens. Specifically, we use 18S metabarcoding to examine the prevalence and relative abundance of eukaryotic plant pathogenic taxa (fungi and oomycetes) in 28 fossil rodent middens from the central Atacama Desert (~22–24° S latitude, 68–69 W° longitude) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), spanning from 200–49,600 radiocarbon years in age. Rodent middens are concentrated deposits of biotic material, mostly vegetation remains and coprolites, cemented together by crystallized urine and typically represent a non-selective sample

 </sup>. Individual middens likely represent accumulation periods of months to decades, and therefore record brief snapshots of prehistoric ecosystems

 </sup>. When deposited in dry crevices or caves rodent middens can be preserved for tens of thousands of years, making them an ideal resource for studying the effects of late Quaternary climate change on biological communities. Importantly, the temporal spread of our sampled rodent middens spans the Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE), a period of increased precipitation coinciding with the last glacial-interglacial transition, allowing us to test the response of plant pathogens to this major climate change event. For our purposes we treat the CAPE as a single event, although it actually consisted of two wet phases separated by a brief dry period. The wet phases are CAPE I (17.5–14.2 ka [calibrated years before present]), caused by a period of increased La Niña-like conditions in the central Pacific

 </sup>. Most of the middens analysed here come from the upper margin of the Atacama’s Absolute Desert, a largely plant-less landscape where mean annual rainfall &lt;10 mm/yr and a region where there has been major changes in plant community composition over the last 45,000 years

 </sup>. Increases in precipitation during the CAPE (and possibly lower temperatures during CAPE I) drove many plant species 500 to 1000 m downslope, enriching local xerophytic communities especially with species from the Poaceae, Asteraceae and Solanaceae families
