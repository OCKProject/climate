<p id="Par2" class="p">The potential for future climate change to alter the distribution and prevalence of plant pathogens is a topic that has received extensive attention in scientific literature

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>), yet there has also been significant interest in the increased risk for invasive pathogens to affect native vegetation communities

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Modelling, based on the climatic preferences of pathogenic species, currently underpins most predictions about the likely responses of plant pathogens to different climate change scenarios e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. However, there is an increasing appreciation for the contribution that long-term records can make to testing modelled predictions about biological responses to climate change
