<p id="Par15" class="p">Twenty-eight rodent middens from three discrete localities bordering the Salar de Atacama basin (2300 m above sea level) in the Antofagasta region of the central Atacama Desert, northern Chile (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), were used in this study. Twenty-four middens ranging from 200 to 49,600 radiocarbon years in age were analysed from Cerros de Aiquina (~22° 21′ S, 68° 18′ W) (2967–3355 m above sea level). Three middens ranging from 3,305 to 18,100 radiocarbon years in age were analysed from Lomas de Tilocalar (~23° 55′ S, 68° 10′ W) (2872–2893 m above sea level). A single midden dating to 23,430 radiocarbon years was analysed from Vegas de Tilocalar (~23° 44′ S, 68° 6′ W) (2414 m above sea elevel). Radiocarbon dates for the middens were calibrated using ShCal13
