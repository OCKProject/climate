 </sup> using a minimum LCA score of 50.0 and parsing to matches within 5% of the top score. Comparison of OTUs derived from individual PCRs demonstrated a good level of reproducibility (accounting for differences in sequencing depth), and in all cases the most abundant OTU in each of the triplicate PCRs was the same and the relative abundance of OTUs was reasonably consistent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). On this basis, results from the triplicate libraries for each midden were combined. As a further quality control step, sequences attributed to plant pathogenic taxa were again aligned against the NCBI nucleotide database using BLAST, this time returning the nearest 500 matches. These were examined manually to assess whether the taxonomic assignments provided by MEGAN remained robust alongside the higher number of nearest matches (allowing us to explore: 1) saturation of the top 50 matches by taxa with high numbers of GenBank sequences; and 2) high % identity scores outside the nearest 50 matches).
