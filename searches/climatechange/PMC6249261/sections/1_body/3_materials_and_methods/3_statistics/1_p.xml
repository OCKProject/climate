 </sup> was implemented using the brglm2 package in R. Models were run for each taxa separately. Differences in the mean relative abundance were tested using Welch’s two sample t-test (one-sided), which is robust to unequal variances. Mean abundance was quantified relative to total DNA reads rather than total plant pathogen reads. In all cases we tested for a difference between CAPE (17.5–8.5 ka) and non-CAPE periods (&lt;8.5 ka and &gt;17.5 ka). Analyses were repeated with the 49,600 yr old midden excluded (due to it being a temporal outlier compared with other middens) but no differences were observed.
