<p id="Par6" class="p">There appears to be no clear distinction of CAPE and non-CAPE middens based on the composition of the plant pathogen assemblages identified by our metabarcoding primers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, there was clearer discrimination between CAPE and non-CAPE middens for other assemblage-level metrics. For example, the highest richness of plant pathogenic taxa and highest total relative abundance of plant pathogenic reads were observed in midden samples deposited during the CAPE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), and plant pathogen richness was significantly greater in CAPE middens than non-CAPE middens (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
