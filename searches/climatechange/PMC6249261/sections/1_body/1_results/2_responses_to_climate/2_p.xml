<p id="Par7" class="p">For individual plant pathogenic taxa, distinct patterns in occurrence and abundance were observed that corresponded to the CAPE. The highest relative abundances for six of the nine taxa (
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic>, Pucciniaceae, Ustilaginomycotina, Dothideomycetes, 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium</italic>) were recorded in middens deposited during the CAPE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Pucciniaceae was significantly more abundant in middens deposited during the CAPE and occurred more frequently in middens deposited during the CAPE compared to those deposited earlier or later than the CAPE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic> were only detected in middens deposited during the CAPE (Table
