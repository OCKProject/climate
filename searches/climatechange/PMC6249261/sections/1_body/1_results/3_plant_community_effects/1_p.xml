 </sup>. As our metabarcoding primers also amplified plant DNA, we were able to examine the correlation between the relative abundances of Pucciniaceae vs. Poaceae and Asteraceae reads in the midden samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The overall linear correlation of the relative abundance of Pucciniaceae vs Poaceae and Asteraceae reads was very weak and not significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.05, p = 0.251 and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = &lt; 0.01, p = 0.97 respectively), and the strength of the positive relationships only marginally increased for samples deposited during CAPE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.14, p = 0.253 and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.08, p = 0.399 respectively). Both Poaceae and Asteraceae reads were obtained at relatively high abundances in several non-CAPE middens, yet Pucciniaceae reads were rare in the same samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The relative abundance of Pucciniaceae reads also increased with increasing plant diversity (at family-level) (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.39, p = 0.06) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), yet higher plant diversity was also observed during CAPE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
