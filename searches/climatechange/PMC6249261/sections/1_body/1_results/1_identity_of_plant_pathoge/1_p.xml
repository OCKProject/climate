<p id="Par5" class="p">Short read lengths typically restrict taxonomic resolution and therefore limit the ability to make specific inferences about the ecology of identified taxa. However our analyses resolved six taxa within the middens that belong to groups that only include obligate plant pathogens. Three were oomycetes genera: 
 <italic class="italic">Albugo</italic> (100% identity to 
 <italic class="italic">Albugo</italic> spp., next nearest 94%), 
 <italic class="italic">Hyaloperonospora</italic> (100–98% identity to 
 <italic class="italic">Hyaloperonospora</italic>, next nearest 94%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium</italic> (100% identity to 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium</italic> spp., other 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium</italic> spp. 96% and lower), and three were fungal: Pucciniaceae, or rust fungi (100% identity only to taxa within this family), Ustilaginomycotina, or smut fungi (includes sequences with 100% identities to 
 <italic class="italic">Tilletia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Moniliella</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ustilago</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium culmorum</italic> (100% identity, other 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. have mismatches). Three additional fungal taxa identified from the middens include high proportions of plant pathogenic species: 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora</italic> (98–96% identity to some 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora</italic> spp., other 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. spp. and genera lower), 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic> (98% identity to 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic>, next closest 95%) and Dothideomycetes (100% identities dominated by pathogenic taxa within Capnodiales, particularly Mycosphaerellaceae, and Botryosphaeriaceae). As we could not resolve any taxa to species-level we could not be unequivocal about the pathogenic status of the identified taxa. However, we refer to these nine taxa hereafter as plant pathogenic taxa with this caveat in mind. DNA sequences attributed to the nine taxa (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) were recovered from 18 (64.3%) of the middens.
