<p class="p">The raw BAI averaged by population over the entire period (absolute meanBAI
 <sub class="sub">1993–2014</sub>, type A trait), expressed as a function of MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>, exhibited a second‐order curve (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">p</sub> of the population that had the highest growth performance was 6.6°C, which is higher than the MAT in the Valcartier common garden experiment (3.95°C). Populations from both warmer and colder provenances exhibited lower growth. No significant relationship was observed between absolute avDens

 <sub class="sub">p</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). However, note that the two populations from the southern group have a much higher tree‐ring density (Fig.
