<p class="p">The annotation of the 12 candidate SNPs confirmed in this study revealed a good match with the known functions of homologous genes in other plant models (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="nph14968-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Eight SNPs were located in coding regions and three were located in a noncoding region (intron). Among those located in coding regions, three SNPs were identified as synonymous and five were identified as nonsynonymous. All the putative gene products had functions ranging from transcription factor activity to regulation of signaling molecules.
