 <xref rid="nph14968-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>): three SNPs (three genes) were significantly associated with dendrometric traits DBH

 <sub class="sub">21</sub>, while 11 SNPs (nine genes) were associated with tree‐ring traits (types A, B and C). As many as 10 SNPs (eight genes) were associated with the climate‐related type B and type C traits (seven SNP–trait associations classified as very likely, five likely and eight uncertain). Traits reflecting responses to specific freezing events (BAI
