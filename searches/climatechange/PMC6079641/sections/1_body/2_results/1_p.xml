<p class="p">High variability was observed for annual averages of raw‐absolute BAI among

 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). Globally, time‐series of population‐averaged standardized residual BAI scores were well intercorrelated; the mean of the pairwise correlations was 0.66. Yet, the values of these pairwise correlations tended to be higher when computed between provenances that had smaller geographic distances (Mantel test observed correlation
