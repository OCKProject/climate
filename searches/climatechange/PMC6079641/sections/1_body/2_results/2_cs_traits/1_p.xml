<p class="p">Analysis of interannual variability of population‐averaged standardized residual BAI and density scores in relation to climatic fluctuations enables the identification of climatic constraints acting upon ring formation. The coefficients of correlation between growth metrics and the climatic variables hereafter constitute the CS traits (type C; Figs 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; see Figs 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref> for response function analyses). The positive influence of a lengthening of the growing season on BAI was made evident by the positive correlations between population averages of standardized residual BAI scores (1993–2010) and October temperatures during the autumn of the year preceding ring formation (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Temp.Oct
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t−</italic>1)
 </sub>), and with May temperature of the year concurrent with ring formation (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Temp.May
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Furthermore, standardized residual BAI scores were negatively correlated with the numbers of freezing days occurring in October of the year preceding growth (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Freeze.Oct
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>−1)
 </sub>) and in June of the year of ring formation (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Freeze.Jun
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>a). In addition, the effect of heat stress on BAI was revealed by the negative correlations between standardized residual BAI scores and July temperature of the current growth year (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Temp.Jul
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Negative correlations with July and August DCs (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Drought.Jul
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub> and CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>‐Drought.Aug
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub>) were also observed, highlighting the influence of summer drought stress on BAI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). In parallel, standardized residual BAI scores were positively correlated with current‐year July precipitation (CS
 <sub class="sub">BAI</sub>–Prec.Jul
 <sub class="sub">(
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>)
 </sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>a). Individual‐tree level CS traits were consistent with the CS traits computed at the population level (visual inspection, Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S8</xref>). As for ring density, a negative effect of summer drought during the year preceding growth was detected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S9</xref>). Tree‐ring density was positively influenced by high temperatures during the growing season (May, June and July; Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S10</xref>).
