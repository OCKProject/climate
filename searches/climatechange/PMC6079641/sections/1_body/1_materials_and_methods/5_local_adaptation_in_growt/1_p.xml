<p class="p">We screened tree‐ring traits (type A, B and C) exhibiting among‐population variation that could be correlated with the climate of the provenance, an indication of local adaptation in growth responses to climate (Sork 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We used MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> as an indicator because it was highly correlated with the number of growing degree‐days above 5°C (
 <italic class="italic">r </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.97), which was found to be the best predictor of genetic variation in growth potential among 
 <italic class="italic">P. strobus</italic> populations (Joyce &amp; Rehfeldt, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> is correlated with MAP
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> in our study system (Spearman 
 <italic class="italic">r </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.42, with 
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.030 and df = 24, taking into account spatial autocorrelation; Dutilleul, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), and hence it also partially reflects a moisture availability gradient. First, Mantel tests were conducted to determine if similarities between population‐averaged time‐series of standardized residual BAI scores, as measured using pairwise correlations between time‐series, and geophysical characteristics of the provenances, were related (‘mantel.rtest’ function in the 
 <sc class="sc">ade</sc>4 R package; Dray &amp; Dufour, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Next, for type A and B traits, the relationship with provenance MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> was tested using both linear and second‐degree polynomial regressions. We tested for the effect of block sample size by including a covariate in these models, which was defined as the sample size ratio of block 1 vs block 2; the effect of the covariate was not significant. Model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The null hypothesis (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) was ‘no relationship with MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>’. Regarding the effect of MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> on CS traits (type C), a linear regression model provided the best fit. To reduce the risk of generating spurious results, we only tested the CS traits for which growth–climate correlations were significant in at least five populations. This threshold was arbitrarily set to allow sufficient interpopulation variance in the CS traits for the detection of genetic associations.
