<p class="p">Traits were classified according to the following nomenclature (A, B and C; see description in Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c): (A) mean xylem BAI (meanBAI
 <sub class="sub">1993–2014</sub>) and average density (avDens
 <sub class="sub">1993–2014</sub>) over the 1993–2014 period, corresponding to classic measures used in forestry; (B) growth variation for a specific year following an extreme climatic event; and (C) climatic sensitivity (CS) traits. Type A traits are long‐term averages that probably result from many climatic events or constraints on growth throughout a tree's lifespan, whereas type B and type C traits reflect growth responses to climate on a year‐to‐year basis. To illustrate type B traits, we analyzed the standardized residual BAI scores for the year 2003 (BAI
 <sub class="sub">2003</sub>) because we observed large among‐population variation during that year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), which could be related to lower temperatures observed in autumn 2002 and spring 2003 (Figs 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The standardized residual BAI
 <sub class="sub">2003</sub> scores indicate the relative growth variation of a population in comparison to its average growth level. Therein, a value of BAI
 <sub class="sub">2003</sub> &lt; 1 indicates a lower growth in 2003 as compared with the population's average growth level for the 1993–2014 period or, conversely, a BAI
 <sub class="sub">2003</sub> &gt; 1 indicates a higher growth than average.
