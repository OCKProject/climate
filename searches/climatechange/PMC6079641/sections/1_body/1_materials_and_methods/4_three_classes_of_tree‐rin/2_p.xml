<p class="p">CS (type C) traits were determined as follows. For each population, correlation analyses were computed between the annual standardized residual BAI scores, averaged at the population level, and the matrix of monthly climatic data (from 1993 to 2014) interpolated at the location of the common garden (Biondi &amp; Waikul, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Long‐term trends in climatic series were linearly detrended to obtain unbiased data of interannual climatic variations. Correlation analyses were performed for the period spanning from June of the year preceding ring formation to September of the year concurrent with ring formation to account for lagged effects from year to year (e.g. previous autumn freezing injury). The coefficients of correlation between growth metrics and climatic variables hereafter constitute the CS traits. Significance in correlation analyses was assessed using bootstrapped randomization (

CS traits were also calculated at the individual‐tree level to be used as phenotypes in GPAs (see below). As is routinely done in dendroecology, a response function analysis was also used as a complement to quantify the influence of climate on tree growth (Cook &amp; Kairiūkštis, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). This analysis is a multiple regression technique that uses the principal components of monthly climatic data to estimate growth–climate associations. This complementary analysis, made in support of the correlation analysis, controls for collinearity of monthly climate predictors; results are presented in the

 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). CS traits of the average density metric were also determined by repeating all of the above analyses on the annual standardized residual density scores, averaged at the population level.
