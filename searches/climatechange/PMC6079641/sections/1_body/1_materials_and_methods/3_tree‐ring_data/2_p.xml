<p class="p">Two BAI metrics were used in downstream analyses: the raw – absolute BAI and standardized residual BAI scores. Eliminating the intrinsic age‐ and size‐related growth trends in BAI makes it possible to address annual growth variability independently of biological age or tree size. Here, raw BAI chronologies, which were not normally distributed, were transformed using a logarithmic scaling and detrended using modified generalized exponential functions (‘Hugershoff’ type; Warren,

Additionally, an autoregressive model was applied to remove temporal autocorrelation in the time‐series, and residuals were extracted. Annual averages of these standardized residual BAI scores were computed for each population using a robust bi‐weight mean, which removes outliers attributable to disturbance or endogenous site factors (R library ‘
