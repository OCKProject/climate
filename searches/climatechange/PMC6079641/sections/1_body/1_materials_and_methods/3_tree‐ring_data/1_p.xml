<p class="p">At the end of October 2014, a 5‐mm‐diameter core was taken (from bark to pith) from each tree at 1.3 m above ground using a Pressler increment borer. Cores were kept frozen until being air‐dried, with no risk of developing mold. They were later sawn to a 1.7‐mm thickness longitudinally using a twin blade sleeve to obtain a smooth, thin surface. The same sample was used for dendrochronological and densitometric analyses. Annual rings of each core were visually cross‐dated with skeleton‐plots and pointer‐year identification under 4.5× magnification. Samples were then conditioned at a temperature of 20°C and relative humidity of 40% to maintain an equilibrium moisture content of 8%. For dendrochronological analyses, ring‐widths were measured from high‐resolution scanned images of the cores using the software Coo‐Recorder (Cybis, Saltsjöbaden, Sweden) at a precision of 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> mm. Cross‐dating was validated using the software CD
 <sc class="sc">endro</sc> (Cybis) and 
 <sc class="sc">cofecha</sc> (Holmes, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). The ring‐width measurement series were converted into basal area increment (BAI) chronologies using the R library ‘
 <sc class="sc">dpl</sc>R’ 1.6.3 (Bunn, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Average annual BAI for the 1993–2014 period was calculated for each population from the raw data to obtain absolute levels of growth.
