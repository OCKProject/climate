<p class="p">The density of each thin core slice was measured using a Quintek X‐ray measuring system at Université Laval (Quebec, Canada). Cores were scanned in 0.04‐mm steps, producing high‐resolution density profiles. Average annual density was determined for each tree ring and the correct identification of annual ring borders was verified using the previously cross‐dated ring‐width measurements. Mean ring density was calculated for each population by averaging the annual ring density of all trees in a population for the 1993–2014 period. Then, for each core, average ring‐density time‐series were detrended using modified generalized exponential functions and temporal autocorrelation was removed as described above. Finally, annual averages of these standardized residual density scores were computed for each population as described above.</p>
