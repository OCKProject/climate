<p class="p">Monthly means of daily temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>), mean monthly precipitation (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>) and monthly means of daily drought code (DC) time‐series at the Valcartier experimental site were obtained for the 1993–2014 period using the B
 <sc class="sc">io</sc>SIM v.10 software (Régnière &amp; Bolstad, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Daily temperature and precipitation data were interpolated from the eight closest weather stations, adjusted for elevation and location differentials with regional gradients, and averaged using inverse distance weighting (1/
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, where 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> is distance). Monthly values were computed from the average of the daily quantities. DC is an index for the amount of moisture stored in deep organic layers and soils and takes into account snow arrival in autumn and thawing in spring based on modeled snow accumulation (Terrier 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The drought season is defined as the snow‐free period, which ranges from 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. May to October. DC is unitless and ranges from 0 to 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 800, with low values indicating low drought risk and high values indicating high drought risk. Collinearity amongst these different monthly climate variables (temperature, precipitation and drought) is generally low according to pairwise Spearman rank correlation analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Mean annual temperature and precipitation of each provenance (MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> and MAP
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>, respectively) were also computed and averaged over the 1961–1990 period (i.e. the period corresponding to seed collection) using B
 <sc class="sc">io</sc>SIM v.10.
