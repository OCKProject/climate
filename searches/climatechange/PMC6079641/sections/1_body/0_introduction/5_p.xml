<p class="p">Here, we develop a new class of phenotypes that reflect responses to interannual climatic variability across trees’ lifespan. We then combine these new climate‐related phenotypes with association genetics to establish a link between the genotypes, phenotypes and climatic constraints affecting trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The present study demonstrates how tree‐ring traits derived from dendroecology can be used to identify and quantify climatic constraints influencing tree growth; study local adaptation in growth responses to such constraints; and identify and validate the genes putatively involved in such adaptation processes. We illustrate our approach using a 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus strobus</italic> (eastern white pine, hereafter 
 <italic class="italic">P. strobus</italic>) common garden experiment located in Quebec that includes provenances from a wide range of environments across the species’ distribution area in eastern North America. This species is representative of many temperate and boreal tree species for which the magnitude and speed of climate change are expected to induce widespread range shifts by 2060 (Joyce &amp; Rehfeldt,
