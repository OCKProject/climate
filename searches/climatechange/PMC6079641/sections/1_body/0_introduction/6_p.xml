<p class="p">As a first step, a tree‐ring analysis was conducted to provide three different classes of phenotypic traits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Traits included average annual ring width and density (hereafter type A traits), relative growth variation for a given year following an extreme climatic event (type B traits) and climatic sensitivity (CS) traits, that is, the strength of relationships between annual growth and climatic variation such as temperature and drought (type C traits). In a second step, those traits were correlated with mean annual temperature of the provenance (MAT
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) to search for local adaptation in growth responses to climate (e.g. genetic–environment clines). Third, GPA analyses were performed on those tree‐ring traits to identify putative loci involved in growth responses to climatic constraints and to further cross‐validate candidate genes that had been identified in a previous GEA study (Nadeau
