<p class="p">Local adaptation in tree species has been documented through a long history of common garden experiments composed of georeferenced genetic material (provenances), where dendrometric traits such as diameter or height growth were used as proxies for fitness (Langlet,

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The rapidity of climate change advocates the use of those existing common garden experiments (which have already been exposed to warming during the last few decades) to investigate responses to climate change (e.g. Rehfeldt

In combination with genomic approaches, common gardens represent a unique opportunity to decipher the genomic architecture of local adaptation, and to identify putative genes or genomic regions involved in tree species’ responses to climate (Lepais &amp; Bacles,
