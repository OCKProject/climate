<p class="p">Two genomic strategies are commonly used to search for genes involved in local adaptation to climate (Sork

 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The first is the genotype–environment association (GEA) method that looks for correlations between genetic markers and environmental variables from where populations/individuals originate (Joost 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Coop 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, GEA does not provide information about the phenotypic traits controlled by the candidate genes. Another strategy is to test for associations between genotypes growing in a common environment and traits of interest (genotype–phenotype association; GPA). GPA has the advantage of establishing more direct links between genes and traits potentially under selection (e.g. Eckert 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, in tree species, the list of functional traits that closely reflect adaptation to climate is still rather limited and labor‐intensive to evaluate (for a review, see Aitken &amp; Bemmels, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In particular, assessment of dendrometric traits usually consists of punctual measurements (e.g. height or diameter at a certain age) that are probably the cumulative result of many different climatic events and constraints that occurred throughout the tree's lifespan. The use of innovative tools and methods to measure traits that reflect how and when climate exerts selective constraints (Rahaman 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Urban 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) is thus needed to improve our understanding of species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate.
