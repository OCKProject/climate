<p class="p">GPA analysis conducted on a combination of dendrometric and tree‐ring traits allowed the detection of significant associations for both candidate and noncandidate SNPs from Nadeau

While the noncandidate SNPs may also contain relevant genes for responses to climate, our main goal was to see whether we could confirm those candidate SNPs that had previously been detected in genetic–environment associations (Nadeau 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and gain further insights about their putative roles in adaptation to climate. For climate‐related traits (types B and C), we found a greater proportion of significant SNPs in candidate than in noncandidate SNPs. In addition, the independent validation of candidate SNPs from a previous study using different samples and different methods should reduce false positives and so we further discuss the candidate genes here. GPA analyses confirmed 12 of the 21 candidate SNPs (six very likely, two likely, four uncertain), and 10 of them (eight genes) were associated with climate‐related traits (types B and C). The five strongest candidate SNPs in Nadeau

Although false positives are possible, many loci were associated with several traits and with different levels of correction for population structure and kinship, thus increasing our confidence in the results.
