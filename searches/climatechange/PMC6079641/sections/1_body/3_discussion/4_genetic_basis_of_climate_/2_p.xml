<p class="p">The associations between candidate SNPs and type B and C tree‐ring traits provided information about the climatic constraints affecting 
 <italic class="italic">P. strobus</italic> growth, and thus helped bridge the gap between the genotypes, the phenotypes and the environmental selection pressures. Taken together, our results suggest that the putative functions obtained for the genes detected in GPA associations were plausible, because information found in the literature supports the established associations between the candidate SNPs and the measured traits reflecting either drought tolerance, freeze tolerance or both. Several SNPs were associated with both freeze and drought tolerance traits (three very likely and one likely; Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Among those, SNP N‐029 was located within a bHlH (basic helix–loop–helix) transcription factor, which is known to confer tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in higher plants (Table 
 <xref rid="nph14968-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Similarly, the gene containing SNP N‐040 codes for a thylakoid luminal protein involved in photosystem II, one of the most susceptible components of the photosynthetic machinery that bears the brunt of abiotic stresses. Other SNPs were specifically associated with either freeze or drought tolerance traits. Interestingly, the GAUT (SNPs M‐017, very likely; O‐002, uncertain) and the endoglucanase genes (SNP G‐004, uncertain), which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, were specifically associated with growth responses to freezing events (Table 
 <xref rid="nph14968-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). By preserving and stabilizing cell structures, carbohydrates associated with the cell wall can enhance freezing tolerance by controlling water movement and ice formation under cold conditions (Tenhaken, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In addition, one SNP (G‐014; uncertain), exclusively associated with drought tolerance traits (Table 
 <xref rid="nph14968-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), encoded a PLASTID MOVEMENT IMPAIRED1 (PMI1), a protein that mediates the abscisic acid (ABA)‐dependent pathway under drought conditions in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Rojas‐Pierce 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Contrary to cold‐responsive genes, many water‐stress‐inducible genes are upregulated by ABA under drought conditions (Yamaguchi‐Shinozaki &amp; Shinozaki, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Further gene expression and functional studies aimed at identifying coexpressed gene networks involved in specific biological processes, such as freeze tolerance, would be needed to determine the exact role of those genes in 
 <italic class="italic">P. strobus</italic> and in other conifers (for a review, see Serin 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Multi‐SNP GPA models (e.g. Segura 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) should also be tested given that highly metric traits such as growth are probably controlled by a large number of interacting genes, which was beyond the scope of this study given the small number of SNPs tested.
