<p class="p">The positive influence of a longer growing season on growth is shown by the positive effect of previous October and current May temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), as well as the negative effect of previous October and current June number of days below 0°C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>). Warm spring conditions result in an earlier cessation of dormancy and earlier cambium reactivation, which leads to a longer growth period (Begum 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Similarly, a warm autumn during the year before ring formation translates into more time available for accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves (Hartmann &amp; Trumbore, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and for the division of leaf primordia meristematic cells in buds (Fritts, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1976</xref>; Macey &amp; Arnott, 
 <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). This influence of temperature in combination with photoperiod on the growth of the tree populations under study could be confirmed by studying bud and cambium phenology (e.g. Perrin
