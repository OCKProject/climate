<p class="p">Growth was limited by summer heat or drought, with a negative correlation with July temperature (Fig.

 <xref rid="nph14968-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>). Warm summers can have a direct negative effect on growth by increasing the ratio of carbohydrates allocated to maintenance respiration, while hydric stress reduces both water intake and photosynthesis through stomata closure (Hartmann &amp; Trumbore,
