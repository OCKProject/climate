<p class="p">The study of tree rings makes it possible to precisely determine the influence of yearly climatic anomalies on growth during a tree's life cycle; this information cannot be obtained from conventional approaches used in tree genetics, such as the study of tree height or diameter at a given age. It also has the advantage of accounting for time‚Äêlagged effects of climate, which is particularly relevant for conifer species showing a determined growth pattern. For instance, autumn temperatures may influence the timing of budburst of the subsequent year, which in turn can impact tree fitness (Heide,
