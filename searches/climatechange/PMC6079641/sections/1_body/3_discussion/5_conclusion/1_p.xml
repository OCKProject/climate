<p class="p">Accurately determining the periods of the year when trees are most vulnerable to abiotic and biotic factors is crucial to understanding the genetic architecture of local adaption. In this paper, we showed that tree‐ring traits measured in common garden experiments offer great potential to unravel local adaptation in forest trees through a fine‐scale, retrospective and dynamic view of tree responses to past environmental variations. For the first time, we proposed using a metric (i.e. climate sensitivity traits; CS) that incorporates both the phenotypic trait under study (i.e. growth or wood density) and the response to climate in association genetic studies. We identified important climatic constraints and the critical times of the year when those constraints affect growth, information that cannot be derived from classic measurements such as height and DBH. We believe that this novel approach will provide a valuable contribution to the study of differences in climate sensitivity between provenances in common garden experiments, and more generally to examine forest adaptation to environmental changes.</p>
