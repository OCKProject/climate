<p class="p">This study illustrates how the combined analysis of tree‐ring traits derived from dendroecology and genotypes from a common garden experiment can contribute to understanding the complex relationship between genotypes, phenotypes (growth responses embedded in the annual rings) and interannual climatic fluctuations. Indeed, the new class of phenotypes obtained provided useful information to identify climatic constraints for a given tree species. We illustrated this approach by an examination of the CS traits shaping the growth of an important conifer in eastern North America's temperate forests. We quantified the sensitivity of populations to climatic‐related constraints across their lifespan and identified the critical times of the year (or previous year) when those constraints affected growth. We then highlighted the clinal variation along MAT
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> for those traits. This approach made it possible to identify candidate genes for local adaptation in growth responses to climatic variability, and to cross‐validate candidate loci obtained from an independent GEA study.
