   <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
   <xref rid="nph14968-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) are represented by gray (northern group) and black (southern group) points. Significant relationships among all provenances suggesting local adaptation are represented by black lines. Significant relationships for the subset of provenances from the northern genetic structure group are represented by a blue line. The relationships were chosen according to a model selection procedure (Akaike information criterion, see the 
   <xref rid="nph14968-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Materials and Methods</xref> section) between a linear model and a second‐order polynomial regression model. Only significant models are shown.
