<p class="p">In order to obtain large enough samples for milling and nutritional quality analyses, rice grains from each of the cultivar × drought × temperature treatment were pooled, and each of these samples was thereafter stored individually at −20 °C. A working sample was thereafter collected from each of these stored samples for freeze-drying in 48 h. The freeze-dried whole grains were thereafter grinded using an IKA-WERKE grinder type A10, (SKAFTE medlab, Mindelheim, Germany). The flour was stored at −20 °C until further analyses. All analyses of nutritional quality were then made in triplicate from the flour.</p>
