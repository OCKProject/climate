<p class="p">The gel consistency (GC) of each sample was measured following the gel consistency test for eating quality of rice developed by Cagampang et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Briefly, 0.2 mL of 95% ethanol containing 0.025% thymol blue was added to 100 ± 0.5 mg of rice flour in a culture tube. After vortexing, 2 mL of 0.2N KOH were added, and the mixture was vortexed again. The tubes were covered by concave marble glass and directly put in a boiling water bath (95 °C) for 8 min. The tubes were then cooled at room temperature for 5 min and placed on ice water for 15 min. After cooling, the tubes were horizontally placed on a millimetric paper, and the length of the gel was measured from the bottom of the tube to the top of the gel run.
