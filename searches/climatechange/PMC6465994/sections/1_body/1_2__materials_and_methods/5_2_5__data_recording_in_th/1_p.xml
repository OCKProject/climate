<p class="p">After each drought treatment, the number of tillers plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was counted. Drought sensitivity was evaluated applying the 0–9 scoring scale for leaf rolling and drying, as proposed by the IRRI [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], although scoring was carried out separately at the seedling and tillering stages. The recovery rate was calculated 10 days after resuming watering, as the percentage of recovered plants over the total number of plants that were present before the drought treatment. Days to flowering were counted as days after sowing to 50% of plants flowering. Number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, panicle length, number of spikelets panicle
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and spikelet sterility rate (percentage of sterile grains over total number of grains panicle
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were counted at harvesting time. Each mature plant was harvested individually. The panicles were manually threshed, and the grain yield plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was measured using a precision balance.
