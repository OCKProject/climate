<p class="p">For the present experiment, five replications of a total of seven cultivars were grown using seven different drought treatments and two different temperature treatments. To control the effect of environmental factors, except the selected drought and temperature treatments, the rice cultivars were grown in growth chambers in the biotron of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) at Alnarp. SLU biotron chambers are known for their high accuracy and low level of between-chamber effects [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], all plants in the experiment were sown at the same time. Thus, two growth chambers were used in this experiment: The first chamber was set at a day and night temperature of 26/23 °C (low temperature, T1), whereas the second was set at 30/27 °C (high temperature, T2) for the whole growing period. The selection of temperatures for the experiment were based on Kohl [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Thus, we used the low optimum temperature of 25 °C as a starting point for the calculation of night temperatures. By decreasing and increasing this optimum temperature by 2 °C, we set the night temperatures to 23 °C and 27 °C, respectively. Thereby, the selected night temperatures can be seen as representatives of an increase in night temperature from climate change in highland and lowland conditions of Rwanda, respectively. Day temperatures were set to 3 °C higher than night temperatures following the procedure by Harrington [

Thereby, we ended up with day and night temperatures of 26/23 °C (low temperature, T1) and 30/27 °C (high temperature, T2), representing climate predicted climate changes in the lowland and highland of Rwanda, respectively.
