 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Drought treatments and cultivars were analyzed according to the mean values for each character evaluated by the regression analyses. An analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by calculations of means separated with Tukey’s test (
