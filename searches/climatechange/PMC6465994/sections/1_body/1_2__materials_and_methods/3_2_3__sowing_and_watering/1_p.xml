<p class="p">Pots with the size 6 × 10 × 12 cm were filled with soil and placed in big plastic trays. Two seeds per pot were sown, and, after emergence, the most vigorous seedling in each pot was left to grow. A total of 35 plants (five plants per cultivar) were grown in each tray and seven trays, i.e., a total of 245 plants, were kept in each growth chamber. The soil was kept wet by regular watering from soil surface up to three weeks after sowing. Thereafter, water was added to the plastic trays, and plants got access to the water through holes in the bottom of the pots. Water depth was maintained at 5 cm in the tray by regularly adding water to it. </p>
