In this study, the aim was to evaluate the effects of drought at different growth stages, and, therefore, a number of different drought treatments were applied, i.e., well-watered throughout the growth cycle (D0), drought during the seedling stage only (DS), drought during the seedling and active tillering stages (DST), drought at the active tillering stage only (DT), drought at the active tillering and reproductive stages (DTR), drought at reproductive stage only (DR), and drought at every stage, i.e., the seedling, active tillering, and reproductive stages (DSTR). To initiate drought stress, the trays were drained from water using a tiny tube, and water was not added to the trays again until the drought treatment was finalized. For drought during the seedling stage (DS), the plants were drought treated for two weeks. For drought during the active tillering stage (DT), water was withheld for two weeks; plants were then watered from the soil surface for one day and drought stressed again for another two weeks. For drought at the reproductive stage (DR), the drought stress cycle was one week of drought, one day of watering, and one week of drought. The combined drought treatments (DST, DTR, and DSTR) used the same treatments as for the separate treatments but in combined doses. Soil water content was measured in the pots at the end of each drought treatment period using an AT Delta—T device (Theta probe type HH1). The probe readings were between 36 and 87 in drought stressed pots, depending on drought treatment and cultivar; in non-stressed pots, it was 513, i.e., a soil moisture content of 7–17% in drought treated pots. After each drought treatment described above, watering was resumed by adding water to the tray.
