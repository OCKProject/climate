<p class="p">The present study showed the limited influence of drought treatment on quality characteristics of rice, where only GT was clearly affected by and positively correlated with temperature. Previous studies have shown that an increased temperature reduces the grain starch and amylose content and also decreases the activity of granule-bound starch synthase [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], which might affect the GT. Independent of drought treatment, the cultivars ‘Mpembuke’ and ‘Ndamirabahinzi’ showed (together with ‘Nemeyubutaka’), high grain content of TAC and TPC, corresponding to previous results on these cultivars [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The results suggest that the content of phytochemicals/bioactive compounds might be under strong genetic control which means that it would be possible to breed for rice high in human health related compounds. High genetic diversity in bioactive compounds has been consistently found in rice cultivars [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Furthermore, QTLs with significant additive effects have been identified for some bioactive compounds in rice [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], which implies options to use marker assisted selection. In addition, AmC, GC, and protein content were found more related to cultivar than to treatment in the present study. Significant differences between genotypes for AmC and protein content have been observed in rice, whereas differences between drought and irrigation treatments [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and between temperatures [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] have been negligible. The inheritance of AmC and GC in rice has been revealed to be predominantly governed by additive gene action [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Therefore, the genetic diversity present in the Rwandan rice cultivars offers opportunities to improve quality characteristics within the material.
