<p class="p">The present study was carried out in climate chambers in the biotron at SLU, Alnarp. Despite the fact that climate chamber cultivations are not totally comparable with field cultivations, climate chamber experiments have the advantage of opportunities to control environmental effects on the cultivation. Plants grown in the same chamber have got exactly the same environmental conditions with the exception of treatments given to the plants (e.g., drought treatments in our case). The repeatability of experiments is also increasing with the use of climate chambers, as between-chamber effects are normally low, and, if they exist, they are mostly due to resolvable effects, i.e., the need for the reparation of malfunctioning components [

However, a minor risk in our study is that the differences between temperature treatments we see might also partly be a result of between-chamber effects as used temperature treatments were divided in between chambers. Due to the high and well-known accuracy between the biotron chambers with a low level of between-chambers resolvable effects, we see this risk as low. In addition, the temperature results in this study correspond with results from field trials on drought stress for the same cultivars (unpublished results). In the present study, we also wanted to avoid experimental cultivation of the rice plants in various periods over the year; instead, we focused on at the same time planting to secure avoidance of effects of endogenous rhythms in plants [
