<p class="p">Though the temperature sets were within the limits for rice development and productivity, this study showed that even small differences in temperature during rice growth may result in severe yield losses under recurrent drought. A small increase in temperature, which might come due to the predicted climate change, might be beneficial for rice production in highland areas of Rwanda, where the temperature currently is at the lower limit for rice production. However, this study shows that the positive effects of a small increase in temperature does not persist at recurrent drought conditions. Therefore, changes in temperatures prevailing in a specific environment should not be left behind when planning for improvement of rice for drought tolerance. There were large differences in panicle development between cultivars and between drought Ã— temperature treatments. Hence, this trait may serve as selection criteria for rice tolerance to concurrent abiotic stresses.</p>
