<p class="p">Early plant development was affected more by the drought treatments than by differences in temperature. The different drought treatments in the present study resulted in various effects on plant development. Thus, drought at the seedling and tillering stages resulted in leaf rolling and drying at these stages, and repeated drought treatments delayed the flowering—as did the low temperature treatment. A delayed flowering might be associated with reduced early growth. Previous studies have reported a reduction of relative water content from exposure to a low temperature [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]; both circumstances resulted in a delayed plant development. Early growth rate, leaf emergence, and tillering capacity was found to increase with rising temperatures, from 25 to 31 °C, as a result of increasing photosynthesis [

Thus, in our study, the shorter time to flowering in plants grown at a high temperature might be associated with high early growth rate. Drought at the seedling stage significantly reduced the recovery rate of the plants at both the seedling and tillering stages. Thus, this study showed the rice plants to be most sensitive to drought at the seedling stage, especially if followed with drought at the tillering stage and even more so at high temperatures.
