<p class="p">The cultivars included in this study reacted differently to the temperature and drought treatments. Effects of drought treatments on different genotypes is known to be the result of a range of various characters in the plant, including both root and leaf characters [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, the only persistent difference recorded was that ‘Zong geng’ showed significantly higher drought sensitivity as compared to the other cultivars as it showed a higher leaf rolling and drying at both the seedling and tillering stages and the significantly largest decrease in number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Grown at a high temperature, ‘Zong geng’ produced spikelets only while not drought treated; grown at a low temperature, this cultivar produced spikelets only when well-watered and when treated with drought at the seedling stage (also combined with drought at the tillering stage). ‘Jyambere’, a cultivar reported in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] as high yielding, did not show higher performance while drought treated than the other cultivars. Similarly to the present study, leaf rolling and drying were found to increase, while the tillering rate and number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> decreased, with drought stress, although at significantly different extents in different cultivars [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>].
