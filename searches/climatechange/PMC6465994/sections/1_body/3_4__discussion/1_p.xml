<p class="p">Our results clearly showed a negative concurrent effect of the temperature and single/repeated drought treatments at various growth stages on rice production and yield. Drought impacted to the highest extent the early plant development, while the genetic component—i.e., different cultivars— determined the quality of rice to the largest extent. Thus, our results clearly showed that the predicted increase in temperature and drought due to climate change will impact rice production, which, in turn, might influence food security in vulnerable highly populated areas around the equator.</p>
