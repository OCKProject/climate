<p class="p">Previous results have shown that exposure to stress at an early developmental stage can affect the tolerance and survival of plants when stressed again at a later stage [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In the present study, the cultivars seemed to have a beneficial stress memory regarding drought stress to different degrees, and the presence of such a memory seemed to be influenced by the temperature treatment. The cultivars ‘Mpembuke’ and ‘Ndamirabahinzi’ seemed to have quite a beneficial strong stress memory, especially when grown at a low temperature, since they were not able to produce panicles and yield when drought stressed at the seedling stage but were able to produce panicles and yield after recurrent drought stresses. In addition, ‘Ndamirabahinzi’ seemed to have a stress memory if subjected to stress at a somewhat later stage, as a similar behavior was recorded for plants stressed at the tillering stage at first and then subjected to recurrent stresses. The sustained accumulation of stress signaling proteins or transcription factors at different levels from the initial state after stress alleviation was proposed as possible mechanism of plant memory [

 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] and may confer longer lasting effects than the metabolite accumulation. Further research may be able to elucidate the stress memory mechanisms under combined heat and drought.
