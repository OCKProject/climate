<p class="p">High temperature stress (above the optimum of 25–30 °C [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]) or drought conditions have negative effects on plant development, including irreversible injury to growth and development of the plant, reduction of photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], reduction in number of panicles per plant and peduncle elongation, limitations of pollen production [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], no swelling of pollen grains, and increased spikelet sterility [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Low temperatures (below the optimum of 25–30 °C [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]) lead to inhibited seedling growth, reduced panicle development, delayed heading, poor panicle exertion, low spikelet fertility, and poor grain quality [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Besides affecting growth and grain yield, water and temperature stresses change the quality and chemical composition of rice. Levels of starch, phenols, flavonoids, and phytic acid were shown to decrease, whereas antioxidant capacity, content of amylose, oxalic acid, calcium, and iron seemed to increase in drought-stressed grains [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In another study, gelatinization temperature decreased in drought stressed rice grains, whereas it increased under heat stress [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Therefore, the predicted increase in drought and heat stresses constitute a great threat to rice productivity and quality characteristics, and it may affect lives of millions of the world’s population, especially in poor areas of the tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], where rice constitute a staple food. Consequent to reduction in grain yield, food insecurity, malnutrition, extreme poverty, and other health and social problems will increase if no appropriate measures are taken to mitigate the effects of climate change on food production.
