 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], and breeding for drought or heat/cold stress are different solutions that have been adopted to mitigate rice productivity at climate change. For example, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed drought tolerant cultivars such as ‘Sahbhagi Dhan,’ ‘Sahod Ulan,’ and ‘Sookha Dhan’ grown today in India, the Philippines, and Nepal, respectively [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Treatment strategies need to be, therefore, carefully adopted to fit the circumstances. The co-occurrence of drought and heat stress extremes is likely to increase—both in intensity and frequency—with the actual global warming. Simultaneously, cold nights can still be an issue in rice growing highland valleys of, for instance, Rwanda. Gaps still exist in the knowledge of concomitant environmental effects on rice growth, productivity, and the quality of harvested grains. Hence, understanding rice responses to a combination of temperature and drought stress, as well as their recurrence across plant developmental stages, is needed.
