<p class="p">The aim of this study was to investigate how drought and temperature stress combinations during different growth stages affect rice growth, grain yield, eating quality, and health promoting compounds. The acquired knowledge will form the basis for the successful cultivation and breeding of novel rice cultivars that will sustain rice production and nutritional quality within a changing climate, thereby contributing towards human health by reducing poverty in densely populated rice growing areas. </p>
