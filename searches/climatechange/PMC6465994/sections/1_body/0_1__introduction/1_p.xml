<p class="p">Rice (
 <italic class="italic">Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is a major staple food crop in the world which contributes to both food security and income generation, particularly within developing countries [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Rice has a semi-aquatic phylogenetic origin and thrives in diverse environments if provided with sufficient water [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and temperatures ranging from 20 to 35 °C. Around 50% of the rice cultivated area is irrigated, whereas rainfed cultivation covers 43% and submerged cultivation covers 7% [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In Rwanda, rice growing areas include lowland valleys at around 900 m above sea level with temperature over the growing season ranging from 17 to 33 °C and highland valleys at around 1700 m above sea level with temperatures from 15 to 27 °C [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. According to Meteo Rwanda measurements, humidity is normally relatively low in Rwanda rice cultivation areas (50–75%). The predicted global warming constitutes a serious threat to rice production as well as to the quality of the produced rice. Temperature stress and drought are predicted to increase to a higher extent in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], which are the main rice producing areas. The predicted temperature increase for Rwanda is 0.9–2.2 °C until the mid-21st century, with increasing number of extreme weather events [
