<p class="p">The means of grain yield and yield components for all cultivars and treatments of this study are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01043" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. Generally, the applied drought treatments heavily affected the presence and number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and, thereby, grain yield (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01043-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The D0 treatment (no drought) at a high temperature resulted in the significantly highest number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Combined drought treatment at the seedling and tillering stages (DST, DSTR) at a high temperature had a detrimental effect on the presence of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and, thereby, yield, resulting in zero panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for all evaluated cultivars (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01043-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The cultivar ‘Intsindagirabigega’ showed a high number of plants with panicles, being able to better withstand all the evaluated drought treatments except the combined seedling and tillering treatments (DST and DSTR) at a high temperature (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01043-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The cultivar ‘Zong geng’ clearly showed the significantly lowest number of panicles plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, with a decrease at all drought treatments at a high temperature and at all drought treatments except DS and DST at the lower temperature (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01043-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The cultivars ‘Mpembuke’ and ‘Ndamirabahinzi’ both showed sensitivity to drought stress at the seedling stage (DS) at a low temperature, although being able to produce panicles at combined drought stresses at the seedling stage and at later stages (DST, DSTR). The numbers of spikelets panicle−
 <sup class="sup">1</sup> and spikelets sterility were generally higher at a low temperature than at a high temperature (data not shown). Furthermore, all drought treatments resulted in severe decreases in yield as compared to when the plants were subjected to no drought (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.025) was found between soil and water content at the end of the experiment and grain yield.
