<p class="p">The means of grain AmC, GC, GT, total protein content, TPC, and TAC for all cultivars and treatments are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01043" class="xref">Table S2</xref>. In general, variation in the evaluated quality characteristics seemed to be more dependent on cultivar than on temperature or drought treatment. In a principal component analysis, the cultivars were shown to cluster into three groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b) corresponding to evaluated quality characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). The first and second principal components explained 32% and 24% of the variation, respectively. The cultivars ‘Mpembuke’ (C4), ‘Ndamirabahinzi’ (C5), and ‘Nemeyubutaka’ (C6) showed positive values on the first principal component (encircled by a full line) independent of temperature and drought treatment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a) in these cultivars. Regression analyses also showed a high degree of cultivar determination for TAC (33.7%) and TPC (16.5%) content, and analysis of variance followed by mean comparisons confirmed that these cultivars have high TAC and TPC contents (results not shown). Furthermore, the cultivars ‘Ingwizabukungu’ (C1), ‘Intsindagirabigega’ (C2), and ‘Zong geng’ (C7) were clustered with negative principal component analyses values (encircled by a dashed line; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b) independent of temperature and drought treatment, indicating high AmC and GC content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a), which was also verified by analyses of variance followed by mean comparisons (results not shown). The cultivar ‘Jyambere’ (C3), independent of treatments, formed the third cluster (encircled by a dotted line) with negative values on the second principal component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b), indicating high protein and GT values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a), which was verified by analyses of variance followed by mean comparisons (not shown). The principal component analysis indicates a possible influence of the growing temperature on GT values, with significantly higher GT values at the high temperature treatment (verified by analyses of variance and mean comparisons). In addition, regression analyses showed 10.4% of the variation in GT to be explained by temperature, as compared to 0.1% being determined by cultivar (results not shown).
