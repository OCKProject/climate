<p class="p">A principal component analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) clearly showed the drought at the tillering stage as being the main component determining leaf rolling and drying at the tillering stage, i.e., DST, DT, DTR, and DSTR (encircled by a dotted line) are treatments that have positive values for the second principal component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b), as is shown also for leaf rolling and drying at the tillering stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a). Similarly, positive values of the first principal component were found both for samples with drought treatment at the seedling stage (DS, DST, and DSTR; encircled by a full line, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b), and for leaf rolling and drying at the seedling stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01043-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a). The first principal component explained 48% of the variation, while the second principal component explained 32% of the variation. Among the cultivars, ‘Zong geng’ (No 7) was found to be the most sensitive to drought stress, showing high values of the first principal component (high values of leaf rolling and drying at the seedling stage) during seedling drought and high values of the second principal component (high values of leaf rolling and drying at tillering) during drought at the tillering stage. The number of tillers plant
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> decreased, while leaf rolling and leaf drying increased after drought stress at the seedling and tillering stages (
