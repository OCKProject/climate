  <p class="p">Loading (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and score (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) plot from principal components analysis of amylose content (AmC), gel consistency (GC), gelatinisation temperature (GT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC), and total protein content (Prot) in grains of rice cultivars stressed with drought at different development stages. Treatments corresponding to high TAC, TPC, and protein content are encircled by a full line, whereas a dashed line encircles the treatments corresponding to high or low eating and cooking qualities (AmC, GC, and GT), and a dotted line encircles the treatment corresponding to low content of all analyzed nutritional quality traits. T1: 26/23 °C; T2: 30/27 °C; DS: Drought treatment at seedling stage; DST: Drought treatment at the seedling and tillering stage; DT: Drought treatment at the tillering stage; DTR: Drought treatment at the tillering and reproductive stages; DR: Drought treatment at reproductive stage; DSTR: Drought treatment at the seedling, tillering, and reproductive stages. Numbers refer to cultivars as follow; C1: ‘Ingwizabukungu’; C2: ‘Intsindagirabigega’; C3: ‘Jyambere’; C4: ‘Mpembuke’; C5: ‘Ndamirabahinzi’; C6: ‘Nemeyubutaka’; and C7: ‘Zong geng’.
