 </sup> Climate change has the potential to alter or extend the natural ranges of these organisms and make regions of our globe that were previously uninhabitable for parasites habitable.

 </sup> Increases in temperature affect the life cycles of parasites, which can directly affect how prevalent the organism is within the area, considering many parasitic organisms have a temperature-dependent developmental baseline, either within their host or in the environment.
