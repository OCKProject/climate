<p class="p">Parasites can be just as damaging to an economy in water as they are on land. Just this year,

 </sup> The possibility that climate change and corresponding ocean current events facilitated the parasite’s presence in the Alaskan region cannot be ruled out. This is concerning because it means both wild-caught and farm-raised salmon are at risk of contracting this parasite, which certainly has a negative impact on the species’ health but could have a negative impact on the salmon fishing industry as well. Parasitic diseases, vector-borne and helminthic alike, can seriously deteriorate livestock health and production and prove detrimental to local and global economies while also posing a significant threat to future food security.
