<p class="p">Tsetse fly ranges were also modeled under climate change scenarios, and although these ranges are not expected to expand excessively, they are expected to shift significantly, negatively affected by climate change.

 </sup> In Zimbabwe, for example, tsetse fly abundance is decreasing due to a combination of vector control and too high temperatures that might negatively affect their survival, however habitat fragmentation, although creating conditions leading to higher populations of older flies, still increases the rate of infection and risk of disease.
