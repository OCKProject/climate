 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> tick species are perhaps best recognized as transmitters of bacteria and viruses such as 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (Lyme disease) or 
 <italic class="italic">Flaviviridae</italic> (tick-borne encephalitis), but they are also vectors for the protozoa that cause babesiosis. Greater than average precipitation during late spring or early summer likely promotes tick activity and increases survival rates in the Northeastern United States.

 </sup> In Sweden, a northern shift and increase in the density of 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> tick populations in the 1990s was related to a changing climate, which consisted of milder winters and prolonged spring and autumn seasons compared with the 1980s.

 </sup> Similarly, Canada and parts of subarctic Russia have seen increases in tick populations and tick-transmitted diseases as temperatures have increased.

 </sup> Warmer climates have also been associated with better synchrony between larval and nymph stage ticks, and this allows faster disease transmission and more virulent strains of disease to persist in tick vectors.

 </sup> Canine babesiosis cases have occurred under certain local climate constraints, such as a necessary temperature increase to 12 C to initiate soil defrosting and termination with temperature drops, concurrent rainfall, or intense drought.

 </sup> Indirectly, weather conditions change people’s behavior and put them at greater exposure to ticks. For example, increased rainfall may aid mushroom growth in Poland, promoting mushroom harvests after rainy weeks when ticks are also more active, thus putting the harvesters at greater risk of being bitten.

 </sup> Combined with land use alterations, climate change is permitting ticks to increase their distribution farther North and pose a threat to new communities previously unexposed to diseases such as babesiosis.

 </sup> This has been demonstrated by a noticeable increase in babesiosis incidence in disparate parts of the world such as the United States,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="bibr72-1178633617732296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>
 </sup> Canada, and the United Kingdom,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="bibr74-1178633617732296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>
 </sup> as temperatures warmed. Unfortunately, this trend is set to continue as distribution models have predicted that tick populations will expand further north in upcoming decades due to direct climatic factors and changing movement/migration of wild host species such as birds, deer, and the white-footed mouse.
