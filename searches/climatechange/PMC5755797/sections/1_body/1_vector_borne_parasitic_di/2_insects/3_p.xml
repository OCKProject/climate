<p class="p">It is a known fact, based on written accounts of clinical symptoms and treatments used, that malaria was common in Europe prior to the 19th century.

 </sup> Both Chaucer and Shakespeare alluded to the disease in their works, and the high disease prevalence has now been attributed to the extensive marshlands in England which would have supported the 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.

 </sup> The most effective treatment for ague at that time was cinchona powder from the bark of cinchona trees, and this particular tree bark contained quinine,

 </sup> further revealing malaria as the disease being described. Risk modeling for the distribution of one particular 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquito, 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic>, has revealed that the climate of central Northwestern Europe is now warmer, wetter, and more favorable for the mosquitoes while areas with hotter, drier summers in Southern Europe may see a decline in mosquito populations in future.

 </sup> Other 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> species can be expected to follow similar patterns. In the future, however, it may be important to consider the possibility of mosquito species adapting to their changing environment, permitting them to remain in hot, southern regions.

 </sup> but poorer nations without the luxury of sound infrastructure bear a greater burden, and thus, the cycle of disease and poverty is likely to continue in these countries. Herein lies the significant conundrum of climate change and infectious diseases and its capacity to negatively affect public health.
