<p class="p">Other parasitic diseases with mosquito vectors are at a similar risk of spreading with a changing climate. The distribution of lymphatic filariasis can be determined by looking at soil and plant canopy moisture levels because these can indicate the presence of mosquito larvae breeding sites.

 </sup> As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so will soil moisture levels and the corresponding mosquito populations. An ecological niche model created to scout the potential distribution of lymphatic filariasis in Africa revealed that depending on the severity of future climate change, the number of people at risk of infection could increase from 543 to 804 million to an astounding 1.65 to 1.86 billion as soon as 2050.
