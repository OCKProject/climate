<p class="p">Echinococcosis is a disease caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Echinococcus granulosus</italic>, with a life cycle requiring no arthropod vectors. However, this parasite does not have a specific intermediate host, rather it uses a variety of organisms such as the fox, cat, and dog.

 </sup> Unfortunately, this parasite has been able to use the raccoon dog as a definitive host, allowing it to expand its geographical range, thus further expanding the range of 
 <italic class="italic">Echinococcus</italic> as well.

 </sup> Even without a host, some parasites can survive in resistant, dormant stages until a suitable host is found, and a warmer climate will definitely assist to perpetuate those stages.
