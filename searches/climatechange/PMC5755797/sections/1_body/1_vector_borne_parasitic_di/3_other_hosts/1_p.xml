<p class="p">Snails are key intermediate hosts for 
 <italic class="italic">Fasciola</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma</italic> parasites, with the local freshwater snail proportion typically directly related to that of the parasites.

 </sup> The ability to maintain viable snail populations is dependent on water velocity, rainfall, and temperature.

 </sup> It has been observed that snails require a relatively low water velocity and rainfall with moderate to warm temperatures, as snails in Nigeria were most abundant at the beginning of the dry season, and incidence of schistosomiasis followed this same time trend.

 </sup> It is expected that climate change will cause water stress in some areas which could increase freshwater snail populations and disease incidence. Risk modeling has shown that while some of Northeastern Africa may see a decline in the risk of schistosomiasis infection, Southeastern Africa is at particular risk of increased infection rates of schistosomiasis and new areas are likely to become endemic with warming temperatures.

 </sup> A modeling study for China showed similar trends, with the new areas at risk of schistosomiasis infection due to temperature increase accounting for an additional 8.1% of the surface area of China as expansion occurs north to currently nonendemic areas.

 </sup> Farther from the equator, lymnaeid snails, intermediate hosts for 
 <italic class="italic">Fasciola hepatica</italic>, also seem to be benefiting from a changing climate. The abundance of these snails is related to air and water temperature as well as soil evapotranspiration.

 </sup> We will discuss fascioliasis in greater detail in the subsequent section on economic impacts.
