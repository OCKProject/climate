<p class="p">Macroscopic parasites directly interact with their environments when part of their life cycle occurs outside of a host. Helminths such as hookworms, 
 <italic class="italic">Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Trichuris trichuria</italic> are present in soils before infecting a host, and certain soil components may be fundamentally altered by a changing climate.

 </sup> Higher temperatures can cause faster larvae development and development within eggs for hookworms, which ultimately decreases their time to infectivity.

 </sup> Increased precipitation levels could prevent desiccation of eggs/larvae thus allowing greater survival rates of these parasites.

 </sup> Similarly, increased humidity levels would increase larval survival in soil, especially for hookworms as their larvae are at a greater risk of desiccation compared with other helminth species.
