<p class="p">After extensive deforestation in Haiti and political turmoil that prevented proper landscape maintenance, the River Royone began to more frequently flood the nearby community, with a resulting significant increase in the prevalence of hookworm infections.

 </sup> Previously, hookworm infections had not been common in the area for some time, and it was determined that the change in soil content and moisture from the flooding river had contributed to and facilitated this reemergence.

 </sup> In the 6â€‰years following the floods, hookworm prevalence increased from 0% to 12% to 15%, whereas other helminthic infections remained relatively constant.

 </sup> This case demonstrates how the combination of altered environments and extreme weather events can have dramatic, lasting effects on community health. With that information, it is possible to assume that climate changes promoting lower precipitation and humidity levels would decrease infection rates with hookworms, 
 <italic class="italic">A lumbricoides</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">T trichuria</italic>, but this may not actually ring true. Regions that are likely to receive very little precipitation, thereby experiencing droughts, will have inadequate resources to maintain personal hygiene, potentially exacerbating the prevalence of infections by 
 <italic class="italic">A lumbricoides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T trichuria</italic>, etc.
