<p class="p">Protozoa that are exposed directly to the environment undergo a cyst or oocyst stage as a part of their life cycle, these stages providing varying degrees of resilience for the parasite and allowing its viability outside of a host species. Giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, amebiasis, and toxoplasmosis can all be transmitted through contaminated drinking water.

 </sup> Climate change may place a strain on agricultural industries as they try to retain crop productivity during droughts or periods of intense precipitation. To compensate for these crop stresses, increased fertilizer use is encouraged.

 </sup> Animal fertilizers, as well as human biosolids used as fertilizers, have the potential to contain parasitic cysts and oocysts. Heavy rainfall events, which may increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, will more often wash fertilizers into local waterways.
