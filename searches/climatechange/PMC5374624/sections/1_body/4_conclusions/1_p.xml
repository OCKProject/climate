<p class="p">This study found most CDC staff endorsed the statement that climate change has had a negative impact on infectious disease transmission. Malaria is reportedly re-emerging in some areas. However, high densities of mosquitoes and the continuous increase in imported cases of malaria in local areas are critical challenges to malaria control. Further efforts in mosquito density control, imported case surveillance and management, regional cooperation for malaria control and information sharing, climate change-related research and monitoring of potential re-emerging malaria areas are urgently needed. Additionally, comprehensive response measures considering issues of urbanization, internal migrant population, working and living conditions and optimized health promotion strategies are likely to be fruitful in building the capacity of infectious disease control to curb the possible health impact of emerging and re-emerging malaria in China.</p>
