 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. The full questionnaire explored participants’ beliefs about climate change, which infectious disease(s) would most likely be affected by climate change; perceptions of disease control and prevention; and suggested strategies to strengthen the current capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The questionnaire also included five open-ended response questions, which provided opportunities for participants to comment more openly on infectious disease risk factors. The questionnaire was designed in English and then translated into Chinese. Experts in the China National CDC validated the draft questionnaire, and relevant revisions were made in accordance with recommendations of experts. The questionnaire was then piloted among 18 internal staff in the China National CDC. The results of the pilot testing showed that the questionnaire was clear and well understood. This study reports on a subset of questions relating to malaria and climate change. The relevant section of the questionnaire is included in Additional file
