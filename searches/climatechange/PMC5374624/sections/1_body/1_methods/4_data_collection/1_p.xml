<p class="p">Three well-trained researchers conducted the fieldwork in China in May 2015. In order to facilitate the questionnaire distribution and to maximize response rates, investigators made contacts with the principal informants working in the selected CDCs and briefly introduced the surveyâ€™s aims and main content, then invited them and their colleagues to participate. Participation was voluntary, and no incentives were offered. As responses were anonymous, participants were given clear instructions not to include any personal identifying information on the questionnaire. In total, 624 questionnaires were distributed and later collected from the participating CDCs. All questionnaires were collected, 557 were complete, 67 questionnaires were incomplete. Therefore, the response rate for this study was 89.3%.</p>
