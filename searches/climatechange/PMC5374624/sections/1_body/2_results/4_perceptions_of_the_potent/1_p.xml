<p class="p">The perceived main risk factors for malaria in China were explored with an open-ended question. Participants were asked ‘What do you think are the main risk factors for malaria in your region?’ Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> summarizes these results. The most frequently reported risk factor for malaria in China was mosquitoes in high-density (23.5%), and 21.9% of participants believed imported case of malaria from overseas was a risk factor. Furthermore, 12.8% of participants implicated climate change, 10.6% thought poor environmental conditions, and 8.8% indicated internal migrant population and lack of health awareness as other significant risk factors for malaria. In addition, 12% of participants also thought insufficient control measures, numerous mosquito breeding sites, poor living conditions, poor management of imported cases and geographical factors could contribute to the transmission of malaria.
