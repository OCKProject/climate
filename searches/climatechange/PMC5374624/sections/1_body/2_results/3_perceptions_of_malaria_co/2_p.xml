<p class="p">Participants from Anhui Province were less likely to indicate that malaria had re-emerged in their jurisdiction (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 26.24, p &lt; 0.001), than those in Henan and Yunnan province. Regarding the perceived geographical expansion of malaria, about 36% of participants from Henan and Yunnan indicated that they believed malaria had moved into new geographic areas, while significantly fewer (17.4%) participants held this view in Anhui (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 18.23, p = 0.001). Twenty per cent of participants from Anhui indicated that malaria occurrences were arising at unusual times of the year, and more participants in Henan (26.8%) and Yunnan (33.8%) held this opinion. More than two-thirds (73.2%) of participants thought current prevention methods and the National Malaria Programme were effective in reducing the incidence of malaria, and the majority (64.5%) of participants indicated that the local residents in the population were well informed about how to reduce the risk of malaria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Moreover, compared with other CDC staff, these who were directly related to the frontline work of disease control CDC staff were more likely to indicate that malaria had re-emerged in their regions in recent years (see Additional file
