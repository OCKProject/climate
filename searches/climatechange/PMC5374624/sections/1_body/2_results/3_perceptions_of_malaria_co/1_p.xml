<p class="p">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, overall, about half (52.4%) of the CDC staff thought the number of mosquitoes had increased over the past 10 years—more in Yunnan, than in Henan and Anhui. There was no significant difference across these three provinces about the participants’ perception (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 4.57, p = 0.335). However, the number of mosquito-borne diseases was perceived to be highest (55.2%) in Yunnan (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 14.49, p = 0.006), and correspondingly fewer participants from Yunnan CDCs claimed there were enough vector control programmes implemented, compared with those from other provinces. About 60% of those from Anhui and Yunnan indicated that mosquito-borne diseases had increased and that this was attributable to climate change while fewer (47.3%) participants from Henan held this opinion.
