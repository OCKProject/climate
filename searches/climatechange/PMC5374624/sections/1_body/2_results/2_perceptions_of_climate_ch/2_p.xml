<p class="p">CDC staff’s perceptions of the impact of climate change on public health are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Overall, 500 participants (90.3%) indicated climate change would have a negative effect on population health, 514 (92.6%) and 481 (86.8%) participants stated that predicted temperature increases and precipitation would influence the transmission of infectious diseases. Most participants (86.1%) agreed that climate change would increase the transmission of vector-borne diseases, and 83.9% expected that climate change would promote malaria transmission. Also, such perceptions were consistent across participants from different CDCs. We also found no significant difference in the perceptions of climate change between these who work in the frontline for disease control and other CDC staff.
