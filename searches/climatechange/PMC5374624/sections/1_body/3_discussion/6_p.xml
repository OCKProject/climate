<p class="p">This study has several limitations. Firstly, the study participants were from 11 selected CDC, and the result may not be entirely representative of all CDC staff. Secondly, although the study started with a relatively large number of health professionals, the county-level and prefectural-level CDC sample was comparatively small compared with the provincial-level CDC. Future studies could enlarge the samples to recruit more county-level and prefectural-level CDC staff who are working on the frontline for disease control and prevention. Thirdly, the questionnaire survey was conducted in Chinese, and there may be some minor anomalies in translation. Fourthly, response biases may happen as participants may overestimate or underestimate their knowledge and competence. Furthermore, as malaria cases have decreased in China between 2007 and 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) the terms “re-emerged” and “in recent years” in the questionnaire could be viewed subjectively by participants and could be taken to mean the last 15 years or since the 2006 peak. Nevertheless, this study represents health professionals’ perception of infectious disease control and prevention in the face of climate change and also indicates a significant finding that CDC staff may benefit from more scientific information on climate change that, in turn, may help improve the capacity for malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change in China.
