<p class="p">About half of the participants indicated they thought the number of mosquitoes had increased over the past 10Â years in their regions, despite some vector control programmes being implemented in place. This increase could be due to different reasons, such as urbanization, landscape changes, and the reduction of biodiversity [

Some participants stated that mosquito-borne diseases had increased over the period, and this perception was highest in Yunnan Province compared to the other two provinces. This could be due to hotter, more humid weather in Southwest China and numerous imported cases from neighbouring epidemic countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos [

Among those participants who believed mosquito-borne diseases had increased, more than half considered the increase was associated with climate change. Studies have found that climate change-induced warmer weather accelerates mosquito life cycles, hastens the development of the malaria parasite within the vector, and contributes to mosquito breeding and biting, and thus disease transmission [
