<p class="p">The perceived risk factors yielded from open-ended questions are consistent with other studies showing risk factors associated with emergence and re-emergence of malaria in China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. High densities of infected 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes would significantly contribute to the transmission of malaria, and this has been considered one of the most important factors leading to increased incidence of malaria worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Moreover, CDC staff indicated that malaria control and prevention has been severely jeopardized by the growing number of imported cases of malaria, which has also been highlighted by other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. This trend of imported malaria to China has increased gradually since 2006. In 2014, the imported cases of malaria accounted for 98.1% of all malaria cases in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. This implies that action is needed to curb the increasing numbers of imported cases by warning outgoing travelers to avoid potential risk areas or take necessary preventive measures, screening incoming international travelers and returning Chinese workers from overseas to detect and treat cases, and identify types of imported cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. In addition, regional cooperation at the policy level, especially between China and its neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos, is very important, in terms of establishment of a similar surveillance system for information exchange, regional collaboration for vector control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Furthermore, more attention to climate change, environmental improvement, internal migrant populations, and health education programmes would also be necessary to reduce the incidence of malaria in China.
