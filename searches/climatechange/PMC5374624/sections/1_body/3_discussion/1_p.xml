<p class="p">This is the first study to explore CDC staff’s views and understanding of climate change and the transmission of malaria in China. Results showed most participants in our survey were either concerned (50.5%) or very concerned (29.3%) about climate change, and about 19% of participants were slightly concerned. The majority (79.7%) of participants indicated they thought the weather was becoming warmer. However, perceived knowledge of climate change was limited. Less than one-third of participants (31.1%) reported they had a good understanding of climate change and nearly 90%, especially females and new staff, indicated they need more information about climate change impacts. Further in-house training activities could be promoted to improve staff’s knowledge and understanding of climate change. This is consistent with other studies highlighting the need for training and education among CDC staff [
