<p class="p">The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an official health agency to protect and improve public health and safety by providing information to enhance health decisions, and promote health through partnerships with provincial health departments and other organizations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. One of the significant duties of CDC is infectious disease surveillance, control, and prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. There are three levels of CDCs in each Province: a provincial-level CDC, prefectural-level CDCs and county/district-level CDCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. The main duties of the provincial-level CDC include the guidance of disease control and prevention across the Province, the provision of professional management, technical support and organizational coordination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Prefectural-level CDCs and county/district-level CDCs are directly responsible for frontline work of infectious disease detection, response, control and elimination, and outbreak investigation in local areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Consequently, CDC staff are likely to be sensitive to emerging and re-emerging infectious disease threats, and it would be valuable to explore their perceptions of infectious disease control and prevention in the face of climate change.
