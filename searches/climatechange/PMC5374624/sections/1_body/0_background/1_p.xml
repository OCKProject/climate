<p class="p">Climate change is one of the most critical challenges confronting the world today. The process of rapid development and excessive human activities have caused an increase of 0.85 ± 0.2 °C in global mean temperature over the period from 1880 to 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. In China, the average surface temperature has increased 1.3 °C over the past 58 years (1951–2008) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] and rapid economic development has been accompanied by landscape changes, environmental degradation, increased urbanization and frequent natural disasters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Precipitation has declined in southern parts of China over the last century but increased by 22–33% in north-west China [

The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) in 2014 has predicted an increase of 1.1–6.4 °C in the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1990 to 2100 and about 0.4–6 °C increase is projected for China over the period [
