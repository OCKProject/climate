Descriptive analysis was performed to study CDC staff&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and suggestions for malaria control in the face of climate change.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A majority (79.8%) of CDC staff were concerned about climate change and 79.7% believed the weather was becoming warmer. Most participants (90.3%) indicated climate change had a negative effect on population health, 92.6 and 86.8% considered that increasing temperatures and precipitation would influence the transmission of vector-borne diseases including malaria. About half (50.9%) of the surveyed staff indicated malaria had re-emerged in recent years, and some outbreaks were occurring in new geographic areas. The main reasons for such re-emergence were perceived to be: mosquitoes in high-density, numerous imported cases, climate change, poor environmental conditions, internal migrant populations, and lack of health awareness.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found most CDC staff endorsed the statement that climate change had a negative impact on infectious disease transmission. Malaria had re-emerged in some areas of China, and most of the staff believed that this can be managed. However, high densities of mosquitoes and the continuous increase in imported cases of malaria in local areas, together with environmental changes are bringing about critical challenges to malaria control in China. This study contributes to an understanding of climate change related perceptions of malaria control and prevention amongst CDC staff. It may help to formulate in-house training guidelines, community health promotion programmes and policies to improve the capacity of malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12936-017-1790-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Imported cases</kwd><kwd>Capacity building</kwd><kwd>Perception</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government (AU)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Project ID: 66888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bi</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 2012CB955504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Climate change is one of the most critical challenges confronting the world today. The process of rapid development and excessive human activities have caused an increase of 0.85&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in global mean temperature over the period from 1880 to 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In China, the average surface temperature has increased 1.3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C over the past 58&#x000a0;years (1951&#x02013;2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and rapid economic development has been accompanied by landscape changes, environmental degradation, increased urbanization and frequent natural disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Precipitation has declined in southern parts of China over the last century but increased by 22&#x02013;33% in north-west China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) in 2014 has predicted an increase of 1.1&#x02013;6.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1990 to 2100 and about 0.4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C increase is projected for China over the period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Climate change has had a negative influence on the transmission of infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>One of the concerns of health authorities in China is the possible influence of climate change on vector-borne diseases, especially malaria, a mosquito-borne disease which the authorities aim to eradicate by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease, which has been a serious public health problem in China and many other countries. <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> are two predominant species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the primary vectors are <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito species breeding in the streams, pools, paddy fields and other water bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Considerable efforts have been made to address this public health issue in China, which has resulted in a significant decline in its occurrence during the 1980s and 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The reduction in malaria is considered to have been due to exponential improvements in the socioeconomic status and public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, early this century there was a re-emergence of the disease over several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Malaria incidence rapidly increased after 2000 and reached its peak in 2006, during which there were 64,178 cases reported in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Incidence then decreased markedly between 2007 and 2014 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) when there were 3078 cases reported, most being concentrated in the southwest region&#x02014;Yunnan Province, central and east region&#x02014;Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu provinces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Possible reasons for this re-emergence may include meteorological factors, climate change, increased mosquitoes and imported cases, as studies in China have indicated that these factors could have impacts on the transmission of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Given the high-density population, rapid economic development, urbanization and increasing numbers of international travelers in China, there is an urgent need to understand the effectiveness of current infectious disease control and prevention of malaria in the face of climate change.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of malaria cases in China 2000&#x02013;2014.

</p><p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an official health agency to protect and improve public health and safety by providing information to enhance health decisions, and promote health through partnerships with provincial health departments and other organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One of the significant duties of CDC is infectious disease surveillance, control, and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are three levels of CDCs in each Province: a provincial-level CDC, prefectural-level CDCs and county/district-level CDCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The main duties of the provincial-level CDC include the guidance of disease control and prevention across the Province, the provision of professional management, technical support and organizational coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Prefectural-level CDCs and county/district-level CDCs are directly responsible for frontline work of infectious disease detection, response, control and elimination, and outbreak investigation in local areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consequently, CDC staff are likely to be sensitive to emerging and re-emerging infectious disease threats, and it would be valuable to explore their perceptions of infectious disease control and prevention in the face of climate change.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate perceptions of CDC staff regarding climate change and malaria control and prevention in China. The findings of this survey highlight the perceptions of China CDC staff of infectious disease control and prevention in the light of climate change. The collective knowledge and experience of the staff may prove useful in preparing for possible increases in malaria and assist policy-makers to formulate adaptation strategies for malaria in China in the context of a changing climate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A questionnaire instrument was administrated to CDC staff in China.

The full questionnaire explored participants&#x02019; beliefs about climate change, which infectious disease(s) would most likely be affected by climate change; perceptions of disease control and prevention; and suggested strategies to strengthen the current capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The questionnaire also included five open-ended response questions, which provided opportunities for participants to comment more openly on infectious disease risk factors. The questionnaire was designed in English and then translated into Chinese. Experts in the China National CDC validated the draft questionnaire, and relevant revisions were made in accordance with recommendations of experts. The questionnaire was then piloted among 18 internal staff in the China National CDC. The results of the pilot testing showed that the questionnaire was clear and well understood. This study reports on a subset of questions relating to malaria and climate change. The relevant section of the questionnaire is included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population was health professionals in China CDCs whose roles included infectious disease control and prevention, public health, medical laboratory examination and emergency response in their CDCs. Eleven CDCs were involved in this study; three provincial CDCs in Anhui, Henan, and Yunnan Provinces, four prefectural, and county CDCs in the provinces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The targeted CDCs in Anhui, Henan and Yunnan provinces were selected through discussion with key informants in the China National CDC. These provinces were selected as they had a high incidence of malaria at the time of the study and it was thought that participants could provide informed responses as they had direct experience to deal with malaria.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Study sites and sampling CDCs in China</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2017_1790_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

Overall, 500 participants (90.3%) indicated climate change would have a negative effect on population health, 514 (92.6%) and 481 (86.8%) participants stated that predicted temperature increases and precipitation would influence the transmission of infectious diseases. Most participants (86.1%) agreed that climate change would increase the transmission of vector-borne diseases, and 83.9% expected that climate change would promote malaria transmission. Also, such perceptions were consistent across participants from different CDCs.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to explore CDC staff&#x02019;s views and understanding of climate change and the transmission of malaria in China. Results showed most participants in our survey were either concerned (50.5%) or very concerned (29.3%) about climate change, and about 19% of participants were slightly concerned. The majority (79.7%) of participants indicated they thought the weather was becoming warmer. However, perceived knowledge of climate change was limited. Less than one-third of participants (31.1%) reported they had a good understanding of climate change and nearly 90%, especially females and new staff, indicated they need more information about climate change impacts. Further in-house training activities could be promoted to improve staff&#x02019;s knowledge and understanding of climate change. This is consistent with other studies highlighting the need for training and education among CDC staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The vast majority of participants indicated climate change would have an adverse impact on population health, and increase the transmission of infectious diseases, which is line with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In particular, 92.6 and 86.8% of participants indicated increasing temperatures and rainfall would influence infectious disease transmission. Furthermore, over 80% of participants believed that climate change would affect vector-borne diseases, including the transmission of malaria. These findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid to malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change to meet the goal of the China National Malaria Elimination Programme by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>About half of the participants indicated they thought the number of mosquitoes had increased over the past 10&#x000a0;years in their regions, despite some vector control programmes being implemented in place. This increase could be due to different reasons, such as urbanization, landscape changes, and the reduction of biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It may also indicate that current vector control programmes need to be further improved. Some participants stated that mosquito-borne diseases had increased over the period, and this perception was highest in Yunnan Province compared to the other two provinces. This could be due to hotter, more humid weather in Southwest China and numerous imported cases from neighbouring epidemic countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], suggesting regional cooperation such as data sharing and information exchange is imperative for malaria and other vector-borne diseases control. Among those participants who believed mosquito-borne diseases had increased, more than half considered the increase was associated with climate change. Studies have found that climate change-induced warmer weather accelerates mosquito life cycles, hastens the development of the malaria parasite within the vector, and contributes to mosquito breeding and biting, and thus disease transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, warmer weather may have also changed human behavior that could contribute to disease transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>More than half the participants from Henan and Yunnan CDCs indicated malaria had re-emerged in recent years. This may be due to the increased number of imported malaria cases from overseas (foreign nationality or Chinese workforce infected overseas) and the risk of transmission of infected individuals present to the local population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, more participants in Henan and Yunnan thought malaria was occurring in new geographic areas, which are consistent with other studies showing that malaria was emerging and re-emerging in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Greater prevention and control efforts should aim to inhibit malaria transmission in these areas. Although other studies also found malaria had re-emerged in Anhui Province since 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], participants from Anhui CDCs in this survey were less likely to claim that malaria re-emergence and geographic expansion had occurred. This could be due to the great reduction of malaria cases in Anhui Province from 34984 in 2006 to only 144 in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hence, CDC staff in Anhui may be less likely to have observed that malaria had re-emerged compared with the other two Provinces. In addition, the current National Malaria Programme and other related prevention and control measures were thought to be effective in reducing malaria incidence by most of the participants in this survey, which could affirm the overall effectiveness of current control plans. However, in other regions such as Yunnan there may be a need for plans to be further improved to meet the aim of malaria elimination. Furthermore, it will be interesting to know the reasons for the different perceptions of the CDC staff between Henan and Anhui Provinces in terms of malaria emergence and re-emergence, and expansion of epidemic foci, because the two Provinces, especially the malaria epidemic foci are next to each other. In addition, frontline CDC staff were more likely to indicate that malaria re-emerged which could be due to the fieldwork experience they had, compared with other workers. More relevant research among frontline staff in the prefecture and county lower-level CDCs should be conducted to assess the re-emergence of malaria in the context of climate change in China.</p><p>The perceived risk factors yielded from open-ended questions are consistent with other studies showing risk factors associated with emergence and re-emergence of malaria in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. High densities of infected <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes would significantly contribute to the transmission of malaria, and this has been considered one of the most important factors leading to increased incidence of malaria worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Moreover, CDC staff indicated that malaria control and prevention has been severely jeopardized by the growing number of imported cases of malaria, which has also been highlighted by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This trend of imported malaria to China has increased gradually since 2006. In 2014, the imported cases of malaria accounted for 98.1% of all malaria cases in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This implies that action is needed to curb the increasing numbers of imported cases by warning outgoing travelers to avoid potential risk areas or take necessary preventive measures, screening incoming international travelers and returning Chinese workers from overseas to detect and treat cases, and identify types of imported cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, regional cooperation at the policy level, especially between China and its neighbouring countries, such as Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos, is very important, in terms of establishment of a similar surveillance system for information exchange, regional collaboration for vector control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, more attention to climate change, environmental improvement, internal migrant populations, and health education programmes would also be necessary to reduce the incidence of malaria in China.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, the study participants were from 11 selected CDC, and the result may not be entirely representative of all CDC staff. Secondly, although the study started with a relatively large number of health professionals, the county-level and prefectural-level CDC sample was comparatively small compared with the provincial-level CDC. Future studies could enlarge the samples to recruit more county-level and prefectural-level CDC staff who are working on the frontline for disease control and prevention. Thirdly, the questionnaire survey was conducted in Chinese, and there may be some minor anomalies in translation. Fourthly, response biases may happen as participants may overestimate or underestimate their knowledge and competence. Furthermore, as malaria cases have decreased in China between 2007 and 2014 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) the terms &#x0201c;re-emerged&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;in recent years&#x0201d; in the questionnaire could be viewed subjectively by participants and could be taken to mean the last 15&#x000a0;years or since the 2006 peak. Nevertheless, this study represents health professionals&#x02019; perception of infectious disease control and prevention in the face of climate change and also indicates a significant finding that CDC staff may benefit from more scientific information on climate change that, in turn, may help improve the capacity for malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found most CDC staff endorsed the statement that climate change has had a negative impact on infectious disease transmission. Malaria is reportedly re-emerging in some areas. However, high densities of mosquitoes and the continuous increase in imported cases of malaria in local areas are critical challenges to malaria control. Further efforts in mosquito density control, imported case surveillance and management, regional cooperation for malaria control and information sharing, climate change-related research and monitoring of potential re-emerging malaria areas are urgently needed. Additionally, comprehensive response measures considering issues of urbanization, internal migrant population, working and living conditions and optimized health promotion strategies are likely to be fruitful in building the capacity of infectious disease control to curb the possible health impact of emerging and re-emerging malaria in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
