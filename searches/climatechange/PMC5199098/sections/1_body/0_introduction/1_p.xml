<p class="p">Geochemical elements are useful indicators of chemical weathering, geological processes and tectonic settings of sedimentary catchments. They can also be used to reconstruct the catchment paleoclimatic and environmental changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Studying the chemical proxies of elements in lacustrine sediments allows us to understand the close interdependence of the Asian monsoon evolution and the global climate changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has always been the object of intense climate research [

 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Previous research suggests that the TP is one of the regulators of global climate [

 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The Xiaozhongdian Basin (XB) is located at the margin of the southeastern TP (SETP), the climate is obviously controlled by the Asian southwest monsoon and local climatic influences of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Recent studies have found that historical records and reconstructions showed that variability in summer monsoon precipitation led to droughts [

 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. And three Quaternary lacustrine deposition cycles and five sand layers have been identified in the XB [
 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to provide high-resolution and typically abundant environmental and climatic information to study the impact of the TP on the climatic events of the southwest Asian monsoon (SWAM) region, and it is critical to be able to evaluate the influence of global change on regional climate.
