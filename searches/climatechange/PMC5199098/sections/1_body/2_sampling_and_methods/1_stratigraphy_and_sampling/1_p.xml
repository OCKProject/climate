<p class="p">A 15.3-m section along the Jinsha River (27°36’54”N, 99°45’45”E, ~3300 m asl) was excavated in the XB to obtain samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168928.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The top of the section is developed recent soil with massive texture, aggregated structure and abundant plant roots from a depth of 0 to 0.4 m. The section is light grayish green in color and it is mainly composed of silty clay. There are five coarse silt layers in the middle of the section, with thicknesses of 1.7–2.2 m, 3.2–3.5 m, 7–7.2 m, 11.8–12.2 m and 14.2–14.3 m, respectively. The layer between 14.7 and 15.2 m is black clay with enriched carbon. A total of 62 samples were collected from the section at depth intervals of 25 cm for analysis of the geochemical elements. No specific permissions are required for our study locations and sampling activities.
