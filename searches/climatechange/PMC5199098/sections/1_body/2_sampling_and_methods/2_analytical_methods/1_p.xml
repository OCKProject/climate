<p class="p">The carbonates in the samples were removed from the samples using 1 mol/L HCl before the analysis and were repeated twice. All subsamples consisting of 4 g of each sample (&lt;75 Î¼m) were pressurized with boric acid to 30 t/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for 20 s. The elemental analysis of the samples was performed using a Philips PW2403 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscope. The analyzed oxide compounds are identified in elemental form in the Results and Discussion section below. Repeated analyses were performed for every 10 samples to verify the reliability and accuracy of the analytical data. The method has been used to the analysis of standard samples (lake sediment of the national soil standard reference material, GSS-9) with relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 2%.
