<p class="p">By comparing research conducted in the study region and other regions, the TP can be considered a climate regulator that enlarged or reduced the signals associated with the suction action during the H and D/O events. The forms of the climatic events in the various regions of China are related to the effect of the suction action of the TP. The record of the Heinrich events of the SETP indicated more substantial drought events. The warmer climate further increased the evaporation of the study area, which was amplifying the degree of drought. However, the regional records for other regions of China have indicated rapid cooling because of the less pronounced effect by the TP. It would be beneficial to explore the regional climate characteristics and their relationships with the global patterns.</p>
