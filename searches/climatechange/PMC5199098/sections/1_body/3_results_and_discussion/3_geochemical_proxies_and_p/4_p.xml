<p class="p">The different minerals have different ICV intervals, the ICV of non-clay minerals is higher than that of clay minerals, and the ICV of pyroxene is between 10 and 100. The ICV values for amphibole, K feldspar, plagioclase, and illite/muscovite are 8, 1, 0.6 and 0.3, respectively, and the range of CIV values for montmorillonite and kaolinite are only 0.15–0.3 and 0.03–0.05, respectively. The high ICV value indicates the intensity of chemical weathering, and reflects the optimal hydrothermal quality for the climatic conditions of the XB [

The ICV values of XB show an increasing trend from the bottom to the top of the section. The results of the correlation analyses of the proxies indicated good correlations between ICV and Ti and between ICV and CIA, with R
