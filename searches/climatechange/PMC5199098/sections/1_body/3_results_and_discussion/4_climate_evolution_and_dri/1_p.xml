<p class="p">The chemical weathering process and the history of environmental change of the XB between 42.6 and 11 ka cal. BP were reconstructed based on the geochemical characteristics and other climate proxies combined with the regional research [

The coarse silt layers in the middle of the section records the multiple extreme climate events of XB, and eventually lead to the disappearance of Xiaozhongdian paleolake. The records of Heinrich events in the lacustrine deposits are particularly noticeable in the section. Previous studies have shown that the records of Heinrich events were difference in the world. The records of Heinrich events were represented as drought in the Bay of Bengal region and India [

In general, the instabilities of the climatic characteristics of the SWAM are mainly affected by the interaction among ice sheets, the ocean and the atmosphere and the climate signals of high latitudes passing to low latitudes through thermohaline circulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The TP can be regarded as a regulator that enlarged or reduced the signals during the H events in the SETP [
 <xref rid="pone.0168928.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. During the H events, the cold signals were transmitted from the high latitudes of the North Atlantic to the TP. In turn, this effect caused the cooling effect to be very strong on the TP as a result of the upper-level westerly jet stream and then reduced the suction action associated with the SWAM [
