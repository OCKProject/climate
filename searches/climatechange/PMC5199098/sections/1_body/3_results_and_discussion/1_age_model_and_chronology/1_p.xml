<p class="p">The measured dates of the study section are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0168928.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The ages and the records of the environmental proxies indicate there was continuous sedimentation that extended back to ~42.6 cal ka BP based on the Bayesian model of age-depth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168928.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The sedimentation rate in the section is approximately and 0.385 and 0.461 mm/a. The estimated sedimentation rate corresponds with other geochronology in Yunnan Province [
