 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168928.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. The total oxide content of the samples ranges from 90.56% to 93.15%, with an average value of 91.76%. SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has the highest content of all the analyzed major elements and ranges from 53.51% to 65.40%, with an average value of 57.23%, followed by Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, with an average content of 14.09%. The regularity of the abundance of oxide compounds in the XB section was as follows: SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>&gt;Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>&gt;Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>&gt;CaO&gt;MgO&gt;K

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>&gt;Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O&gt;MnO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. In addition, the content of each element indicated substantial fluctuations for the five sand layers, especially the element Ti, which is generally recognized as being mainly derived from the lake sediments.
