<p class="p">Climatic variables included 19 derived bioclimatic variables that describe annual and seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation, as well as elevation, averaged for 1950–2000 (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). One concern when modeling species distributions is the strong correlation that occurs between multiple climate variables, which can significantly influence model predictions of species distributions [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. To test for co-linearity, we performed spatial autocorrelation statistics between all pairs of the 19 bioclimate variables using ESRI ArcMap 10.0. We then selected the most biologically meaningful variable for each group of two or more variables with Pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0.7 (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). This allowed us to reduce the number of bioclimate variables to the nine potentially most important ones, which were: Minimum Temperature of Coldest Month, Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, Precipitation of Wettest Month, Precipitation of Driest Month, Precipitation of Driest Quarter, Isothermality, Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (maximum temperature—minimum temperature)), Temperature Annual Range, and Annual Precipitation, along with elevation (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). These variables are typically considered to be important determinants of butterfly distributions, as they relate to life history traits. Butterflies are highly sensitive to weather and climate, particularly changes in temperature and rainfall [
 <xref rid="B53-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. For example, mean temperature of the coldest month is related to the overwintering survival of first instar larvae, growing degree days above 5 °C are regarded as a surrogate for the developmental threshold of the larvae, water balance corresponds to the moisture availability for the larval host and adult nectar plants, and the mean temperature of late summer ensures proper adult emergence and mating [
