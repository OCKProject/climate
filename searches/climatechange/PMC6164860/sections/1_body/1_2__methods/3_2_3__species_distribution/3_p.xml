<p class="p">One concern when modeling species distributions is whether the occurrence records are spatially biased with respect to site accessibility (e.g., towns, roads, trails) [
 <xref rid="B63-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. To address this concern, we applied a spatial filter to remove all sampling points that were within 5 km of each other using ESRI ArcMap 10.0. The spatial filter resulted in 254 unique presence points for 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> that were used in the final model. We first modeled the distribution of these 254 occurrences in present-day climate, and then projected the fitted species distribution under two future climate scenarios for the period 2040â€“2069 (hereafter referred to as 2050). Future climate scenarios were taken from two global circulation models (GCMs) obtained from 
 <uri xlink:href="www.worldclim.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.org</uri>; the community climate system model (CCSM) [

 <xref rid="B66-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. These GCMs differ in the reconstruction of several climatic variables and are well known to produce different outcomes for butterfly species [

 <xref rid="B68-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. For example, in hind-casting Mediterranean butterflies, the CCSM model projects narrower distributions at the last glacial maximum than does MIROC [

 <xref rid="B66-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. For each of these two GCMs, we considered two different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) [

These pathways were developed for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [
