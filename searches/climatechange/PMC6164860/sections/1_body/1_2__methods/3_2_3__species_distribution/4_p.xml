 <xref rid="B50-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and a ten-fold cross-validation approach to further reduce bias with respect to locality data. This method divides presence data into ten equal partitions, with nine used to train the model, and the tenth used to test it. These partitions generate ten maps (one map per run), with each raster grid cell containing a value representing the probability of occurrence. These values were used to designate habitat suitability ranging from 0 (unsuitable habitat) to 1 (highly suitable habitat) (
