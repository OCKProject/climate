<p class="p">We searched for all known records of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic>, from publications, catalogued and uncatalogued specimens in public and private collections in the United States and Europe, online databases, contemporary field surveys by scientists and amateurs, and our own field surveys. We obtained distributional data from 1323 pinned 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> specimens from 33 natural history museum collections in the United States and Europe (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Four hundred thirty-five additional records (1938–2012) were provided by the Butterfly and Moth Information Network and the participants who contribute to its BAMONA project. Our literature survey produced 153 records (1818–2011) across 54 U.S. counties (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We also collected 469 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> butterflies in our own field surveys (
 <xref rid="insects-09-00094-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Our dataset essentially represents a complete dataset of all publicly available records for the species, and is as comprehensive as for any taxon in the region [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. For this reason, our dataset should be especially informative in creating an accurate bioclimate envelope for the species, as collection bias is a major consideration with ecological niche modeling [
