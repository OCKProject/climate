 <xref rid="B28-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Maxent works by comparing climate data from occurrence sites with those from a random sample of sites from the larger landscape to minimize the relative entropy of statistical models’ fit to each data set. Species distribution models such as Maxent have been criticized for being overly simplistic, because they do not incorporate external biotic factors such as species interactions [
