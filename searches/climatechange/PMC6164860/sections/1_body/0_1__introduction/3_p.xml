 <italic class="italic">Speyeria diana</italic> (Nymphalidae) (Cramer 1777) is a butterfly species endemic to the southeastern United States and is currently threatened across portions of its range. This species is of particular conservation interest because it has experienced a range collapse in recent decades resulting in an 800-km geographic and genetic disjunction between western populations in the Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and populations in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and has shifted to a higher elevation at an estimated rate of 18 m per decade [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This range contraction is consistent with the predicted effects of a warming climate, and might represent the first such documented case in the southeastern United States, though the region has experienced other environmental changes in recent decades as well [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Previous research using coalescent-based population divergence models dated the earliest splitting of the western population from the east at least 20,000 years ago, during the last glacial maximum [

 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> further support this long-term spatial and genetic isolation [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In light of these pieces of evidence, we used Maxent to model the future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> under several future climatic scenarios, in order to forecast how the range of the butterfly might shift under predicted conditions. Forecasts of large range reductions (over 50%), or small overlaps between current and future ranges (less than 50%), would suggest high vulnerability to climate change. Range reductions of any size in the western distribution would likely threaten those populations that are genetically isolated and adapted to relatively low dispersal, with the negative effects of genetic drift [
