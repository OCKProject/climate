<p class="p">Species distributional modeling resulted in “excellent” model fits for 
 <italic class="italic">Speyeria diana</italic>, with a mean AUC = 0.91 ± 0.0028 SE, TSS = 0.87 ± 0.0032 SE for RCP = 4.5; and a mean AUC = 0.87 ± 0.0031 SE, TSS = 0.84 ± 0.0032 SE for RCP = 8.5 (

 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> under both RCPs (17.9%, RCP = 4.5; 19.4%, RCP = 8.5). Among the remaining bioclimatic variables, mean temperature of driest quarter had the next highest average percent contribution (10.3%, RCP = 4.5; 25.0%, RCP = 8.5), followed by minimum temperature of coldest month (20.1%, RCP = 4.5; 10.4%, RCP = 8.5), isothermality (7.3%, RCP = 4.5; 7.6%, RCP = 8.5), precipitation of wettest month (3.5%, RCP = 4.5; 3.9%, RCP = 8.5), precipitation of driest month (1.4%, RCP = 4.5; 5.4%, RCP = 8.5), precipitation of driest quarter (3.3%, RCP = 4.5; 2.4%, RCP = 8.5), Elev (1.5%, RCP = 4.5; 3.5%, RCP = 8.5), mean diurnal range (1.8%, RCP = 4.5; 2.8%, RCP = 8.5), and temperature annual range (1.6%, RCP = 4.5; 1.3%, RCP = 8.5) (
