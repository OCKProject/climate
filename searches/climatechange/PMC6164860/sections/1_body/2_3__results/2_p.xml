The MIROC model resulted in more loss of suitable habitat than CCSM under both RCP scenarios (88.2% versus 92.4% of suitable habitat retained for RCP 4.5, and 90.2% versus 94.3% of suitable habitat retained for RCP 8.5 in CCSM and MIROC, respectively). Both climate models indicate that the loss of core distributional area is modest, with an average of 91.3% of present distributional areas retained. The most drastic reduction in habitat is apparent across the southern Appalachian Mountains (
