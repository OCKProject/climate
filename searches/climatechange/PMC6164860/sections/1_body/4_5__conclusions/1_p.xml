<p class="p">These results highlight the importance of maintaining connectivity of the suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic>, especially in the eastern populations that appear most vulnerable to increased fragmentation and loss of suitable habitat. These populations in the eastern distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> harbor important genetic diversity that may become lost through genetic drift if these populations become small and isolated. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Missouri appear to be least vulnerable to loss of suitable habitat from climate change, and therefore will be important for the future conservation of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> after 2050. As a result of the geographic and genetic isolation of the western populations, conservation of suitable habitat in the west is equally as important as in the east. Our climate models show that the 800-km disjunction across the center of the range of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> is not due to complete absence of suitable habitat, but more probably a result of the extensive habitat fragmentation regionally across the Ohio River Valley from agricultural land use change, and other human related factors that were not included in our models. We conclude that maintaining well-connected low and high elevation habitats across the entire distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana,</italic> both now and into the future, will be necessary for this species, even under conservative forecasts of climate change.
