<p class="p">Our ecological niche models predicted that the amount of suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">Speyeria diana</italic> will decline substantially by the year 2050 across its entire distribution. Both CCSM and MIROC climate models predicted severe habitat loss and fragmentation in the southern Appalachian Mountains by 2050, with some range expansion predicted into higher latitudes in both eastern and western populations. High elevation habitat will be an important refuge for the species across the entire distribution, as the range of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> is already shifting to higher elevations at an estimated rate of 18 m per decade [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Recent evidence further suggests that some 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> populations may already be adapting to high elevations, as 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> female forewings from high elevation populations were found to be narrower than low elevation populations, indicating that these females may be more mobile than those from low elevations with wider forewings [
