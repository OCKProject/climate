<p class="p">Unlike populations in the eastern distribution, the wing shape of western populations of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> appears to be better adapted for lower dispersal, which is in alignment with findings that western populations of 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> are both spatially and genetically isolated [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Our models predicted that the southern edge of the highly suitable habitat in the west will recede by 2050; However, as was found in the southern Appalachian Mountains, the suitable habitat was predicted to expand in the higher elevations of the Ozark and Ouachita mountains of Arkansas. The genetic isolation of western populations may ultimately prevent them from adapting to higher elevations as successfully as populations in the eastern distribution of the species. If this is the case, lower elevation populations will be even more vulnerable to climate change than our models predict.
