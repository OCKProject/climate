<p class="p">We would like to note that all ecological niche models should be used and interpreted with caution because of various sources of bias and error that result in inaccurate predictions [

 <xref rid="B79-insects-09-00094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. However, we are confident that the size of our study area, and our uniquely extensive dataset, provide sufficient data to forecast climate-driven range shifts in 
 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> with accuracy. Both global circulation models (CCCM and MIROC) were very closely aligned in their outcomes, indicating strong agreement between them. Climate is well understood to play a primary role in shaping the distributions of species [

 <italic class="italic">S. diana</italic> will decline and become increasingly fragmented by 2050.
