 </sup>. Our results show that the initial conditions (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>) tightly correlated with the projected soil C in the two non-microbial models at global (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8a, c</xref>) and grid scale (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9a, c</xref>), but did not correlate well with the changes in soil C in all the three models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8b, d, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9b, d, f</xref>) except for some low-latitude areas in the conventional model (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9b</xref>). The microbial model’s initial conditions were not correlated well with projected soil C at the global scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8e</xref>) or grid scale (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9e</xref>), except for significant correlations with predicted soil C at high latitudes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9e</xref>). The findings suggest that in general, uncertainty in the initial conditions propagates through the simulation to the projection of future soil C, and this propagation is especially evident in the two non-microbial models.
