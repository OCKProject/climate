 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and soil C changes appear contradicted in the two models, positive in the conventional model but negative in the vertically resolved model. The possible reasoning is that conventional model mainly predicted C loss but vertically resolve model mainly predicted C gain; specifically, in the conventional model, more soil C would be transformed to the passive soil C with larger

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to minimize soil C loss; in the vertically resolved model, larger 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> would cause more C loss to counteract soil C gain. In contrast, neither predicted soil C nor soil C changes were strongly correlated with any single parameter in the microbial model, but weakly associated with parameters related to decomposition of physically and chemically protected soil C. This finding indicates the complexity of process dynamic and interactions in the microbial model.
