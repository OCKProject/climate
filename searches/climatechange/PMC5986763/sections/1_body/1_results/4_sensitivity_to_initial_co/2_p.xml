<p id="Par14" class="p">Besides initial conditions, model parameters are also able to affect predicted soil C or C changes directly or indirectly through influencing initial conditions. In the conventional model, predicted soil C did not significantly correlate with any model parameters, but the initial conditions; changes in soil C were positively associated with 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (decay rate of slow soil C), but negatively with 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (turnover rate of passive soil C) and 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (temperature sensitivity of soil C turnover) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Besides positive correlation with initial conditions in the vertically resolved model, predicted soil C also positively associated with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (diffusivity in non-permafrost soils) and 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, but negatively with 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; like predicted soil C, changes in soil C were positively associated with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, but negative with 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Predicted soil C change weakly associated with 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> (regression coefficient for calculating maximum reaction rate) and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> (coefficient for calculating desorption rate from physically protected soil C to available soil C); projected soil C content had no significantly linear relationships with any of the model parameters (Fig.
