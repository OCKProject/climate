<p id="Par10" class="p">The spatial patterns of the estimated soil C content by the three models were comparable to the soil C database (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, c, e</xref>). The conventional model significantly underestimated soil C in the high latitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) with large errors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). However, the vertically resolved model generated relative small biases and errors in the high latitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref>) due to its vertical dynamics and explicit parameterization for permafrost soil. This finding highlights the advantage of adding soil layers to simulating high latitude soil C. The smaller soil C biases in the high latitude in MIMICS is due partly to the fact that observed soil C down to 1 m depth instead of 3 m was compared with the modeled soil C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e, f</xref>).
