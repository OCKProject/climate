<p id="Par11" class="p">Positive biases compared to the observational data were widespread in the conventional and vertically resolved models in low latitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, c</xref>). In particular, the conventional Century-type model strongly overestimated soil C in tropical and near-coastal areas with large errors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). The similar spatial biases between the two non-microbial models suggest the similarity in their structures. However, compared with the conventional model, the vertically resolved model had smaller errors, showing improvement by explicitly adding soil depth. In contrast to the two non-microbial models, the microbial model estimation showed small biases in the low latitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>) with small errors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>). Overall, MIMICS estimated the best spatial fit to the observational data due possibly to having more parameters and explicit microbial dynamics

 </sup>. As a result, CLM 4.5 and MIMICS generated smaller contemporary global total soil C relative to the observations, while the conventional Century-type model generated greater contemporary global total soil C in comparison to the observations (Supplementary Fig.
