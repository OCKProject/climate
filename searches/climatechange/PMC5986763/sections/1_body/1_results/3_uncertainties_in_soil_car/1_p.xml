<p id="Par12" class="p">To illustrate the impact of parameter uncertainty on long-term soil C projection, we performed forward runs over 21st century with 1000 sets of parameter values drawn from the posterior distribution for each model (Methods). The three models projected substantially different changes and trajectories in global total soil C over 21st century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The conventional model projected consistent soil C loss with the least uncertainty (95% confidence interval: −71 to −17 Pg). Adding vertical resolution or microbial dynamics to the conventional model increased the projection uncertainty (95% confidence interval: −222 to 583 Pg C and −397 to 144 Pg C, respectively) as well as the sign of the soil C-climate feedback depending on parameters. The uncertainties in the vertically resolved model or MIMICS are more than 10 times larger than that in the conventional model. This interesting result shows that using more parameters and more explicit dynamics may lead to a larger prediction uncertainty due to feedbacks in the model dynamics, rather than less.
