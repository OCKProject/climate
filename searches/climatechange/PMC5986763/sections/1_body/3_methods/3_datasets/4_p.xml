<p id="Par47" class="p">The microbial biomass C was used as the steady state in the MIMICS model due to the fast turnover of microbes, which is typically less than 1 year. A global parameter, fr (fraction of r-selection microbial biomass) was multiplied by the microbial biomass database to calculate the r-selection microbial biomass. The remainder is the k-selection microbial biomass. The gridded soil microbial biomass C was in 0.5° resolution and available here

The database was re-gridded to the CLM grid. The soil depth is down to 1 m
