<p id="Par44" class="p">The observations we used were re-gridded top soil organic carbon (0–30 cm, upper panel) and subsoil organic carbon (30–100 cm, lower panel) from HWSD [Food Agriculture Organization, 2012]. The native resolution (30 arc sec) in HWSD was re-gridded to the CLM grid (i.e., 1.25 × 0.94°) by Wieder et al.
