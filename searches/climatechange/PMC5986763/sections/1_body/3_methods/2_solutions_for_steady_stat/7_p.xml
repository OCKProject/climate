<p id="Par43" class="p">Note that all the litter inputs to soils in the three models are the same at grid level to avoid introducing bias into the results among models. The inputs were derived from running CLM 4.5 within 1850–2004. Mean annual input within 1850–2004 were used for steady-state calculation. Specifically, we used the Qian bias-corrected reanalysis dataset

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> to force the CLM 4.5 historical runs. Basically, for the model years 1850–1947, we cycle atmospheric forcing from the period 1948–1972, and use the corresponding atmospheric data for the years 1948–2004.
