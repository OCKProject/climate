<p id="Par54" class="p">We randomly sampled 1000 parameter sets out of the accepted posterior values. With each of the sampled parameter sets, we forced the vertically resolved model with C input and environmental modifiers obtained from CLM 4.5 model under RCP 8.5 from 2005â€“2100. For the conventional and microbial model, we derived total inputs and mean environmental modifiers of all the 10 soil layer to force the two models. For the two non-microbial models, we used a monthly time step. For the microbial model, daily time step was used due to its non-linear nature causing instability for longer time steps.</p>
