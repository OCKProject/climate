<p id="Par53" class="p">The soil C input and environmental modifiers (except the temperature scalar) used to drive the models were derived from running original CLM 4.5 under the worst-case greenhouse gas emission scenario, representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). The atmospheric data were from Community Earth System Model output for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 experiment, which were used to force CLM 4.5 for 2005–2100. We output the soil C input from litter and then used the inputs to drive our soil C models. The spatial and temporal changes in soil temperature, water content, and litter input to soil C within 2005–2100 were presented (Supplementary Figs.
