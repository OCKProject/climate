 </sup>, given that CLM 4.5 and MIMICS outperformed the conventional model in terms of estimation in the spatial distribution of soil C. However, the larger uncertainty in the projection of soil C by the two models also suggests that we need to strike a balance between model complexity and the need to include diverse model structures in order to forecast soil C dynamics with high confidence and low uncertainty. In addition, reducing the uncertainties of the two models require more observations than are available at the present time. Overall, whether vertically resolved models and microbial models are better representations of mechanisms for soil C dynamics remain debatable. However, they represent updated knowledge and important alternate model structures to enhance confidence in prediction. Our findings suggest that the scientific community should include alternative model structures in future ensemble model predictions and comparisons to increase projection confidence.
