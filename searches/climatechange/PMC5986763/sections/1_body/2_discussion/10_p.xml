<p id="Par25" class="p">Another possible limitation relates to the two functional microbial groups in MIMICS. We did not estimate proportion of the microbial functional groups in each grid cell. Instead, we applied a global parameter (fr: proportion of r-selection microbial biomass) to calculate the r-selection microbial biomass, and the remainder is k-selection microbial biomass. We made this assumption due to the uncertainty in the spatial pattern of the relationship between the two microbial functional groups and climate, edaphic properties, and/or vegetation characteristics. Future research may focus on developing relationships between this parameter and climate, soil, and vegetation.</p>
