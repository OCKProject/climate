<p id="Par20" class="p">The lack of constraint on the transfer coefficients in the two non-microbial models indicates that the two opposing mechanisms, transfer coefficient and turnover rate, require more informative data to be disentangled from one another. Substantial uncertainty in predicted soil C dynamics in MIMICS also suggests that additional data are necessary to further constrain parameters. In particular, our results suggest that observations related to the modifiers of microbial maximum uptake rate and half saturation constant are of the most importance to reduce uncertainty. We acknowledge that besides transfer coefficients in the two non-microbial models and the modifiers in the microbial model, data related to other aspects of model processes may be also critical, but not revealed in our study due to model simplification. For example, data related to derivation of soil water scalar such as soil water content and water potential may be needed given that we simplified the calculation of water scalars by directly using the default parameters in the two non-microbial models and that there is under-representation of soil water impact in the microbial model
