<p id="Par18" class="p">The microbial model also predicted wider range of future soil C change and diverse trajectories with both negative and positive feedbacks. This was somewhat expected due to the non-linearity of the C uptake processes by microbes

 </sup>. The large spread in projections of the microbial model also suggests that reducing projection uncertainty requires more observations than are available at the present time in order to better constrain model parameters. Additional datasets are especially needed to tease apart multiple processes and further reduce the uncertainty. Results from this study highlight that data constraints may limit the ability of data assimilation to reduce uncertainty in more complicated model structures.
