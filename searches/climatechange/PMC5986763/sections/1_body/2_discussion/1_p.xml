<p id="Par16" class="p">Substantial uncertainties in soil C-climate feedback existed as a result of different model structures, parameter values, and initial conditions. The conventional Century-type model predicted consistently positive soil C-climate feedback with small uncertainty, which indicates effectiveness of data-driven projections. The consistently positive feedback suggests that the model structure determines the trajectory of soil C response to climate change for this family of models
