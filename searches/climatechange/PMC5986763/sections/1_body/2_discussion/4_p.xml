<p id="Par19" class="p">The large uncertainty in the vertically resolved model and MIMICS might be engendered by either high degrees of model freedom or complex model structures, or both. Many unconstrained parameters due to data limitation, especially in MIMICS, led to the large predicted uncertainty. We therefore anticipate substantial uncertainty reduction in these models once more global data are available to inform the models in the future. On the other hand, the complex model structures may also contribute to the large uncertainty. In a previous study, Hararuk et al.

 </sup> reported small uncertainty in soil C prediction by a conventional model with 20 free parameters. The number of free parameters is comparable to that in MIMICS (22) and is greater than that in the vertically resolved model (13). Therefore, it is likely that the model structures of CLM4.5 and MIMICS at least in part increased the projected uncertainty. In addition, slightly larger uncertainty and fewer model parameters in the vertically resolved model than in the MIMICS also support that the greater uncertainty is likely caused by model structure, if not solely. In contrast to larger uncertainty in CLM 4.5 and MIMICS, both models generated better spatial comparison to soil C observations, which demonstrates model flexibility and encourages further exploration of explicit soil depth and microbial dynamics in soil C model parameterization.
