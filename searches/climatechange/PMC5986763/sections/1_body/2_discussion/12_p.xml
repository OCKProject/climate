<p id="Par27" class="p">In summary, our results demonstrate the importance of model structure and parameterization in determining the predicted soil C response to climate change. CLM4.5 and MIMICS showed much greater uncertainty in projected soil C under RCP 8.5 and the conventional model consistently predicted strong positive C-climate feedback. The close correlations between initial conditions and projected soil C confirm that the projection of soil C is sensitive to initial conditions in the two non-microbial models, whereas the microbial model did not show any linear relationship between initial conditions and projected soil C.</p>
