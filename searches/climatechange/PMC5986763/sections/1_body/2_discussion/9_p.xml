<p id="Par24" class="p">First, we assumed the observed soil C dataset is at steady state due to its heterogeneity in time; second, we also assume the steady state in observed microbial biomass data used in the microbial model (MIMICS) due to the fast turnover rate of microbial processes. The steady-state assumption is convenient when the datasets are highly heterogeneous in time and space, but may introduce uncertainty in projection. Furthermore, these static estimates of soil C and microbial biomass C provide limited insights into the fate of soil C pools and potential microbial activity under climate change. However, it is a common practice so far to make best use of these datasets
