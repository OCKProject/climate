<p id="Par26" class="p">Lastly, we simplified the two non-microbial models in terms of their environmental modifiers, soil water scalar in particular, given data limitation and potential equifinality by the complex calculation of soil water scalar

 </sup>. This simplification may underestimate the uncertainty in predictions by the two models; however, it is less likely for the conventional Century-type model to reach the similar magnitude of uncertainty in MIMICS even with the full representation of soil water scalar due to the large difference.
