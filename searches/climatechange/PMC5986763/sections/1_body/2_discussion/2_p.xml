 </sup>, the soil C decomposition in each layer has the same representation as the conventional model. Inclusion of the vertical dimension may not alter the fundamental behaviors of the model in terms of both steady-state estimation and long-term projection, as the soil C dynamics are still jointly determined by soil C influx and decay rate. In contrast to this hypothesis, adding soil layers to the conventional model allowed for both positive and negative feedbacks, due possibly to the smaller equilibrium soil C predicted by the model. The finding reveals that adding vertical resolution to the C decomposition parameterization can generate diverse responses of soil C to climate change. However, the large spread in projection and lack of constraint on transfer coefficients suggest more relevant data requirement to reduce model uncertainty.
