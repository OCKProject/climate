<p id="Par22" class="p">However, there are limitations with these additional datasets for model-data integration, especially at global scale. Most of these data are collected at small spatial scales, and hence may not provide a good global parameter constraint. Linking data at the micro-scale to the intermediate and large scales presents significant challenges for primarily two reasons: (1) lack of effective upscaling scheme may introduce additional uncertainty to the data; (2) data assimilation using global C models is difficult due to the fact that many parameters are global parameters with poorly understood regional variations with climate, vegetation, and edaphic properties. Leveraging these additional datasets as benchmarks instead of systematically assimilating them to constrain global model parameters may be the best use of these observations. Relaxing the global parameter assumption could be another option
