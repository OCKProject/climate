<p id="Par6" class="p">In this work, we utilized a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to sample the parameter space for three different modeling frameworks in order to produce a calibrated ensemble of parameter values weighted by agreement with soil C observations. We chose three representative global soil C decomposition models with different structures (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), among which were conventional Century-type model, a vertically resolved soil C model with explicit soil depth embedded in CLM 4.5
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup> (CLM 4.5bgc) and a microbial model (the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization: MIMICS
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>). A set of projections driven by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) was carried out for all the three models with their posterior parameter ensembles to generate a distribution of predicted soil C, from which statistics such as the mean and uncertainty were estimated.
