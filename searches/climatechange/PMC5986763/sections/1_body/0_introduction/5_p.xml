<p id="Par7" class="p">We hypothesized that uncertainty in projected soil C change by varying parameter values can be substantial: specifically CLM 4.5 and MIMICS would have larger projection uncertainty than the conventional Century-type model, especially the microbial model which is nonlinear and has a larger parameter space than the other two models; the two non-microbial models would predict decrease in soil C in response to climate change, but the microbial model could predict either negative or positive responses depending on parameter values; the projected soil C content would be correlated with initial conditions in the two non-microbial models but not in the microbial model. We found that CLM 4.5 and MIMICS with data-driven parameter values projected much greater uncertainties in soil C responses to climate change than the conventional Century-type soil C model, with both positive and negative C-climate feedbacks.</p>
