 </sup>. Large uncertainty in the predictions of soil C has been well documented among these models. Several model inter-comparisons (e.g., CMIP

 </sup> and MsTMIP
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>) have demonstrated that global land C models vary considerably in their estimates of the global soil C stock for the contemporary period

 </sup> reported large differences in estimated contemporary global soil C stocks, ranging from 510 to 3040 Pg C projected by 11 Earth system models, and in projected change over 21st century ranging from a loss of 72 Pg C to a gain of 253 Pg C under the worst-case greenhouse gas emission scenario; Tian et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup> reported substantial differences in estimated contemporary global soil C stocks ranging from 425 Pg C to 2111 Pg C by ten terrestrial biosphere models in the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP).
