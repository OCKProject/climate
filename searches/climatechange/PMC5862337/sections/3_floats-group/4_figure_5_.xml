  <p class="p">A conceptual model of the first appearance of key alpine-river taxa along a gradient of reducing catchment glacier cover across the Northern Hemisphere. The lines denote expected changes in individual biomass along the glacial gradient. Information regarding bacteria, protists, fungi, algae, diatoms, microinvertebrates, macroinvertebrates, mammals, amphibians, and fish is synthesized to predict biofilm, invertebrate, and vertebrate responses to reducing glacier influence.</p>
