<p class="p">This article provides an overview of global-scale patterns of glacier retreat and effects on mountain-river hydrological and physicochemical environments. We then synthesize the existing knowledge of how different groups of freshwater taxa (biofilm, invertebrates, and vertebrates) respond to glacier retreat, predominantly with a Northern Hemisphere focus because this is where most of the relevant research has been undertaken. This knowledge is then integrated within a new conceptual framework that considers simultaneous responses of biota to shrinking glaciers as part of multitrophic river ecosystems. This new multitaxonomic response framework is used subsequently to explore the consequences for how whole-river food webs can be expected to respond to ongoing glacier retreat. Such an approach is required to inform alpine conservation strategies by providing a holistic food-web context for the multiple cold-environment endemic species that are found in glacier-fed rivers around the world (e.g., Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>, Giersch et al. 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). These often-rare species are potentially sensitive and vulnerable to climate change, and their successful conservation will require detailed consideration of their links within river assemblages. Because glacier-fed river systems will respond rapidly to climate change, any reassembly of food webs could help to identify structural and functional changes that could be monitored in running waters across other biogeographical regions (Woodward et al.
