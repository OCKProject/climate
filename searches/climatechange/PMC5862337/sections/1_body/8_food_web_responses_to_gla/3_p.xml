<p class="p">Parker and Huryn (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) constructed connectance food webs for an Arctic mountain river lacking glacier influence (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6</xref>), which provides an indication of the changes that can be expected following glacier loss. A spring-fed food web supported slightly lower connectance (0.165–0.188) and longer mean chain lengths (2.98–3.10; Parker and Huryn 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) than those documented in the study by Clitherow and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). They also encompassed on average a further 14.5 nodes and 62.5 links (Parker and Huryn 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Although an absolute comparison is affected by differences in sampling effort and taxonomy between the two studies, some general patterns can be deduced from this comparison. The Arctic food webs were influenced primarily by the addition of top predators, Dolly Varden trout (
 <italic class="italic">Salvelinus malma</italic>) and America dipper (
 <italic class="italic">Cinclus mexicanus</italic>), absent from the Austrian glacial food webs. In addition, Khamis and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) investigated the influence of increased macroinvertebrate predator abundance (
 <italic class="italic">Perla grandis</italic>) in spring-fed, 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> experimental mesocosm channels. Their results suggested that the future range expansion of this species (into streams that are currently highly glacial and therefore are unsuitable habitat) will increase trophic height (and therefore food-chain length) and body-size spectrums through invasion, intraguild predation, and interference competition (Khamis et al. 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
