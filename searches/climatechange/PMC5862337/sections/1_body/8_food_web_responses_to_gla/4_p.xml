<p class="p">As prolonged glacier retreat will lead to ice-melt-influenced river reaches becoming dominated by groundwaters, it could be expected that their food webs will adopt the structural characteristics of spring-fed community networks (Lavandier and Décamps 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>). On the basis of this concept, figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6</xref> illustrates predicted changes to connectance food-web metrics with reducing catchment glacier cover. Construction of alpine-river food webs along gradients of glacier influence, using standardized methods and analysis techniques, is required to test these predictions further. In their absence, research investigating food-web responses to increasing water temperatures may be drawn on to explain this structural reassembly. Warming increases cold-water productivity, and more nutrient-rich waters may reduce directed connectivity by abating the requirement for flexible, opportunistic feeding strategies and diminishing the omnivory and cannibalism adopted to survive on a limited food supply (Lavandier and Décamps

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>, Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Warmer waters will also reduce constraints on body mass and metabolic rates, hosting a greater abundance of larger individuals and supporting increased predator densities (Parker and Huryn 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Woodward et al. 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). This, together with the upstream migration of ectothermic species following the expanding range of a particular life-stage thermal optimum, will increase food-chain lengths and the number of nodes (species) and links (Lavandier and Décamps 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>, Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The spectra of body sizes will also increase, strengthening size structuring, which can promote web stability (Woodward 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
