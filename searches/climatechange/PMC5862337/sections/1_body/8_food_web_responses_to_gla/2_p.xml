<p class="p">In a detailed mountain-river food-web study, Clitherow and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) used gut-content analysis to produce connectance and trivariate food webs for the river within 100 meters of the Ödenwinkelkees glacier, Austrian Alps (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6</xref>). Food webs were characterized by the highest connectance values (0.05–0.19) obtained for running waters, primarily because of generalist, opportunistic, and omnivorous macroinvertebrate feeding strategies in response to low primary production (Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Mean chain lengths were very short (2–2.27) because large predators were absent, given the cold-water temperature constraints on body size (Ilg and Castella 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This diminished the size structuring usually prevalent within freshwaters (Woodward 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The webs supported few nodes and links, reflecting the low densities and biomass of taxa illustrated in figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>. Feeding links were predominantly between macroinvertebrates (Chironomidae, 
 <italic class="italic">Diamesa</italic>) and both epilithic diatoms and detritus (Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), as was noted in other studies (Zah et al. 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Füreder et al. 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Although unable to identify species-level connections, stable isotope analyses from other river systems have confirmed that the short mean chain lengths and low numbers of nodes and links in glacier-margin food webs result from macroinvertebrate feeding plasticity in response to an annually sustained autochthonous energy base (Fellman et al. 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Isotope methods can be particularly useful for detecting links not easily observed using gut-content approaches. For example, whereas Clitherow and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) inferred the importance of microbial subsidies of carbon and other nutrients in the Ödenwinkelkees food web, Fellman and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) were able to use 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C signatures to confirm that this was the case in other glacial rivers, where ancient carbon (hundreds of years old) released from the glacier was probably consumed by microbes and then assimilated by macroinvertebrates.
