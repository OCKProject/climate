<p class="p">Reducing glacier influence comprises more than an increase in river water temperature, with reducing suspended-sediment concentrations, discharge variability, and channel instability also influencing food-web structure (Parker and Huryn

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Parker and Huryn (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) found spring-fed rivers supporting these conditions to facilitate significantly increased bryophyte growth and persistence, in comparison with more unstable, dynamic channels. Bryophyte and epilithon communities provide structurally complex habitat refugia and food sources for macroinvertebrate larvae and meiofauna (Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Turbidity gradients also exert strong control on the density of bacteria (Peter and Sommaruga 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In turn, reduced disturbance regimes may provide a mechanism for increasing productivity, biomass, and species densities in mountain-river food webs, independently of mean water temperature.
