<p class="p">Glacier retreat may further influence food-web structure indirectly, acting beyond water-source alteration. Prolonged retreat and the subsequent extension of the ice-free period will reduce the seasonality of river ecosystems, ensuring that production and reproduction become less confined to a short summer phase (Malard et al. 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Durant et al. 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). This may increase energy availability to food webs, particularly through algal blooming, or uncouple the timing of consumer requirement from prey availability, reducing food-web links and potentially taxon survival (Durant et al. 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Significant ice loss could also lead to intermittency or cessation of flow (Ward et al. 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Periods of low or no flow could introduce trophic cascades of variable magnitude and may induce the compensatory reorganization of whole food-web cores, influencing all species within a community both directly and indirectly (Ledger et al. 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Lu et al. 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
