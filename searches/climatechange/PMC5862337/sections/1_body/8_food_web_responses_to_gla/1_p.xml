<p class="p">Although it is important to determine the responses of particular trophic groups to glacier retreat and climate change generally, constituent taxa will never be affected independently because of the diversity of feeding and competitive interactions. This means that extrapolating out to community or whole-ecosystem responses from population-level studies is likely to fail to capture the emergent properties that characterize complex ecological networks (Woodward et al. 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Our multitaxa response framework enables explorations of how whole mountain-river food webs will respond to deglaciation. Despite the significant contribution of network theory to freshwater science (Thompson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), still only a handful of food webs have been constructed for proglacial-river systems. Most researchers have employed stable isotope analysis to map energy flow through benthic communities (Zah et al. 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Fellman et al. 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), highlighting, for example, the importance of dissolved organic matter consumption by microbial groups supporting wider food webs. However, further comparison of food webs is required to compare different mountain water sources. More studies of species-level interactions using connectance food webs are crucial to the investigation of the direct and indirect cascades that will occur through entire river ecosystems with decreasing glacier influence (Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
