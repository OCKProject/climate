<p class="p">As environmental harshness declines with glacier retreat, there is expected to be a strong reduction in the influence of deterministic, abiotic control of community composition and subsequently a greater importance of stochastic and competition-driven assembly processes (Milner et al.

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). This effect has been noted for macroinvertebrates but may be altered with detailed consideration of assembly processes that consider interactions among multiple biological groups, many of which have been less well studied. Furthermore, the relative importance of biotic interactions and dispersal processes is still considered as a secondary effect in comparison with abiotic controls, despite recent observations of strong predation, omnivory, and cannibalism in glacially influenced rivers (Füreder et al.

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Reductions in ice-melt inputs are already driving the reassembly of aquatic ecosystems, because species colonization is mediated by the efficacy of physiological and behavioral adaptions to imposed conditions (Ilg and Castella

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). There is therefore a pressing need to develop an understanding of the importance of whole-ecosystem interactions in these reassembly processes.
