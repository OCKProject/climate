<p class="p">This literature synthesis has informed the development of a new conceptual framework that advances the widely accepted model of Milner and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) for macroinvertebrates (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5</xref>) to predict multitrophic responses to reducing glacier influence (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>). The first appearances of all biological groups considered in this synthesis are mapped simultaneously to a gradient of reducing catchment glacier cover. The purpose of this model is to inform holistic predictions of whole-alpine-river community reassembly and potential food-web restructuring in response to glacier retreat. It can thus serve as a focus for moving alpine-river science, conservation, and management beyond current paradigms that typically focus on single taxonomic groups.
