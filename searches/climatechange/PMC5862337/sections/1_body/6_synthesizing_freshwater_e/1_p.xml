<p class="p">Changes to alpine-river water sourcing driven by glacier retreat will clearly influence the processes of mountain-river ecosystem assembly for all trophic groups (Ilg and Castella

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The discrete physicochemical and flow-regime characteristics of ice melt, snowpack melt, and groundwater act as strong abiotic filters in proglacial rivers, enabling only species with traits and behaviors adapted to these particular conditions to persist (Milner et al.

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although the majority of studies focusing on community assembly in glacier-fed river systems have worked with macroinvertebrates (figure

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), evidence from other groups such as bacteria and protists also suggest a strong abiotic influence on assembly (Eisendle-Flöckner et al.

 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Species richness and density are reduced heavily in glacial rivers, but cold stenothermic species have adapted to persist within turbid conditions close to freezing (Wilhelm et al. 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Peter and Sommaruga 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In contrast, diatom and aquatic hyphomycetes communities are relatively unconstrained by harsh conditions (Gessner and Robinson
