<p class="p">This conceptual model is derived from the literature synthesis described above and therefore requires broader geographic validation and refinement to assess its general applicability, in a similar manner to which the model of Milner and Petts (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>) was revised by the coordinated European studies (AASER) described by Milner and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). At present, data are predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere, and although some studies demonstrate a global generality of macroinvertebrate responses to glacier retreat (e.g., Castella et al. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), species assemblages require adjustment to reflect glacier-fed river ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Cadbury et al. 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>, Cauvy-Fraunié et al. 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The model has a temporal focus toward data collected during summer months and therefore might not adequately capture the seasonal biomass and diversity fluctuations of specific taxa (e.g., macroinvertebrates and nondiatom algae). Protist, nematode, and rotifer components in particular need much more work than other groups, because fewer studies were available to detail their responses (Eisendle-Flöckner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Robertson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
