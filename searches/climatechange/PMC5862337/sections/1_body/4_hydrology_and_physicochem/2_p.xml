<p class="p">Mountain catchments are particularly vulnerable to climate change because glacier runoff significantly influences the source, rate, and timing of water directed to river networks (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>, Jansson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Subsequently, prolonged glacier retreat will add further spatiotemporal variability to water-source patterns. Reducing ice-melt inputs will increase the proportional contribution of snow melt, rain, and groundwater (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>), completely reworking the mosaic of channel environments present in glacier-fed river floodplains (Malard et al. 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and inducing significant reorganization of river biotic communities.
