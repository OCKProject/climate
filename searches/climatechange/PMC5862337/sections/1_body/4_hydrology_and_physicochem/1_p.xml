<p class="p">In addition to glacier ice melt, mountain rivers are supplied by runoff from snowpack ablation and groundwater. As was described by Brown and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>), these water sources have distinct physicochemical compositions and discharge patterns. River reaches dominated by ice melt have significantly lower mean water temperatures, electrical conductivity, and channel stability and higher suspended-sediment concentrations and greater discharge fluctuations than groundwater reaches (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3</xref>). Ice-melt inputs reduce and groundwater influence increases with downstream distance from glacier margins, reflecting reducing catchment glacier cover (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Temporal variability within water-source contributions is sustained by diel and seasonal ice-melt cycles, interannual alteration to snowpack accumulation, and intense storm events (Milner et al.
