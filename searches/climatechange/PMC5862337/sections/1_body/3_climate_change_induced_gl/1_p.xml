<p class="p">Arctic and alpine zones are experiencing pervasive increases in near-surface temperatures and altered patterns of precipitation (Gobiet et al. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), leading to the thinning and retreat of many glaciers (IPCC 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The magnitude of these changes is amplified within alpine regions as decreases in snow accumulation, earlier spring melt, and prolonged summer ice melt are altering surface albedo and lengthening the melt season. This increases energy absorption and sustains negative glacier mass balances (Gobiet et al. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). These positive feedback mechanisms are accelerating alpine glacier shrinkage in many regions (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2</xref>; Zemp et al. 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). For large glaciers and ice sheets, such as those in parts of Iceland and Greenland, this ice melt will initially increase river discharge, scouring and exposing new channels as their margins recede, whereas smaller glaciers will see consistent reductions in runoff and eventually complete loss (Gobiet et al. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
