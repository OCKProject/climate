<p class="p">Fish are often absent from highly glacial rivers, in which low water temperature constrains growth rates or fails to meet the optima required for particular life-cycle stages (Fleming 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Waterfalls and steep channel gradients may also limit their dispersal within mountain rivers. For many species, spawning is constrained in braided channel systems because of high suspended-sediment concentrations and an absence of stable pool environments (Milner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Despite this, large glacier-river systems in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains are able to support salmonid populations, because ice melt increases summer flow rates relative to clear-water tributaries, facilitating upstream migration and elevating nutrient and oxygen availability (figure

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). These systems also host slow-flowing side channels and pools suitable for rearing and juvenile overwintering, where high suspended-sediment conditions provide cover from aerial predators (Milner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Arctic charr (
