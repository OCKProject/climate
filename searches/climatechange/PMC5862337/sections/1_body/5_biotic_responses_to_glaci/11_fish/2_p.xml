<p class="p">A reduction of glacier ice melt could limit channel discharge, restricting salmonid migration and disconnecting channel marginal habitats. However, flow compensation from snow melt and groundwater sources could maintain high, less turbid discharge, aiding migration and spawning (Fleming

 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) found salmonids were able to rapidly recolonize proglacial channels within 10 years of their exposure from ice cover. This dispersal may be limited by anthropogenic barriers, including hydroelectric dams (Hari et al. 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Biological constraints include the comparatively reduced oxygen concentrations of warmer waters, novel predation pressures as communities reassemble, and the potential increase of temperature-dependent disease (Hari et al. 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Periods of high-velocity flow following intense ice-melt periods could act as physical barriers to fish dispersal within alpine streams (Sinnatamby et al.
