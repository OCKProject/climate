<p class="p">Salamandridae encompasses a number of amphibious species that rely on European mountain rivers. The common fire salamander (
 <italic class="italic">Salamandra salamandra</italic>) and alpine newt (
 <italic class="italic">Ichthyosaura alpestris</italic>) favor zones of reduced glacier influence, including alpine woodland rivers below 2500 meters (Kuzmin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>, Arntzen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In contrast, the Pyrenean brook newt (
 <italic class="italic">Calotriton asper</italic>) requires fast-flowing, highly oxygenated, cobbled river reaches for larval development (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>; Comas and Ribas 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The common frog (
 <italic class="italic">Rana temporaria</italic>) persists within mountain woodlands and meadows below 2300 meters, using rivers and lakes for larval development and overwintering in open water to avoid freezing conditions (Ludwig et al. 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Glacier retreat may alter the behavior of these species (e.g., abandonment of freeze-avoidance strategies) but not their persistence, because they also inhabit many nonglaciated mountain catchments (Ludwig et al. 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Glacier retreat therefore has the potential to create much more suitable river environments, aiding the spread of these large-bodied aquatic predators.
