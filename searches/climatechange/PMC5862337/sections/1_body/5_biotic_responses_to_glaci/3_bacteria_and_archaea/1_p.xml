<p class="p">Genetically diverse bacterial communities persist within alpine rivers, with Cyanobacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Homeothrix, Clastidium</italic>) dominating biofilm formation (Kawecka et al. 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1971</xref>, Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Rott et al. 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Highly glacial rivers support 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actionobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Nitrospira</italic> (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>), with species that adhere to subglacial ice surfaces also contributing to river community composition following spring basal floods (Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Wilhelm et al. 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Archaea also inhabit glacier ice, entering stream biofilm communities during intensive melting events and reducing in density with increasing distance from the glacier terminus (Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). Although reducing glacier influence increases bacterial biomass, Wilhelm and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) noted reductions in bacterial alpha and beta diversity as cold stenothermic species were replaced by generalist taxa (Freimann et al. 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, this remains contested given that Battin and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found alpha diversity to increase as ice melt exposed rock and soil habitats, which provide a greater diversity of microbe sources.
