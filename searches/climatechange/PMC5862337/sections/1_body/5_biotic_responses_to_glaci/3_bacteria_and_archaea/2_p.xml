<p class="p">Glacial rivers are dominated by bacterial specialists, with groundwater species expressing greater metabolic redundancy and environmental plasticity (Freimann et al. 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This gradient of specialization is correlated with suspended sediment concentration and highly glacial sites host taxa adapted to reduced light penetration and greater abrasion (Peter and Sommaruga 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Glacier-margin habitats are also susceptible to spring-melt flood pulses, which constrain bacterial cell density through scouring, sheer stress, and fine-sediment abrasion of biofilm architecture (Blenkinsopp and Lock 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>). Reducing glacier influence may diminish this habitat heterogeneity, favoring a more generalist bacterial community (Freimann et al. 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Response to catchment-scale variability in electrical conductivity and pH can further influence local species dominance (Wilhelm et al. 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
