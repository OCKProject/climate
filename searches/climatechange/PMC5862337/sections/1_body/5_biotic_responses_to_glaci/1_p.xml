<p class="p">Mountain-river ecosystems host a diverse range of taxa, which play varied trophic roles. Primary producers include bacteria, soft-bodied algae, and diatoms, whereas other bacteria, fungi, and protists play important roles as microbial decomposers and consumers of particulate and dissolved organic matter (Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Benthic rotifers feed on primary producers (bacteria and algae) and detritus alongside protozoans (Schmid-Araya 2000). Free-living nematodes also consume these groups, with some species predating rotifers and other meiofauna (Schmid-Araya 2000). Multiple trophic roles are also spanned by macroinvertebrates, with herbivores (grazers and scrapers) feeding on biofilm species, detritivorous shredders, collectors, and filter feeders consuming dead organic matter and predators selecting adult and larval invertebrates (Woodward

Fish, primarily salmonids, are often the top predator of glacier-fed river systems, and although diet is species, life stage, and region specific, components include smaller fish, macroinvertebrates, and freshwater zooplankton (Sinnatamby et al. 
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Some fish species also feed on the eggs of amphibians, which can be insectivorous or predatory (Arntzen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>, Kuzmin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Where present, semiaquatic mammals such as desman species (Talpidae) predate many trophic levels with diets spanning macrophytes, insects, fish, and amphibians (Biffi et al. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
