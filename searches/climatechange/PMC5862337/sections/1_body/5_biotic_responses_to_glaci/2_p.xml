<p class="p">The diverse range of taxa within mountain rivers will respond simultaneously to water-source alterations imposed by glacier retreat (e.g., Brown and Milner

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). It is important to review contemporary knowledge of these responses before attempting to understand holistically the reshaping of glacier-river ecosystems during deglaciation. Disparate literature considering biofilm, invertebrates, and vertebrates is collated here because despite a recent proliferation of studies considering particular trophic groups of alpine-river ecosystems, they are rarely considered collectively. Particular focus is given to less- studied groups that contribute to community response and encompass a broad range of endemism, rarity, and vulnerability to climate change.
