<p class="p">The influence of glacier retreat on protists remains poorly understood (Rott et al. 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Eisendle-Fl√∂ckner and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found a 35% reduction in catchment ice coverage in the Austrian Alps to double algal (minus diatom) abundance and increase protist abundance threefold, suggesting a stronger relationship with deglaciation than for other biofilm taxa. However, the absence of species-level identification and comparative studies hinders a more detailed analysis of this response. Low protist abundance where glacier influence is high (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>) may result from predation by meiofaunal invertebrates (Hakenkamp and Morin 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>), which can remain relatively abundant within cold conditions. Some protists can reach sizes that justify classification as meiofauna, and their preferential grazing of benthic bacteria and algae (Hakenkamp and Morin 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>) may limit the density of these taxa at less glacial sites.
