<p class="p">The relationship between alpine water sources and the macroinvertebrate component of river communities is well documented (Milner and Petts 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>, Castella et al. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Jacobsen et al.

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Strong responses of macroinvertebrate alpha and beta diversity to glacier retreat have been linked to changes in water temperature and channel stability in many studies (Milner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>, Finn et al. 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Milner and Petts (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>) and then Milner and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) developed a conceptual model to include water temperature and channel stability as critical drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblage in glacially influenced rivers. This illustrated the reorganization of macroinvertebrate communities in response to reducing glacial influence (Milner and Petts 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>), embodying the individualistic concept (Gleason 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1926</xref>) by attributing ecological communities to particular positions along natural gradients in response to their tolerances.
