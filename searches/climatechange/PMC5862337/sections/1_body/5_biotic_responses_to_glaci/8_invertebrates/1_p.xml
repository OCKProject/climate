<p class="p">Although understanding of microinvertebrates (e.g., nematodes and rotifers) remains limited in comparison with that of macroinvertebrates (Thorp and Rogers 
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), Eisendle-Flöckner and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) studied these groups in detail across the Möll catchment, Austrian Alps, where they dominated the invertebrate community. Taxonomic richness increased with decreasing glacier influence, but density and abundance did not do so consistently, showing limited seasonal variability. This relationship requires further investigation, but elevated biomass despite harsh environmental conditions may be explained by the resilience traits of these pioneer taxa (Eisendle‐Flöckner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, Robertson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). At highly glacial sites, nematodes were more diverse but less abundant than rotifers (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>), and their maturity was constrained, suggesting a strong negative relationship with glacial influence (Eisendle‐Flöckner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Despite this, some meiofauna may be resilient to the high flows associated with large glaciers yet to reach peak retreat rates, because although Robertson and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) identified meiofaunal taxonomic abundance and richness to decline following an extreme rainfall event, they returned to preflood values for some rivers within 2 years. Protozoan responses to glacier retreat should be coupled with meiofaunal responses, because they feed on rotifers and are consumed by nematodes and microinvertebrates (Schmid-Araya 2000).
