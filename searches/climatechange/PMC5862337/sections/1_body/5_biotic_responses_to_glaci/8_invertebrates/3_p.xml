<p class="p">Milner and colleagues’ (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) revised model used information from the Arctic and Alpine Stream Ecosystem Research Program (AASER; figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5</xref>). This conceptual synthesis incorporated information from a large number of European study sites and accounted for serial discontinuities by removing reliance on previous assumptions that confined low water temperature and channel stability to close glacial proximity (Milner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Milner 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Jacobsen and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) also identified temporal shifts in the distribution of glacier influence, with diurnal flood pulses altering downstream physicochemistry gradients and leading to the subsequent reorganization of macroinvertebrate communities. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5</xref> highlights the first occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">Diamesa</italic> in highly glacial sites and an increase in other macroinvertebrate groups—and therefore taxonomic richness, density, and biomass—with reducing glacier influence. Castella and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) demonstrated the pervasiveness of this pattern across Europe, identifying links between macroinvertebrate community structure, substrate stability, and water temperature in glacial rivers within five biogeographical regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Cadbury and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) later refined this model for Southern Hemisphere species, using data collected in alpine New Zealand (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">5</xref>). Despite increases in macroinvertebrate richness and biomass, glacier retreat is reducing the beta and gamma diversity of alpine rivers globally (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>, Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, Finn et al. 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This is driven by the extirpation of cold stenothermic species dependent on the physicochemical environment provided by ice-melt inputs (Giersch et al. 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This conceptual model has proven remarkably successful in explaining macroinvertebrate community structure patterns in many glacier-fed river environments (Milner 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). It therefore has significant potential for being developed more widely to incorporate other taxonomic groups, something that to date has not been attempted.
