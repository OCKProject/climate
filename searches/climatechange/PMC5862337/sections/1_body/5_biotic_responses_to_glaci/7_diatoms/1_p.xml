<p class="p">Unlike other algae, diatom species richness remains high until within very close proximity to glacier margins, and they form the principal food source of cold-adapted macroinvertebrates (Rott et al. 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). As was shown by Gesierich and Rott (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Hannaea arcus, Achnanthes</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Diatoma</italic> spp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Fragilaria</italic> spp. consistently dominate glacial sites across Europe, North America, and the Himalayas (figure

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>, Rott et al. 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). These pioneer species are small and nonmobile and resist abrasion in turbid glacial rivers through strong adhesion to substrates at the benthic interface (Hieber et al. 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Gesierich and Rott 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Antoniades and Douglas (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) identified the specialist adaptions of 
 <italic class="italic">H. arcus</italic> to cold waters and subsequent intolerance of groundwater. In contrast, species including 
 <italic class="italic">Diatoma mesodon</italic> demonstrate greater environmental plasticity, occurring within subalpine and lower altitude rivers. Total diatom biomass increases as ice-melt inputs are reduced, but this proliferation may be constrained by herbivory, because grazing macroinvertebrates are more abundant within warmer, more stable rivers (Milner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The strong attachment capability of small epilithic diatoms may limit their consumption at glacial sites, increasing densities relative to other biofilm taxa (Gesierich and Rott 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
