<p class="p">Aquatic hyphomycetes dominate alpine-river fungal communities and are the principal microbial decomposers of allochthonous organic-matter inputs (Gessner and Robinson 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Specialist species are relatively unconstrained by cold temperatures and high suspended-sediment concentrations, with fungal biomass, taxonomic richness, sporulation rate, and diversity at glacial sites reduced but comparable to those of temperate rivers (Gessner and Robinson 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Decomposition rates are reduced 20%â€“60% at temperatures approaching 0 degrees Celsius, but it has been argued that this stems from a limited supply of organic matter rather than from physicochemical constraints on metabolism (Robinson et al. 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>). Reduced glacier influence may alter species dominance within fungal communities favoring those adapted to warmer waters, although this response will be mediated by local factors including nutrient supply and disturbance regime (Battin et al. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
