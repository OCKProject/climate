Although extensive catchment glaciation dramatically reduces algal species richness, density, and diversity, cold stenotherms adapt to variability in flow and nutrient pulses through alterations to cell physiology, life-cycle length, and preferential use of stable microhabitats (Kawecka et al.

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Sessile algae are influenced by seasonal variability in light availability, disturbance, and temperature (Kawecka 1971). Hieber and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) described the resulting proliferation of algal growth and chlorophyll production during spring and autumn: times of reduced suspended-sediment concentrations, increased solar radiation, and nutrient influx from snowpack melt. These blooms overlay a general increase in algal biomass with reducing glacier influence, a trend driven in part by groundwater blooms extending through summer (Lavandier and DÃ©camps
