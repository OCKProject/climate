<p class="p">Despite the need for further validation, our new conceptual framework offers immediate potential to inform conservation management strategies by highlighting that cold stenothermic species are found beyond the macroinvertebrate component of river communities (e.g., algae, diatoms, and vertebrates) and that other taxonomic groups can serve as differential indicators of climate change in mountain-river systems. It also holds value beyond alpine rivers because the reorganization of communities within glaciated headwaters will intrinsically influence the species pools available to colonize downstream reaches, potentially reshaping their assembly processes (Brown and Milner

The often-strong deterministic effects of habitat on alpine-river biological communities mean that they are valuable model systems for understanding ecosystem responses to environmental change. Coupled with the potential for species interactions to be investigated and manipulated easily and comprehensively (e.g., Khamis et al.

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), glacier-fed rivers offer significant potential to inform mechanistic predictions in other river systems that will be modified by environmental change.
