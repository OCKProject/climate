<p class="p">This synthesis article has presented a novel conceptual framework that collates the simultaneous responses of multitrophic river ecosystems to glacier retreat (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>). Knowledge of biofilm, invertebrate, and vertebrate responses from individual studies can inform holistic predictions of the rapid reshaping of mountain-river ecosystems in response to climate change. Although the responses of certain taxa remain poorly resolved, general predictions from the best-studied groups can nevertheless guide understanding of food-web responses to deglaciation. Glacial reaches are expected to shift over time to develop the structural characteristics of contemporary rain- and groundwater-fed food webs (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">6</xref>). Increases in mean water temperature and channel stability will drive reduced directed connectance and increased mean chain lengths, predator densities, energy availability, size structuring, and the relative contribution of biotic (particularly competition) influences on community assembly (Parker and Huryn

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Mean numbers of nodes and links may initially increase as more and larger generalist species proliferate, broadening the spectrum of body sizes (Friberg et al. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, the potential extinction of some cold specialist species due to novel predation pressure and habitat reduction may constrain these metrics (Hari et al.

 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>, Giersch et al. 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Ice melt could induce further structural reorganization as reduced seasonality, periodic drought, and potential flow cessation alter energy-production rates and network stability (Durant et al. 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>, Lu et al. 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The scientific community places “high confidence” in the accelerating and pervasive nature of worldwide glacial shrinkage (IPCC 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>, p. 4). The associated threats to mountain-river biodiversity (Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) highlight the urgent need for an improved understanding of these predicted responses.
