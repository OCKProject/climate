<p class="p">Future research should investigate protist, nematode, rotifer, virus, and protozoa communities in much more detail, given that less is known regarding the response of these groups to glacier retreat and especially their role within food webs, which often reveal vertebrate–macroinvertebrate–algal links. Protist species should receive particular focus because their densities appear to be more sensitive to deglaciation than those of other freshwater taxa (Eisendle‐Flöckner et al. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Species whose density and richness are influenced minimally by glacial conditions (e.g., aquatic hyphomycetes, diatoms, and rotifers) should be highlighted as potential conservation priorities, because intensive specialization may increase their vulnerability to water-source alterations (Wrona et al. 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Comparative studies are required to determine food-web structure both at the extremes of glacier influence and along a quantified spectrum of intermediary stages to investigate the ecosystem-level effects of glacier retreat (Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). There is also requirement for more winter sampling (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) to determine the influence of seasonal variability in biomass (macroinvertebrate, nondiatom algae) on ecosystem structure and food-web dynamics.
