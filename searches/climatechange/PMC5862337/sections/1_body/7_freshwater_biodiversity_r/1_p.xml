<p class="p">From the multitrophic synthesis of population responses to glacier retreat, a number of general trends can be hypothesized that transcend most taxa. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref> suggests both an increase in the biomass of most groups with reducing glacier influence, as well as a shift toward the introduction of more large-bodied predators (invertebrates, mammals, and amphibians) as glacier cover declines. This whole-food-web response is likely to underpin the decreasing part of the unimodal response of macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and density at low glacier cover (Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although macroinvertebrate alpha diversity has been shown to peak at intermediate stages of glacier influence (Jacobsen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), our synthesis suggests this response might not be generalizable to other groups. Vertebrates, for example, provide an exception to these trends, because desman species (
 <italic class="italic">G. pyrenaicus</italic>) and the Pyrenean brook newt (
 <italic class="italic">C. asper</italic>) preferentially occupy high-velocity mountain rivers in the Pyrénées, increasing their density and in turn biomass with reducing glacier influence (Comas and Ribas 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>, Biffi et al. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Notably, they appear first at intermediate levels of glacier catchment cover (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>), in contrast to ubiquitous macroinvertebrates. They then continue to benefit from their improved habitat conditions, few if any larger predators, and abundant food sources as glaciers are lost.
