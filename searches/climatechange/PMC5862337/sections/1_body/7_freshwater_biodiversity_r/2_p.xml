<p class="p">For some biofilm groups (bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, and protists) and meiofauna (rotifers and nematodes), the relationship between taxonomic richness and reducing glacier influence appears to be linear, resulting in increases in biomass with glacier retreat (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>). However, a relative lack of research focusing on the biomass of these groups along comprehensive gradients of glacier influence may mask a unimodal response as this linear trend is adjusted for groups including diatoms and protists (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>). Here, densities are relatively suppressed by intensified grazing pressures as meiofauna and macroinvertebrate densities increase (Hakenkamp and Morin 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>, Gesierich and Rott 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The additive influence of these varied, multiple taxa group responses needs to be explored in more detail, but the cumulative effect can be hypothesized as an increase in community biomass in response to glacier retreat, reaching some form of asymptote at low or no glacier cover. However, the presence of subsidies from terrestrial systems may alter the nature of the total biomass response, especially at low or no glacier cover, or in locations such as southeast Alaska and New Zealand, where glaciers often terminate in close proximity to forests.
