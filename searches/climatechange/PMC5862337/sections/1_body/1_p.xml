<p class="p">Most ecological research within proglacial-river systems has focused predominantly on populations or communities of specific taxonomic groups, particularly macroinvertebrates (figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">1</xref>). To move forward our understanding of how climate change and glacier retreat are reshaping whole aquatic ecosystems, there is a need to develop an integrated understanding spanning multiple taxonomic groups and trophic levels in glacier-fed rivers (e.g., bacteria, protists, fungi, algae, diatoms, invertebrates, mammals, amphibians, and fish; Clitherow et al. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Individual- to population-level responses cannot always be extrapolated easily to predict links at a network level, given that emergent properties are characteristic of complex systems (Woodward et al. 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). One means of integrating the interactions among species that are responding in unison to environmental change is within the context of food-web ecology.
