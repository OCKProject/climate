<p id="Par43" class="p">Potential malaria transmission stability is increased in areas where the climatic changes favor vector occurrences as well as significantly impact the vectorial capacity. As a result, vector stability shows the highest increases between historical and future periods for the southern and south-eastern European areas. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles atroparvus</italic>, the dominant vector in large parts of Europe, might play an important role with respect to changes of the potential transmission stability. Risk assessments of malaria in view of climate change as well as of other factors like land use changes and ongoing urbanization are of particular importance on the local scale. The present contribution adds to the current research by providing high-resolution projections of climate-induced changes in Europe and the Mediterranean area.
