<p id="Par39" class="p">The present study highlights that distinct changes in the distributions of the dominant vectors of human malaria are to be expected under the constraints of future climate change. Temperature and precipitation changes will lead to a northward spread of the occurrences of 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> vectors. This result is in general agreement with the findings from the global-scale, multi-model malaria assessment of Caminade et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, RCMs provide more detailed spatial patterns compared to GCMs, which allows for an improved analysis of the relationships of vector distribution and transmission stability with climatic changes. Thus, the high-resolution projections of the present study showed that for some Mediterranean areas occurrence probabilities may decline, mainly due to projected rainfall decreases.
