<p id="Par40" class="p">Furthermore, the modelled expansions of vector distributions in the future do not automatically imply a concurrent increase of the potential malaria transmission stability. Transmission stability was only increased in areas where the climatic changes favor vector occurrences as well as yield enough temperature rise to significantly impact the vectorial capacity. As a consequence of this, the VSI showed the highest increases between historical and future periods for the southern and south-eastern European areas. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles atroparvus</italic> is the dominant vector in large parts of Europe under present as well as future climate conditions. In addition, it has the highest human-biting proportion and daily survival rate of the European vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. The increases of the duration of the transmission season and of the extrinsic incubation period assigns this vector an important role with respect to changes of the potential transmission stability. Countries affected by an increased malaria risk comprised for instance Spain, southern France, Italy, Greece, the eastern European countries Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia and Serbia as well as southern Ukraine and Russia (Fig.
