<p id="Par41" class="p">This study is one of the first high-resolution assessment of the impact of future climate change on vector distributions and potential transmission stability in the European and Mediterranean area using state-of-the-art climate scenarios. Further improvements may be possible through the consideration of a more diverse influence of temperature on the transmission intensity of malaria. For instance, Shapiro et al. [

 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> that there are complex relationships of temperature with adult mosquito longevity, human-biting rate, the developmental period of the parasite within the mosquito, and the proportion of mosquitoes that become infectious. Paajmans et al. [

 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> is modified by including the diurnal temperature range and day length in comparison to estimates based on mean temperature values only. While there is a high climate model agreement with respect to mean temperature and precipitation changes, the use of extremes and further explanatory variables, like e.g. wind speed or evapotranspiration will require a careful evaluation of the projection uncertainties related to these variables. Appropriate downscaling techniques have to be applied in this context, which involves the availability of reliable observational data as reference as well as specific methods, which preserve the physical consistency between variables and adequately adjust the extreme parts of the distributions [
