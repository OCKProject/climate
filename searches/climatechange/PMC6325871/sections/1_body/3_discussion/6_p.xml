<p id="Par42" class="p">Furthermore, important non-climatic factors such as population growth and urbanization, migration changes, and economic development should be considered for future risk assessments. Malaria declined rapidly in Europe during the 20th century due to the implementation of national elimination programs, involving for instance draining of wetlands, insecticide spraying, and improvements of health infrastructures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Yet a high number of imported malaria cases from endemic to non-endemic countries is reported, e.g. 2169 cases per year in the period 2005â€“2015 for France, 637 cases for Italy, 374 cases for Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. In addition, the local reappearance of malaria in some parts of southern Europe is observed in recent years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Migration and economic hardship are considered as critical variables with respect to the vulnerability of a region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Moreover, with respect to ongoing urbanization, novel breeding sites become available. For instance, special attention has recently been given to 
 <italic class="italic">An. plumbeus</italic>, which exploits man-made breeding sites, is able to transmit 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic>, and has a high human-biting proportion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Thus, further investigations should also consider this vector. In addition, very high-resolution climate and land-use modeling, which resolves the sub-urban scale, should be used for risk assessment.
