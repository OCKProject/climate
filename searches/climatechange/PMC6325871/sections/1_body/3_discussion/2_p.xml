<p id="Par38" class="p">Despite the finding that climatic predictors perform much better in the BRTs compared to land use information, it should be investigated how future land use changes may change vector occurrences. In the past, drainage of wetlands and new farming techniques substantially contributed to the eradication of malaria in Europe [

 <italic class="italic">An. labranchiae</italic> occurrences were found to be positively related to cropland, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">An. labranchiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. superpictus</italic> occurrences were negatively related to shrubland. It remains to be investigated how dynamic land use changes will alter the vector distributions in the future. A promising approach represents the Flagship Pilot Study “LUCAS” (Land Use &amp; Climate Across Scales) for Europe, as a EURO-CORDEX &amp; LUCID initiative, giving the prospect to consider consistently land use and climate changes in future studies of vector distribution.
