<p id="Par25" class="p">where m is month; i is vector; a is the human-biting proportion (0−1); p is the daily survival rate (0−1); and E is the length of extrinsic incubation period in days (for 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> E = 105/T-14.5). VSI was calculated for each vector i. The parameters a and p for each 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> species were taken from the publication of Kiszewski et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Within the calculation of the length of extrinsic incubation period E, mean temperature (T) of the historical time slice 1985–2005 as well as of the future time slices 2040–2060 and 2080–2100, taken from the bias-corrected RCM data, were used. The vector-specific VSI results were integrated into an overall information by multiplying the VSI value with the modelled occurrence probability for each vector at each grid box. The VSI of that vector which has the highest value of combined VSI and occurrence probability at a particular grid box was subsequently mapped.
