<p id="Par22" class="p">The modeling of the vector distributions using BRT requires both presence and absence data. The lack of confirmed absences in the occurrence data was addressed by the production of artificial absence data, called pseudo-absences. The pseudo-absences are all grid boxes outside of the suitable area, which is estimated by a rectilinear surface range envelope [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Following the recommendation of Barbet-Massin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] the same number of pseudo-absences as presences was tested (ratio 1:1, with 1000 presences and 1000 pseudo-absences randomly selected from the available data). Additionally, ratios of 5:1 (5000 pseudo-absences and 1000 presences) and 10:1 (5000 pseudo-absences and 500 presences) were also tested, since Sinka et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], although using different predictor data and BRT setup, found the best overall performance for the European and Middle Eastern 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> species with a ratio of 10:1 pseudo-absences to presence. Model validation was subsequently done using the remaining independent data not used for model building. The BRT model was used to predict vector occurrences to the independent data and the result was taken for evaluation of the model. As statistics on predictive performance deviance, correlation, discrimination and Kappa were estimated and results were also evaluated visually. Details on cross-validation and performance measures can be found for instance in [
