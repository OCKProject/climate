<p id="Par20" class="p">The performance of QM was assessed by using a split-sampling validation approach. For KNMI-RACMO22E the historical model output comprises the years 1950–2005, which was split into the 30-year calibration periods 1950–1979 and 1976–2005. Bias correction was done for each of the two calibration periods and the performance was validated in the two, from the correction independent, 26-year periods 1980–2005 and 1950–1975, respectively. For CLMcom-CCLM4-8-17 historical model output was available for the period 1960–2005 and the 25-year calibration periods 1960–1984 and 1981–2005 were used for setting up the transfer functions between observed and modelled values. The statistical bias correction was subsequently validated in the independent 21-year periods 1985–2005 and 1960–1980, respectively. Root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and modelled values was used as performance measure. RMSE is calculated for the arithmetic means across all grid cells, assuming an equal weight for each cell. Thus, it serves as a cumulative measure of the bias over the considered domain.</p>
