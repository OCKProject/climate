<p id="Par14" class="p">Mean, minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation data were taken from the daily 0.25° E-OBS dataset version 17 provided by the European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset (ECA&amp;D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]). A European-Mediterranean domain was selected, covering 75.375–25.375°N and 19.875°W49.875°E. Data in the time period 1950–2009 were selected. The time period 1985–2009, which is mainly used for subsequent analysis, was filtered for missing values for each month separately. A particular month was considered complete if there were less than three missing days per month, and the time series was considered complete if there were less than four missing months in the period 1985–2009. Grid boxes which did not meet these conditions were removed. Monthly temperature means (in Kelvin K) as well as monthly precipitation totals were calculated from the daily data.
