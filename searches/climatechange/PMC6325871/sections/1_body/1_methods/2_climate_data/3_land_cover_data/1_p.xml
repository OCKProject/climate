<p id="Par16" class="p">Land cover information was used in the form of 22 categories of land cover from the GlobCover project [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. GlobCover3 2009 V.2.3 land cover map is derived by an automatic and regionally-tuned classification of a time series of global ERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Instrument) Fine Resolution mosaics for the year 2009. The land cover classes, defined with the United Nations Land Cover Classification System, have a 300 × 300 m resolution. To match the E-OBS grid resolution, land cover information was calculated as percent coverage of each class in a particular 0.25° grid box.
