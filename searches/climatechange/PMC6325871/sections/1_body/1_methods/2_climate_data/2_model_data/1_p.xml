 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]) are employed. In the present study data with the grid resolution of about 50 km (0.44° on a rotated grid) are considered and conservatively regridded to 0.25° in order to match the E-OBS grid resolution. KNMI-RACMO22E driven by the GCM EC-EARTH as well as CLMcom-CCLM4-8-17 driven by MPI-ESM-LR were chosen as RCM simulations. The two RCMs were selected according to their good performance over Europe in the observational period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Historical runs for the period 1950–2005 (KNMI-RACMO22E) and 1960–2005 (CLMcom-CCLM4-8-17) as well as scenario runs for the period 2006–2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario assumptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] were available for subsequent analyses.
