<p id="Par33" class="p">Most noticeable is the northward spread of the vectors 
 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. messeae</italic> until the end of the 21st century, with concurrent disappearance of 
 <italic class="italic">An. messeae</italic> over the western parts of Europe. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles labranchiae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. sacherovi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. superpictus</italic> also showed northward extensions, but often with lower occurrence probabilities in the newly emerging areas. In contrast, vector occurrences in the Mediterranean area were generally mostly declining. Most pronounced was the reduction of the occurrence area of 
 <italic class="italic">An. superpictus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. sacharovi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. sergentii</italic> over the eastern Mediterranean area and North Africa under future climate conditions.
