<p id="Par35" class="p">Potential malaria transmission stability during the 21st century was assessed based on the VSI. The spatial index includes the most important intrinsic properties of anopheline mosquito vectors of malaria that interact with climate to determine vectorial capacity. The index examines potential transmission stability, and thus the index includes “anophelism (with as well as) without malaria” [
