RCM ensemble mean temperatures were used as climate data input for the calculation of the length of the extrinsic incubation period. Under historical climate conditions, there was in general a low force of transmission throughout Europe. Under RCP.8.5 conditions, large parts of the southern and south-eastern European area emerged as regions with a relatively high stability of potential malaria transmission. From the belt of high VSI values southwards towards North Africa as well as northwards towards Scandinavia, transmission stability declined. The decrease of malaria transmission stability to the south was mainly related to the projected rainfall reductions and the resulting decline of vector occurrences due to the drought-induced inhibition of the aquatic life-cycle of the vectors 
 <italic class="italic">An. sergentii</italic> and also partly 
 <italic class="italic">An. labranchiae</italic>. In contrast, the general northward decline from the belt of high stability points to the limitation of malaria transmission by temperature. The values of the VSI in central and northern Europe are controlled primarily by 
 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic>, in northern Scandinavia by 
 <italic class="italic">An. messeae</italic>. The temperature increases until the end of the 21st century suffice to have the vectors spread throughout Europe. However, the climatic changes only impacted the transmission stability in southern and south-eastern Europe, whereas the length of the extrinsic incubation period was still temperature-limited over northern Europe.
