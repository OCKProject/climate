<p id="Par27" class="p">Correction of the RCM data using empirical quantile mapping reduced the bias of KNMI-RACMO22E precipitation by 0.17 mm/day to a bias, averaged across all months, of 0.43 mm/day. For temperature, the bias was reduced by 1.35 K to an average bias of 1.14 K for mean temperature, by 1.62 K to 1.2 K for minimum temperature, and by 1.66 K to 1.14 K for maximum temperature. The bias of CLMcom-CCLM4-8-17 precipitation was0.38 mm/day lower compared to the raw RCM output and amounted after bias correction to 0.47 mm/day averaged over all months. Mean temperature bias was reduced by 0.62 K to 0.8 K, minimum temperature by 0.52 K to 0.84 K, and maximum temperature by 1.56 K to 0.87 K. The individual monthly values for all variables of both RCMs are tabulated in Additional file
