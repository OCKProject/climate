 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic> the most important temperature predictors (relative importance &gt; 5%) were temperature conditions in early spring. The fitted functions revealed that the 0 °C threshold is of particular importance in this regard. A similar relationship emerged for

 <italic class="italic">sacharovi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">superpictus</italic>, maximum temperatures in early spring up to approx. 10–15 °C were positively related to occurrence. For 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">messeae</italic>, mean temperature in spring was selected in the BRTs. These results point to the relevance of temperature conditions at the end of the hibernation period/beginning of the active period. For 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">superpictus</italic>, high maximum temperatures in autumn were favorable as well. For 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">messeae</italic>, an optimum maximum temperature range in autumn at the beginning of the hibernation period was also relevant. Overall, vector occurrences showed the highest dependence on temperature conditions in the transitional seasons at the beginning/end of the active and hibernation periods.
