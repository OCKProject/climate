 <italic class="italic">labranchiae</italic> precipitation in spring and early autumn played an important role. 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles sacharovi</italic> showed a great dependence on climate conditions (minimum and mean temperature, rainfall) in summer, the peak time of the adult activity. The occurrence of the North African species 
 <italic class="italic">An. sergentii</italic> was almost completely governed by rainfall conditions in summer. While in general precipitation was positively connected with 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> occurrences, very high monthly precipitation amounts can also have a reverse impact on occurrences. This applies to spring precipitation amounts for 
 <italic class="italic">An. messeae</italic>, and to summer precipitation for 
 <italic class="italic">An. sacharovi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sergentii</italic>.
