<p id="Par28" class="p">From the different configurations tested the best performance of the BRTs was achieved with learning rate = 0.005 and bag fraction = 0.5. For 
 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. messeae</italic>, which have a widespread occurrence in the European area and thus have a more equal number of grid boxes with presence to absence, the ratio 1:1 of pseudo-absence to presence data and tree complexity of 2 yields the best BRT model performance. For 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">labranchiae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. sacharovi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">An. sergentii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">superpictus</italic>, which have a smaller geographical range, the ratio 10:1 of pseudo-absence to presence and tree complexity of 3 gave the best results. Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2 and Figure S2 show for each vector the predictive performance of the best-performing BRT and maps of the modelled occurrence probabilities, respectively. The modelled spatial distributions showed a high agreement with the reference occurrence data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). The most noticeable discrepancy occurred for 
 <italic class="italic">An. atroparvus</italic> over the southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula, where vector presence is missed in the modelling.
