<p id="Par10" class="p">Projections of future climate change show that there will be significant warming rates until the end of the 21st century, strongest over north-eastern Europe in winter and over Central Europe and the Mediterranean area in summer. Precipitation is projected to increase mainly over North Europe in winter, whereas South Europe and the Mediterranean will likely see decreases the whole year round [

An assessment of possible future changes of the length of the malaria transmission season using climate output from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and different malaria impact models shows that until the 2080s a northward shift of the malaria epidemic belt over central-northern Europe might occur [
