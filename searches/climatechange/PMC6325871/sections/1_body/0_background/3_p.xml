<p id="Par11" class="p">In the context of global climate change GCMs are typically used to obtain large-scale climate information for future periods. However, GCMs do not provide reliable information on regional to local scales. Thus, different downscaling approaches have been developed. In general, they can be divided into statistical downscaling (establishing a statistical link between large-scale atmospheric predictors and regional to local climate) and dynamical downscaling, i.e. nesting a regional climate model (RCM) into a GCM with higher grid box resolution [

Current RCMs can reproduce the most important climatic features such as temperature and precipitation at regional scales, but some important biases still remain. These refer for instance to local heavy precipitation events and are related to the convective parameterizations, grid resolution and other aspects of the model formulation [
