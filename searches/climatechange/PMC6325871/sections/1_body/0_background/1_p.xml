 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The decline of malaria is strongly related to socio-economic improvements such as wealth, life expectancy and urbanization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, in recent years an increasing number of imported malaria cases occurs due to international travel and immigrants from malaria-endemic countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Together with the occurrence of vector competent 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> species and favorable climatic conditions autochthonous malaria cases may re-emerge in countries where malaria was previously eradicated. Since the late 1990s locally transmitted cases have been reported in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. In general, malaria transmission in Europe is highly seasonal owing to temperate climatic conditions. The Mediterranean area, with mild and wet winters and hot and dry summers, has been and still is suitable for malaria transmission. The dominant
