<p class="p">For this study, we used a process-based land surface model, the Common Land Model (CoLM), to simulate ET in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China from 2001â€“2012. Major objectives of the study were the following: (1) improve the performance of the CoLM for simulating ET (shrubland and cropland); (2) restructure the temporal and spatial distribution of ET; and (3) investigate the relative contributions of climate change and LCC on ET variability.</p>
