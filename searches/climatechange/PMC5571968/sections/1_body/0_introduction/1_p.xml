 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Evapotranspiration (ET), an important component of hydrological processes, plays a critical role in the global water budget. Oki and Kanae [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] reported that global land ET returns approximately 60% of annual land precipitation to the atmosphere, indicating that asynchronous changes in ET may lead to severe hydrological deficits [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Additionally, ET consumes more than half of solar radiation in the form of latent heat [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Shukla and Mintz [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] indicated that the Northern Hemisphere would be 15°C– 25°C warmer if land ET was assumed to be zero, suggesting important implications for regional climate variability. From 1982 to 1997, global annual ET increased at an average rate of 0.71 mm/year but stalled and even decreased coincident with the last major El Niña event of 1998, with the decreasing trend continuing until 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] reported that reduced ET growth between 1998 and 2008 was an episodic phenomenon, with subsequent recovery for the ET growth rate following 2008. Although efforts have been made to investigate ET variability on a global scale, a comprehensive analysis of ET changes and their response to environment factors (e.g., climate variability and land cover change (LCC)) are still lacking on a regional scale.
