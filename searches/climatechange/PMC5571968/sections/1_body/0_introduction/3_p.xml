<p class="p">The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China is located deep inside the Eurasian continent and is characterized by extreme low precipitation and high temperatures. The region is unique and, over the years, has experienced a dynamic land-use history and climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that annual mean temperatures for this region have increased at an average rate of 0.39Â°C/decade from 1979 to 2011. Additionally, from 1982 to 2011, precipitation within this region has also experienced an increase at a rate of 8 mm/decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, this dramatic rise in both temperature and precipitation stalled and even turned into decrease since the 21

 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. With a constant increase in population and accelerating industrial development and urbanization, oases (as a primary site for human settlement due to the availability of fertile soils and fresh runoff from surrounding mountains) have significantly expanded within this region [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Following the expansion of oases, local native vegetation was modified by irrigation and cultivation, as well as reclamation, and most native vegetation has been changed into cropland. Previous study has concluded that climate change plays a dominant role in controlling ET variability over large regions, whereas land-use changes have dramatically affected ET within watersheds with significant land conversion [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps still exist for understanding ET in response to changing climate and land cover in this typical arid/semi-arid region.
