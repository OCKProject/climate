<p class="p">Local scale measurements and observations of ET have been widely conducted within various ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, dense global or regional coverage ET cannot be represented using field measurements. Satellite- and statistics-based technologies have provided an alternative method for estimating ET on global and regional scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] although neither of these methods can qualify the relative roles of environmental factors in controlling ET. Land surface models (LSMs) provide a possible resolution for simulating ET and quantifying the contributions of various environmental factors on ET. However, most global LSMs underestimate ET within arid/semi-arid regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A possible reason for this phenomenon is that most current LSMs cannot capture special vegetation structures and their related functioning. When soil water is limiting, most species within dryland ecosystems do not suffer from water stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Several adaptive mechanisms can account for this finding. Being challenged with climates with extreme aridity and heat conditions, species have evolved into rich and deep root distributions with high root/shoot ratios [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and these specific morphological root distributions can influence ET through impacts on water uptake. Additionally, Zheng and Wang [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] reported that some stressed portions of the root zone do not necessarily indicate the water stress of entire plants. As a result, reduced water uptake from the stressed portion of the root zone can be compensated for by enhanced water uptake over portions of the root zone where water is more available. Furthermore, hydraulic redistribution (HR) is a widespread phenomenon where plant roots take-up water from deep moist soils and redeposit it into the upper soil layer at night for the purpose of root uptake to sustain daytime transpiration [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Although the above processes play a vital role in influencing ET within arid/semi-arid regions, few LSMs have taken conjointly into consideration when simulating ET.
