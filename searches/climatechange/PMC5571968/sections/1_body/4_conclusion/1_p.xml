<p class="p">For this study, we provided a modified process-based land surface model (CoLM) for estimating ET in Xinjiang, China. Following modification by adding irrigation effects for cropland and modifying root distributions and the root water uptake process for shrubland, the CoLM was determined to provide high performance in simulating ET when compared to field measurements. The CoLM estimated a mean regional ET of 131.22 (±21.78) mm/year for Xinjiang from 2001–2012. Due to the relatively short time period, our estimate did not show a significant temporal trend for ET variability. The results of this study indicated that climate change plays a negative role in ET variability. Reduced precipitation, in conjunction with decreased temperature, reduced ET by approximately 28.45 mm. Our results also suggest that climate change played a dominant role in determining inter-annual variability in ET. Furthermore, cropland conversation was a critical factor for altering the spatial pattern of ET in Xinjiang. Our study highlights the need for taking appropriate strategies to manage water sources in Xinjiang, China.</p>
