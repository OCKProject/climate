 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> shows the temporal and spatial patterns of CoLM-estimated annual ET in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. From 2001 to 2012, we estimated a mean annual regional land-surface ET value of 131.22 (Â±21.78) mm/year. Average ET in this region exhibited significant inter-annual variability with a maximum in ET (166.09 mm) in 2003 and a minimum (97.39 mm) in 2008. No significant trend was determined for our study period (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g006" class="xref">Fig 6(A)</xref>. Our results illustrate substantial spatial variations in ET across the study area. Approximately 13.5% of the pixels in this region experienced an increase in ET and only about 1% of the pixels were significant in southern areas. Decreased ET largely occurred in east areas and about 19.7% of the pixels were significant.
