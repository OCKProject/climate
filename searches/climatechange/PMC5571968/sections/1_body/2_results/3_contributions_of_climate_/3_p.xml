<p class="p">Climate impacts on ET were negative over the majority of the study area. Approximately 88.3% of areas experienced a decrease in the CLIM-only scenario and only 20% of areas were significant. The spatial patterns of ET changes were very similar to precipitation. In the Tianshan Mountains the rate of decrease in ET exceeded 8 mm per year in some pixels and precipitation significantly decreased, indicating that the declining trend in ET was limited to the decrease of precipitation.</p>
