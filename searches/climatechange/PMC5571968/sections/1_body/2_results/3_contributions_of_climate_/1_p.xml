<p class="p">Based on the results of scenario simulations, ET in response to LCC varied with time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The combined effect of both LCC and climate change reduced ET about 21.09 mm during the period from 2001 to 2012. Statistical analyses indicated that the LCC only accounted for 1% of the temporal variability of ET. The LCC simulation indicated that ET was enhanced by 1.11 mm from 2001 to 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g007" class="xref">Fig 7(B)</xref>). More detailed information for LCC impacts on ET can be determined using the spatial distribution of ET variability based on the LCC scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). Land conversion enhanced ET up to approximately 43.3% of pixels, and 13.8% of pixels were significant within southwestern Xinjiang and the northern Tianshan Mountains where the land cover type is primarily cropland (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g001" class="xref">Fig 1(B)</xref>). Enhanced ET within the northern Tianshan Mountains may have resulted from an increase in croplands following 2001. Approximately 51.2% of pixels underwent a decrease in ET but only 6.2% of pixels, such as those in northern areas, were significant.
