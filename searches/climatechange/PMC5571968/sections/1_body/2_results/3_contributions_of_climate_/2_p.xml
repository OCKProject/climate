<p class="p">Our model simulation suggested that climate effects accounted for 99% of the inter-annual variability of ET. During 2001–2012, the ET decreased with large fluctuations, especially during 2008 when ET decreased by approximately 17 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The CLIM simulation indicated that ET decreased by 21.90 mm from 2001 to 2012. Among climate factors, temperature change resulted in a 9.09 mm reduction and precipitation change resulted in a 23.55 mm reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g007" class="xref">Fig 7(B)</xref>). To illustrate the temporal correlation between ET and climate factors, we computed linear trends for temperature and precipitation from 2001 to 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). Our results indicated no significant trend for precipitation while temperature significantly decreased from 2001–2012 at a rate of 0.08°C/year. The temporal pattern of ET simulated using the CLIM scenario was coincident with precipitation. According to both PREC and TEMP simulations, the ET in 2008 was almost lowest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g007" class="xref">Fig 7(A)</xref>), suggesting that the dramatic decline in ET in 2008 may have resulted from a decrease in both precipitation and temperature.
