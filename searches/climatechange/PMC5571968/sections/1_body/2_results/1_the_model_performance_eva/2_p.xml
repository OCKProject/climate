<p class="p">Our results indicated that modified CoLM simulations were more comparable to observations at the FK (Fukang) site than the default CoLM. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows that CoLM-estimated ET had a higher performance in catching seasonal patterns by adding HR and modifying RWUF. A high ET occurred during the growing season and a low ET occurred during the winter. However, ET was underestimated especially during the growing season by using the default CoLM. The CoLM modified using both the HR and RWUF produced a more significant linear relationship than that modified by HR, with
