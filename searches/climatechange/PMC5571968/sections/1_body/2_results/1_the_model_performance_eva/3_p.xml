<p class="p">Because of a lack of situ observations, two flux tower observations, adjacent to our study area were also used to compare to our simulation. A strong linear relationship obtained from the CoLM modified using both the HR and RWUF was determined (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.90,

 <italic class="italic">RMSE</italic> was 2.71 and 1.42 mm/day at the KZ-Bal and KZ-Ara sites, respectively. The results imply that overall predictions for the modified CoLM matched well with field observations. The CoLM modified by either the HR or RWUF did not impact performance for simulating ET for grass types at the KZ-Bal site. Finally, the CoLM modified using both the HR and RWUF was selected for performing regional simulations.
