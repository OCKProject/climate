<p class="p">We evaluated the spatial pattern of modified CoLM-simulated ET at the regional level by comparing it to the MODIS product (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183071.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Average ET estimated using the CoLM agreed well with MODIS ET in terms of the spatial pattern from 2001–2012. High ET occurred in Tianshan and Altai mountainous areas, and low ET occurred in the Taklimakan Desert and adjacent areas. Our estimated ET was 131.22 (±21.78) mm /year, higher than the 91.17 (±5.85) mm/year derived from MODIS ET over the whole Xinjiang region. The discrepancy may result from a lack of values surrounding Taklimakan Desert areas for MODIS datasets. We further compared CoLM-estimated ET to MLA-estimated ET which is derived from Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Our estimates displayed a similar spatial pattern with MLA estimates, but a discrepancy in magnitude still existed. ET based on the MLA was ~200 mm/year for areas located in the south of our study area and was larger than our estimates of ~100 mm/year. Estimates for ET over Xinjiang were also less than MLA estimates, with values of 175.03 (±4.06) mm/year.
