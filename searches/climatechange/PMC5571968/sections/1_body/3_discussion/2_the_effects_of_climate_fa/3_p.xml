<p class="p">Climate change and variability directly impact the spatial distribution of ET changes. In the Tianshan Mountains, temperature decreased significantly and was associated with decreasing ET. As is known, temperatures in high elevation regions are generally low and limit vegetation activity. Such a finding is supported by multiple remote sensing studies that have determined that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation activity, in high altitudes is negatively correlated with temperature [
