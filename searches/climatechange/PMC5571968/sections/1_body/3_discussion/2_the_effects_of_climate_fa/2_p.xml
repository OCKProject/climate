<p class="p">Our model simulation indicated that climate change and variability plays a negative role in controlling ET changes. Climate change reduced ET by 21.90 mm from 2001 to 2012. Among climate factors, temperature change resulted in a 9.09 mm reduction and precipitation change resulted in a 23.55 mm reduction. The combined effects of TEMP and PREC contributed to 28.45 mm reduction. Therefore, a large proportion of ET variability could not be explained by both precipitation and temperature alone. And other factors such as solar radiation and wind, etc. should be taken into consideration when interpreting climate change impacts on ET. According to our correlation analysis, the determined coefficient (
