<p class="p">We modeled the spatial and temporal pattern of ET changes and determined that the LCC contributed to the increase of regional ET. The increase in ET mainly occurred in regions where croplands were distributed. In these regions, the area of croplands underwent an increase of up to 11% that resulted in an upward trend for ET. Our results support previous conclusions that areas with significant land conversions dramatically affect ET on regional scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] reported that all increased cropland in Xinjiang resulted from dryland ecosystems such as shrublands, grasslands, and deserts that sustain their growth through irrigation. Due to irrigation and large leaf area indices, cropland has a higher ET than other land cover types. Tao et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] reported that local human activities (such as irrigation) led to a decrease of the water volume diverted into the main stream of the Tarim River Basin in Xinjiang. The results of our study emphasized the significant impact of human activities on land-surface water sources, especially in arid/semi-arid regions where fresh available water largely results from runoff.
