<p class="p">Our modified model performance evaluation yielded a reasonable representation for ET estimates at the site level, and some differences may exist when compared to other surface ET products. The following uncertainties should be taken into consideration in interpretations of model estimates. As discussed above, the climate forcing data set is the primary factor controlling ET estimates, so assessments of different forcing data set impacts on ET estimates should be made and more accurate climate datasets at regional scales should be investigated in future research. Model structures and simplifications for some of the hydrological processes may also cause uncertainties. With the exception of climate and land cover change, we did not include the effects of other factors such as nitrogen deposition, ozone pollution, nitrogen fertilizer application, and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. Although former studies have indicated that nitrogen deposition and elevated carbon dioxide may not be as important as climate variability and land cover change on ET variability [
