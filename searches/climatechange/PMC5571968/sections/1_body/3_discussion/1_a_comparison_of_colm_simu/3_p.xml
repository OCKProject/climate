<p class="p">The CoLM-estimated ET was larger than a regional terrestrial ET of 119.2 (Â±9.9) mm/year estimated by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], who used another process-based model (CLM 2.0). The differences may come from different forcing datasets. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] used global reanalysis forcing data from Qian et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and interpolated surface data based on meteorological observations in order to feed the CLM 2.0. We used global reanalysis data from Princeton [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] reported that reanalysis data sets contain large discrepancies for arid/semi-arid areas that have different accuracies in capturing terrain- and long-term drought-induced effects.
