<p class="p">Additionally, current LSMs studies have a common problem with regard to underestimating ET in dryland ecosystems. Although deep root distribution and related root water uptake processes are important for the structure and function of dryland ecosystems, deep-root mechanisms are rarely considered in most land surface models [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In comparison, the improved CoLM in this study can address root distributions in deep soils based on field measurements. Besides, the process of RUWF is an important factor in controlling ET. Li et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] has reported that linear RUWF in the default CoLM is the main reason that resulted in underestimating ET. An adjustment of RUWF from linear to nonlinear is expected to a reasonable solution to improve the performance of CoLM in simulating ET. In this study, the value of m in RUWF has been determined empirically from 1 to 0.01 based on the field measurements at FK station, which indicates that more soil water in modified CoLM will be absorbed than that in default CoLM. HR is also an important physical process contributing to dynamic root water uptake in plants that plant roots take-up water from deep moist soils and redeposit it into the upper soil layer at night for the purpose of root uptake to sustain daytime transpiration. This phenomenon has also been widely verified by previous studies in our study area [
