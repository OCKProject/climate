<p class="p">Our estimated mean value of ET is lower than that of Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] who reported a regional terrestrial ET of 175.03 (±4.06) mm/year from 2001–2011. The ET estimation of Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] was upscaled from eddy covariance flux measurements to the global scale using a MLA method based on auxiliary remote sensing data. However, the method is a highly empirical mathematic model that does not consider environment factors and mechanisms. As reported, climate variability and LCC play a vital role in controlling ET changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In addition to these uncertainties, the MLA ET was largely based on flux tower measurements. However, flux towers in Xinjiang are sparse and highly uneven in distribution. In addition to these shortcomings, flux tower measurements themselves are often associated with an energy balance closure problem. All of the above-listed uncertainties could make the data less representative for the entire Xinjiang region.
