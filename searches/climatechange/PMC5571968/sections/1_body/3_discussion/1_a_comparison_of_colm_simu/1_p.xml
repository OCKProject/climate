 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, a lack of available field measurements (partially due to very limited or possibly biased samples) has made it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of ET estimates over the entire Xinjiang region. Based on the process-based CoLM, we estimated a mean annual ET of 131.22 (±21.78) mm/year for the period from 2001 to 2012, which is highly comparable with 130.64 mm/year estimated by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] who used a remote sensing model (SEBS). However, in recent studies using a remote sensing method, Mu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] estimated a regional terrestrial ET of 91.17 (±5.85) mm/year, which is much lower than the CoLM-simulated terrestrial ET. A detailed comparison between the ET of the CoLM and other estimates is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183071.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Recent studies have indicated several issues and uncertainties when retrieving ET using a remote sensing approach, and most of these uncertainties are related to surface variables such as land surface temperature, solar radiation, etc. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Furthermore, the MODIS ET product from Mu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] does not cover sparse vegetation areas (i.e., deserts and the Gobi) due to limitations of retrieved vegetation index with negative values for dryland ecosystems, especially in Xinjiang.
