<p class="p">The 3-hour climate dataset from 1996 to 2012 at one degree was obtained from Princeton University and includes temperature, precipitation, downward short- and long-wave radiation, specific humidity, surface air pressure, and wind speed [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The Princeton dataset is one of the most widely used reanalysis climate datasets for driving land surface models. The vegetation distribution map from 2001 to 2012 was derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land cover type products (MCD12C1.005) at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degree. The classification method was performed according to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). Other input datasets included soil texture, soil color, and a topographic map (elevation) from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) used to define land surface characteristics.
