<p class="p">To evaluate the performance of the CoLM in simulating ET, four flux tower observations at the site level were used to validate our model simulation. Detailed descriptions of the flux towers are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183071.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Two ET datasets were used to compare our simulations at a regional level. One was produced by the Penmanâ€“Monteith equation driven by MODIS data and daily meteorological data (MOD16A3) [
