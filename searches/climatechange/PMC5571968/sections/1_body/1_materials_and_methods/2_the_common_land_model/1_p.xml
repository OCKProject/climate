<p class="p">The CoLM used in this study is a process-based land surface model that allows simulations of biogeochemical and biophysical mechanisms, including representations of water, carbon, and energy processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The initial version of the model (Community Land Model (CLM)) was proposed in order to provide a framework for a true community developed land component for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM), and has been updated and developed by open scientific collaboration. The last version of the model (CoLM) used a one-layered, two-big-leaf sub-model for photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, and energy fluxes instead of the big-leaf treatment of the CLM for overcoming overestimations of CO

 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Model performance has been validated on a global scale over time using extensive field data for various biomes. Like most other land surface models, CoLM builds on the concept of plant functional types to describe vegetation attributes. CoLM handles the effects of LCC by changing spatially explicit LCC datasets. However, underestimations of water fluxes still exist because the model cannot capture the form and structure of desert plants and related root functions. Besides, it also cannot account for irrigation effects on ET for cropland. We provide a brief description of these processes below, in order to discuss the CoLM modifications we employed for cropland and shrubland.
