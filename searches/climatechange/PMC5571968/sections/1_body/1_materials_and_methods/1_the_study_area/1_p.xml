<p class="p">Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (34°N-49°N, 73°E-96°E) is one of the driest regions in the world. Approximately 73% of the land area (1.66 M km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) is covered by deserts, while a lower percentage (~9%) is covered by desert vegetation primarily dominated by xeric shrubs (e.g.,

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, Xinjiang has undergone dramatic land-use changes and cropland increased by 11% from 2001 to 2012. During the period from the 1980s to 1990s, Xinjiang experienced a significant warming and increasing wet trend [

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century [
 <xref rid="pone.0183071.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Mean annual precipitation is lower than 200 mm/year yet displays divergent spatial patterns of less than 50 mm/year for the Taklimakan Desert and more than 400 mm/year for the Tianshan Mountains. Mean annual temperatures vary from ~3°C within the Tianshan Mountains to ~13°C within the Taklimakan Desert.
