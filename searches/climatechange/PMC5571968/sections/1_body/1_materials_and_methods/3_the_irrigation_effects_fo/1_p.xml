<p class="p">Water is the most limiting resource for sustaining crop production in agricultural oases in Xinjiang, and almost 90 percent of agricultural water was used for irrigation [

We hypothesized that the irrigation was activated when available water in the topsoil layers with the depth of 0.3 m decreases to a threshold of the maximum available water (field capacity minus wilting point) during the growing season. After the irrigation, the soil moisture will reach the field capacity. This method has been widely applied in other studies [
