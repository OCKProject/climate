<p class="p">First, two simulations were designed to assess the irrigation effects for cropland at WLWS station. One simulation was executed with adding irrigation effects and the other without adding irrigation effects. And then the estimated ET of above two simulations was compared to observations. Second, we ran four simulations to validate the performance of improved CoLM in shrubland at FK station. The first simulation runs with adding HR; the second with modifying RWUF; the third with both adding HR and modifying RWUF; the last with default runs. And then, all the outputs of above simulations were compared to observations. Finally, six simulations were designed to quantify the relative contributions of the two factors (LCC and climate change) to ET variability (

One simulation was termed “LCC_CLIM” and was designed to assess the combined effects of climate and land cover change on ET from 2001 to 2012. Other simulations were designed for assessing ET variability on individual factors or a subset of environmental factors. “LCC”, “PREC”, and “TEMP” simulated the individual effects of land cover change, precipitation, and temperature, respectively. “CLIM” simulated the combined effects of all climate factors (e.g., precipitation, temperature, radiation). “COMB” simulated the combined effects of both temperature and precipitation. In the factorial analyses, only the factor(s) under investigation varied over time while other environmental drivers were kept at the 2001 initial level. To prevent abnormal fluctuations, an equilibrium run was designed prior to each simulation in order to make the natural ecosystem reach an equilibrium state. For this step, the model was driven by the initial climate state in 1996.
