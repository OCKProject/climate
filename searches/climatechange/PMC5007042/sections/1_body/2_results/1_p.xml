<p class="p">We sampled blood from 959 loggerhead turtles with SCL ranging from 42.8–75.9 cm and conducted laparoscopies on 58 of them. Of the 946 whose sex was determined, 710 were female and 236 were male (

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Water temperature at which turtles were sampled was 20°C or greater. Plasma testosterone concentrations for all turtles ranged from 0.1–11,420 pg/ml (N = 959). The sex ratio of laparoscoped turtles was 2.9F:1.0M. Plasma testosterone concentrations for laparoscoped females ranged from 6.7–432.0 pg/m (N = 43) while males ranged from 372.0–1884.0 pg/ml (N = 15). There was some overlap in testosterone concentration of males with females: one male (372.0 pg/ml) had a lower testosterone concentration than two of the females (394.1 and 432.3 pg/ml). Therefore, we determined that turtles having testosterone values of 371 pg/ml or less would be categorized female, turtles having testosterone values of 433 pg/ml or greater would be categorized male, and turtles having testosterone values 372–432 pg/ml would be categorized unknown (
