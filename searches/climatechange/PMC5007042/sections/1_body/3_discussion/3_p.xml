<p class="p">In addition to representing environmental conditions from several decades ago, our population of juvenile loggerheads comprises multiple genetic nesting populations that in turn reflect different incubation environments. For instance, a study of the genetic composition of a foraging population in North Carolina, revealed that 80% of the turtles originated from the south Florida nesting population, 12% were from the northeast Florida to North Carolina nesting population, 6% from Yucatan, Mexico, and 2% from other rookeries [

While warmer beaches of the south Florida nesting population might be contributing a high percentage of female hatchlings to the population, the more northern and cooler nesting beaches from the northeast Florida to North Carolina nesting populations might mitigate that highly skewed female ratio by producing proportionally more male hatchlings [
