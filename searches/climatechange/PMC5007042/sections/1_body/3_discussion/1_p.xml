<p class="p">Despite concerns about potential changes in sex ratios of animals displaying TSD because of predicted warming conditions, during this study we found that the sex ratio of juvenile loggerhead sea turtles inhabiting North Carolina inshore waters did not change significantly from 1998–2007, nor was there a significant change in sex ratios among the different 5-cm SCL size classes (
