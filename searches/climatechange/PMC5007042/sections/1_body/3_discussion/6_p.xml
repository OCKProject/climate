 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Most other studies only look at a populationâ€™s sex ratio at a particular point in time. In contrast, our study is one of the first to examine sex ratios over a broad time span, encompassing ten years and sampling over 950 juvenile loggerhead turtles
