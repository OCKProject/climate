<p class="p">Primary sex ratios for most loggerhead sea turtle populations, derived from nest temperatures or incubation durations [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], have been found to be strongly female-biased (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] for a review), with some populations in the western North Atlantic consisting of 90% or more females [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Although still biased towards females, sex ratios of foraging juvenile loggerhead populations are not as highly skewed, displaying a 2F:1M ratio in Florida and Virginia [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], 3F:1M in North Carolina [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], 2F:1M in the northeast Atlantic [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and 1.56F:1M in the Mediterranean [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, operational sex ratios (estimated from adults actively breeding in a season) potentially appear to be more balanced [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] because male sea turtles breed more frequently than females and mate with multiple females, thus, providing a more balanced operational sex ratio despite a populationâ€™s highly skewed primary sex ratio.
