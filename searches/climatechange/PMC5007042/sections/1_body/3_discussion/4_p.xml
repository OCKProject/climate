<p class="p">Conversely, a lack of a trend in our sex ratio data may indicate that loggerheads are adapting to warming temperatures. In fact, some have proposed that TSD might actually be an unexpected adaptation that could enable animals to survive warming effects of climate change [

For instance, nesting in different substrates, latitudes, or depths, or nesting during cooler time periods (at the beginning or end of the nesting season) could enable turtles to mitigate the harmful effects of increasing temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. As an example, a ten day earlier median nesting date for a population of loggerheads nesting along Floridaâ€™s Atlantic coast from 1989 to 2003 was recorded [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. During the consequential longer nesting season, red-eared slider females laid an extra clutch when soil temperatures were relatively low, leading to the production of additional males [
