<p class="p">Although sea turtles have survived past geologic temperature fluctuations, the methods used to cope with past changes and the speed with which those changes occurred is not known [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Current predicted climate changes are projected to happen at relatively rapid rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and little empirical knowledge about the ability of sea turtles to survive these changes is available. If warming global temperatures result in detrimental changes to population sex ratios, animals with TSD could react in a number of waysâ€“with an evolutionary response by modifying pivotal temperatures or changing to genotypic sex determination, an ecological response by altering geographic ranges or timing of nesting, or by becoming extinct [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Sea turtle populations are currently imperiled due to a number of anthropogenic threats including habitat alteration and loss, pollution, and incidental capture in fisheries [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. If sea turtles are not able to adjust to impending climate changes, the result could be detrimental. Therefore, long-term monitoring of sea turtle populations should continue; however, studies should focus more on investigation of secondary, rather than primary, sex ratios, so that accurate assessments can detect changes in time for mitigation measures to be effective.
