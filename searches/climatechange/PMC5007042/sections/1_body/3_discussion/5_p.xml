Many studies quantifying the effects of climate change on sea turtle population sex ratios have focused attention on monitoring hatchling sex ratios. However, considering the inherent intra- and inter-annual variation in hatchling sex ratios, the uncertainty associated with hatchling sex ratio estimation (i.e., estimates from small numbers of hatchlings or inferred from measured incubation temperatures or durations) [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], or the expense and logistical difficulty in sexing post-hatchling turtles [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], a more viable alternative would be to monitor changes in the sex ratio of the juvenile portion of the population [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Because this life stage integrates sex ratio variability over time [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and can be sexed measuring blood testosterone levels that are verified via laparoscopy, monitoring effects of climate change at this life stage might more accurately reveal if mitigation measures to climate change are warranted [
