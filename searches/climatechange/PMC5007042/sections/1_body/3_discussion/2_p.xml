<p class="p">There are a number of reasons why our study’s population sex ratio may not have exhibited any noticeable trend during this time period. Given the variation in annual hatchling sex ratios [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], along with sea turtles’ long-lived, late-maturing life history, a 10 year period likely is not long enough to reveal any changes occurring in a populations’ sex ratio. Another factor to consider is that loggerheads exhibit delayed maturation, with estimates of up to 45 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]; thus, the data yielded by neritic juveniles are representative of what environmental conditions were like approximately 10–20 years ago [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Furthermore, despite overall increases in global temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], long-term mean air temperatures of coastal North Carolina from 1940–2005 actually have decreased [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Because of the significant relationship demonstrated between air and sea surface temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], this indicates that hatchlings on these beaches may not have been exposed to warming temperatures during this time period.
