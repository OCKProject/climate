<p class="p">As part of an ongoing assessment of sea turtle populations along the US Atlantic coast [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], we investigated the long-term sex ratio of neritic juvenile loggerhead (
 <italic class="italic">Caretta caretta</italic>) sea turtles inhabiting Pamlico and Core Sounds, North Carolina, USA. We measured circulating testosterone levels with radioimmunoassay (RIA) and verified sex of a subset of the sampled turtles through visual examination of their gonads to establish a range of testosterone concentrations associated with each sex. We then compared estimated sex ratios over a 10-year period (1998â€“2007) and among 5-cm straight carapace length (SCL) size classes to determine if significant changes in sex ratios were occurring, potentially due to changes in the climate.
