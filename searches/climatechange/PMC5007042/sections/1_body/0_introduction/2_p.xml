<p class="p">Likewise, for those animals more susceptible to alterations in the thermal environment, a change in climate might have more adverse effects on a population [

In the case of ectotherms, whose survival and reproduction are strongly dependent upon thermal conditions, climate change could have serious consequences. For many reptile species, the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the hatchlings, a process known as temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) [reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]]. During a 5-yr study monitoring air temperature and sex ratios of hatchling painted turtles (
 <italic class="italic">Chrysemys picta</italic>), empirical evidence of the sensitivity of a species with TSD to even slight changes in temperature was provided [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The direct relationship between annual hatchling sex ratios and mean July air temperature was documented, which in some years produced 100% male or female hatchlings. Similar to painted turtles, sea turtle female offspring are produced at higher temperatures with male offspring produced at lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Thus, if the predicted rise in global temperatures results in a disproportionate number of female hatchlings and similarly skewed adult sex ratios, single-sex populations could be produced, eventually leading to demographic collapse [
