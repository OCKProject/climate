<p class="p">Since the mid-nineteenth century, a notable increase (0.6–0.8°C) in the Earth’s mean surface temperature has been documented and is continuing at an accelerated rate [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. As a result of this warming trend, changes have occurred and continue to manifest in the Earth’s biota including phenology (timing of seasonal activities) and physiology of organisms, range and distribution of species, composition of and interactions within and among communities, and structure and dynamics of ecosystems (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] for a review). Animal and plant phenology and geographic distribution are processes most commonly monitored to assess population response to climate change. In a review of the studied phenologies of 1,598 species, it was estimated that more than half (59%) had demonstrated noticeable changes during the past 20 to 140 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; earlier breeding (or first singing) of birds, flowering of plants, and spawning of amphibians are among the most common changes observed for plants and animals [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, in some cases, more extreme changes can occur with these temperature increases, such as invasions of warm-water species and the eradication of other species, which can have a greater impact on populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For example, in the tropics, increases in water temperature of less than 1°C can result in large-scale coral bleaching and ensuing mortality of all coral species [
