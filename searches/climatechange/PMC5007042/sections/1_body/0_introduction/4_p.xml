<p class="p">Alternatively, assessing the sex ratios of neritic juveniles (secondary sex ratio) might offer a better way of tracking trends in a population’s sex ratio [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Since the juvenile life stage in sea turtles is protracted, it represents many cohorts and, consequently, many years of hatchling production, incorporating sex ratio variability over time [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Moreover, random sampling of populations is possible, as neritic juveniles are less likely to have sex-specific behavioral biases displayed by adults [

Finally, methods used to sex juveniles are direct and non-lethal—gonads of stranded dead turtles are examined during necropsy or testosterone levels in the blood of live turtles are measured. When combined with laparoscopic verification of RIA results, blood testosterone can be an accurate means of determining sex of large numbers of juveniles [

Despite logistical difficulties in accessing neritic juveniles, estimated sex ratios at this stage might reveal a more accurate representation of a sea turtle population’s future reproductive potential and response to changes in the environment [
