<p class="p">While many researchers have recognized the potential negative effect climate change could have on sea turtle populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], only recently have studies begun to quantify these impacts, especially in terms of predicting skewed hatchling sex ratios [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Consequently, long-term monitoring of nesting sites was recommended so that potential future changes to primary (hatchling) sex ratios could be measured [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and necessary mitigation measures implemented in a timely manner. However, primary sex ratios are influenced by a variety of factors, including geographic location of nests, time of year eggs are laid, substrate in which eggs are laid, metabolic heating, and annual weather patterns [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and this variation can occur within the same beach over several years [

 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Moreover, primary sex ratios are generally estimated from the sex of a limited number of dead or live hatchlings salvaged from a few nests, or inferred from measured incubation temperatures or durations [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], which requires obtaining pivotal temperatures in a laboratory setting, as well as sacrificing a sufficient number of hatchlings for validation [
 <xref rid="pone.0160911.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. While non-lethal methods to sex post-hatchling turtles have been developed, they are expensive and logistically difficult [
