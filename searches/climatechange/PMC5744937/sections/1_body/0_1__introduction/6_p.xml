<p class="p">The richness of the archaeological and textual evidence from the Peloponnese has, up to now, not been matched by the quality of the paleoclimate information from the area [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This means that inferences about socio-environmental links rely on paleoclimate data from other areas of the eastern Mediterranean, which, considering local variability, is problematic [

 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Here, we present a high-resolution, stable isotope based climate record from stalagmite S1 that formed from 4687 to 1297 yrs BP, in three discrete growth periods. The record covers large parts of the Greek Bronze Age, during which the Peloponnese saw the development of interconnected and complex societies and the intensification of agriculture, although with strong regional variability [

 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The record further covers the period extending from late Hellenistic times through the transition to the Byzantine period. The S1 proxy record sheds new light on the effects of climate on, the large scale social reorganization that occurred ~4200 yrs BP, the expansion in the area embraced by Mycenaean civilization ~3400 yrs BP, the subsequent destruction of the Mycenaean palaces ~3200 yrs BP, and the expansion in the number of rural settlements in the late Roman period. Here, however, we evaluate and investigate principally the chronological fit between variability in climate and the destruction of the Mycenaean Palace at Pylos and the subsequent sociopolitical change that took place at the end of the palatial period on the Greek mainland.
