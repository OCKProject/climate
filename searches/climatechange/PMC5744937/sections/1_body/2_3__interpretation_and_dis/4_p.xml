<p class="p">The strong correlation between δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values in the three growth periods indicates that Stalagmite S1 did not form in isotopic equilibrium with its parent drip water. Few stalagmites form under true equilibrium conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], especially in semi-arid environments, and kinetic effects should be considered [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Kinetic fractionation is mainly driven by evaporation of drip water emerging in the cave due to low relative humidity (RH) in the cave air, and by the degassing of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the parent water due to differences in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> partial pressure (pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) between water and cave air. During drier climate conditions, δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O will be enriched by increased evaporation in the epikarst and in the cave due to low RH, and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C will be enriched by increased degassing connected to reduced drip rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], enhancing any signal of drought in the stalagmite. Additionally, PCP may enrich δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values and since this factor typically is enhanced during drier climate conditions, it also acts to enhance the enrichment signature of δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C during more arid phases. In short, a strong positive correlation between δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C is expected since both proxies respond to similar environmental drivers and similarly to kinetic effects. In addition, the closed nature of the cave and the high RH in the cave air (
