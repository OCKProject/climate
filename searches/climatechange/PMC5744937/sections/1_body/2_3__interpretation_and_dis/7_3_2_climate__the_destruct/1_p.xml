<p class="p">The sampling resolution in the Mavri Trypa record for the period 3350–3000 yrs BP (i.e. much of the LBA) is on average 5 years and the uncertainty in the age-depth model is on average ±31.5 years, making it one of the most precise paleoclimate records for the LBA in the eastern Mediterranean (

 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] argue are necessary in order to reliably compare archaeological events to climate data. Considering the proximity between Mavri Trypa and the Palace of Nestor, the paleoclimate information from this cave is pertinent for evaluating the potential impact of climate on the destruction of that Mycenaean palace and social processes during the subsequent periods. The archaeological chronology around 3200 yrs BP in the Peloponnese is generally well accepted, although some uncertainties remain. It is based on the cross-dating of ceramic material with “fixed points” in Egyptian chronology and contextually secure radiocarbon dates [

 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. We are thus able to rather precisely compare our paleoclimate data with the timing of the destruction of the Palace of Nestor and the end of the LBA in the Peloponnese.
