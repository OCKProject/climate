<p class="p">The destruction of the Palace of Nestor is thought to have occurred ~3150–3130 yrs BP [

 </bold>). There is no unequivocal evidence for a prolonged period of drier conditions in the Mavri Trypa record at that time. Instead, it appears that the period around 3150 yrs BP is one of generally wetter, albeit fluctuating, climate conditions marking the beginning of a transitional period that leads into a distinct period of drier conditions that exists from ~3100 yrs BP (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189447.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>
 </bold>). At the time of the destruction of the Palace there is a very short period of enriched δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O values (mainly defined by one measurement point); this fluctuation, however, is not evident in the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189447.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>
 </bold>). Considering the expected contribution of local noise to the δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O signal and the lack of response in the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, we suggest this enrichment cannot not be linked to drought, at least not of the magnitude seen around 3200 yrs BP and after 3100 yrs BP.
