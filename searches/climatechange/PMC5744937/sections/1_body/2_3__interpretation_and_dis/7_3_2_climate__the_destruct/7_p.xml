<p class="p">The new data from Mavri Trypa also provides an opportunity to investigate the climate backdrop to the question of why the Mycenaean elite did not re-form and why the Palace was not rebuilt. Many signs of political and social collapse are visible in Pylos and Messinia as a whole after the destruction of the Palace. For instance, there was no urban reconstruction or subsequent cultural regeneration on the acropolis or in the adjacent lower town at Pylos and a pronounced depopulation of Messinia is evident from survey results [

The clear trend toward aridity from 3150 yrs BP probably meant a gradual increase in the number of years of drought, leading to failed crops or strongly reduced yields, and, more importantly, that agricultural productivity in normal and good years was reduced [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. This in turn meant that it became increasingly difficult for farmers in Messinia to produce a ‘normal surplus’ that could be stored and taxed, either directly or socially, which has been argued to be an important mechanism behind the creation of social elites [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In an environment with developing aridity and reduced crop yields it would have become increasingly difficult to produce the ‘natural surplus’ that would enable a central authority to reassert itself by providing food relief, or trigger the formation of new social elites. There is, however, evidence for the continuation of small-scale subsistence farming in Messinia in LH IIIC and through the Early Iron Age (EIA), albeit at a much reduced scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The new evidence from Mavri Trypa makes it possible for the first time to situate the trajectory of events following the destruction of the Mycenaean Palace of Nestor at Pylos within a period of developing aridity throughout LH IIIC and the early part of the EIA.
