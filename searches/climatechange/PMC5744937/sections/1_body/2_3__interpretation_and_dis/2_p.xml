 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. In the Peloponnese, precipitation δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O values are more depleted during winter because of lower surface air temperature. However, in an annual cycle, there is a negative correlation between precipitation δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O and rainfall amount, i.e. depletion increases with the precipitation amount, especially when the monthly average is below 100 mm [

A series of stable oxygen and hydrogen measurements on precipitation samples collected ~40 km north of Mavri Trypa Cave between January 2012 and September 2015 confirm the inverse relationship between precipitation amount and δ

 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. A comparison between meteorological data and δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O values from a modern stalagmite from Kapsia Cave in the central Peloponnese reveals a strong connection between δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O depletion and an increase in the precipitation amount during the period of positive water excess (ONDJFMA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189447.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Considering the thickness of the bedrock above Mavri Trypa Cave, which is around 40 m, and that the catchment area for the karstic aquifer is relatively confined, given its location on an island, the climate signal from Mavri Trypa is not affected by aquifer mixing processes to a large extent. This could, however, also result in a relatively quick drying out of the aquifer under dry climate conditions. The two growth hiatuses and the inferred termination of deposition in Stalagmite S1 are likely a result of the aquifer drying out and they occur after longer periods of enriched δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values.
