<p class="p">Based on the above discussion we suggest that the δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O in the stalagmite from Mavri Trypa Cave should be interpreted as a signal for moisture, although there may be an influence of kinetic fractionation, with more negative δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O values indicating wetter conditions and vice versa. The δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C signal from Mavri Trypa may tentatively be used as a proxy for biological activity above the cave linked to moisture availability. However, in this paper we favor the use of δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O over δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C for making interpretations about past hydro-climatic variability, although we use the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C signal to better understand the δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O.
