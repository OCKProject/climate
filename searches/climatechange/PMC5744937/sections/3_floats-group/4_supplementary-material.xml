  <p class="p">A-D show micrite and new crystal nucleation (red arrows) at 197.5 mm depth from the top indicating a growth interruption. A and B show the same slide in crossed polar light and plane-polarized light respectively. C and D show the same slide in crossed polar light and plane-polarized light respectively. E and F show new crystal nucleation at 47.7 mm depth from the top in crossed polar light and plane-polarized light respectively, indicating a growth interruption. At this depth, there is also an almost perpendicular change in the direction of the growth axis (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189447.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). G shows a segment of the area between 55 and 145 mm depth from the top that has a more irregular and fibrous fabric toward the center compared to the flanks. Green arrows indicate direction of growth.
