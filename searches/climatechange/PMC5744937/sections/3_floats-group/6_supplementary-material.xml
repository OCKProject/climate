  <title class="title">Selected high-resolution stable isotope records from eastern and central Mediterranean compared the δ
   <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record from Mavri Trypa (this study).
  </title>
  <p class="p">Bold black lines for each record represent a running average. The running average was selected for each individual record to filter the average resolution to ~30 years, the lowest resolution in any record in the figure, in order to enhance comparability between records. Wetter climate conditions are up and drier down. Records are organized from west to east. For the δ
   <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record from Soreq Cave no running average was calculated for the period of low resolution (i.e. between 3600 and 2000 yrs BP).
  </p>
  <p class="p">Similarly, colored bars indicate possible parallel periods of wetter and drier conditions in other records from central and eastern Mediterranean. Question marks indicate less certain matching with the record from Mavri Trypa.</p>
