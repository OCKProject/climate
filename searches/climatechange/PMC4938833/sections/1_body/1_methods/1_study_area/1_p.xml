 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2009</xref>). The altitude ranges from 1100 m along the shores of Lake Victoria to 1800 m on the Nyabondo Plateau (Okere and Kodiwo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2012</xref>). The area shares climatic conditions of Lake Victoria Basin with a mean annual rainfall of between 600 to 1630 mm and temperature ranging from 18 to 34 °C. The location experiences two distinct extreme weather conditions—droughts and floods mainly ravaging West Nyakach Location. Water scarcity is often acute after short rainy seasons with the peak in January (Okere and Kodiwo

 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>. Ramogi, East Koguta, East and West Kadianga, Gari, Kajimbo, Anding’o Opanga, Upper Kadianga, West Koguta, Lower Kadiang’a and Nyong’ong’a whose climate is generally similar owing to their proximity to each other (GoK 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, on the basis of their location within Upper Nyakach Division, the 11 sub-locations can be broadly classified into three. Nyongonga and Lower Kadianga are located in the plains bordering Lake Victoria on the lower reaches of River Sondu. These two are prone to flooding and their main source of water is the lake. West Koguta, Upper Kadianga, Anding’o Opanga and Kadianga West, are located in a hilly terrain and both experience semi-arid conditions, with springs and wells serving as the major water sources for the inhabitants. Gari, Kajimbo, East Kadianga, East Kuguta and Ramogi sub-locations are located in a hilly terrain with relatively good weather that supports farming activities. The sources of water for the inhabitants include springs, rivers, wells and ponds. Basing on the 2009 Kenya population and housing census, Upper Nyakach Division has a population of 74,252 persons and a population density of about 435 persons per square kilometers (GoK 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010c</xref>). The dominant socio-economic activities for majority of households in the area are agriculture and livestock production for subsistence (Okere and Kodiwo
