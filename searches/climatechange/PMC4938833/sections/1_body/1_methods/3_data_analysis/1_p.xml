<p class="p">Quantitative data analyses were aided by the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20, Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4 and excel spreadsheet softwares. The data was first descriptively analyzed to give frequencies and proportions. Since descriptive statistics were not sufficient to determine significant relationships between dependent and independent variables, Chi square tests, were used to determine the association between variables. The relationship between awareness of climate change markers and the background factors was evaluated using GLM technique, whereby the dependent variable was climate change awareness, while independent variables were households’ head age, education level and gender. A respondent was considered aware of the climate change markers when he or she was able to mention at least four out of the seven climate change markers (i.e. declining frequency of rain, increasing frequency of rain, declining severity of temperature, increasing severity temperature, increasing frequency of floods, decreasing frequency of floods and severity of drought). As the awareness of the climate change markers data were in form of counts and demonstrated clear over-dispersion (evaluated graphically and by comparing the residual deviance with residual degree of freedom), GLMs assuming either Poisson or Negative binomial distribution with appropriate link function was used. Graphical methods were equally applied to assess model fit and ensure a linear relationship existed between the predictor and the link transformed outcome. Analyses were conducted in R version 3.0 (R Core Team, 2013). The threshold for statistical significance for this study was set at 95 % confidence level, thus a 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value of 0.5 or less (P ≤ 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The findings were presented summarily as texts, tables, and graphs. Qualitative data from KIIs and FGDs transcriptions were analyzed thematically. The results were then presented in form of textual expressions and direct quotations.
