<p class="p">Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to the impacts of climate change (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>; Densanker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2002</xref>). These adverse impacts of climate change have combined with poverty, poor policy and poor institutional frameworks to make the situation even worse (African Ministerial Conference on Environment [AMCEN] 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>). Ranking high among the impacts of climate change in Africa is food insecurity triggered by severely compromised agricultural production, dwindling fish stocks due to ecosystem changes, reduced livestock production due to grassland degradation and deforestation among others. These impacts are particularly exacerbated by climate change markers such as frequent droughts, unpredictable floods and change in rainfall patterns (Collier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2008</xref>).
