<p class="p">The climate change phenomenon is unmistakably intensifying in Kenya at an alarming rate (Government of Kenya 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2010a</xref>). The country and the greater East African region is already experiencing high temperatures (Herrero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2010</xref>). According to SEI (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2009</xref>), climate change projections indicate increases in mean annual temperature in Kenya of between 1 and 3.5 °C by the year 2050. This warming is likely to lead to depletion of glaciers on Mount Kenya (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>), declining water levels in many rivers and the subsequent interruptions in electricity generation (GoK 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2007</xref>). The impacts of climate change in Kenya have been severe and have often affected some of the key sectors of the economy due to potential threats to coastal zones as a result of sea level rise, health burdens, energy demand, infrastructure, water resources, agriculture and loss of ecosystem services (Kuria 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2009</xref>; SEI 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2009</xref>). The most vulnerable to these impacts are poor rural households that depend on the climate-sensitive sectors for survival (Mutimba et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>).
