<p class="p">A recent study by Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2015</xref>) concurs with past studies that climate change awareness and risk perception were unevenly distributed around the world in 2007–2008, with the highest levels of awareness (over 90 %) reported in the developed world, and by contrast, majorities in developing countries from Africa to the Middle East and Asia reported not having heard of climate change. Earlier climate change awareness studies conducted in the developed world revealed that the awareness level were high among respondents (Pew Research Centre

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2009</xref>), but still not a priority environmental issue in most of these countries (Leiserowitz

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013</xref>). On the contrary, studies conducted on climate change in developing countries reveal that the vast majority of people were unaware of climate change despite their high vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, (Pew Research Centre
