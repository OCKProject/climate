<p class="p">Several studies have reported that national, cultural and geographic factors play a key role in shaping individual-level perceptions and awareness of climate change (Leiserowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2006</xref>; Brechin and Bhandari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>). Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2015</xref>) thus emphasized on the importance of identifying the key individual-level predictors of climate change awareness and risk perception for each country separately. In the same study by Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2015</xref>), it was reported that a significant proportion of nations had different top-ranked predictors. For instance, awareness and perception of local temperature change is the strongest predictor of risk perceptions in many Asian and African countries. Their findings were particularly important because previous research also established that many individuals around the world have accurately detected recent changes in local temperature anomalies (Howe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2013</xref>). The current study sought to use climate change markers viz heavy rainfall, floods, drought and temperature which are commonly encountered and easily recognizable climate change markers to establish the communityâ€™s awareness of climate change in the Upper Nyakach Division of Kisumu County, Kenya. This knowledge would bridge the gap between policy formulation and building adaptive capacity to climate change.
