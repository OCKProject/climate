<p class="p">Owing to observational facts, it is imperative to understand the actual dynamics of climate change markers with reference to temperature, drought, floods and heavy rainfall and their impacts at the community and household levels (Deressa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>). Awareness of climate change and its impacts among households would prepare them to effectively cope or adapt to the impacts. As Mtambanengwe et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2012</xref>) observed, an assessment of the level of awareness on climate change and variability may contribute towards the formulation of adaptation strategies designed to improve rural livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. Various studies have revealed that climate change awareness and perception varies within and across regions (Pew Research Centre

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2009</xref>).
