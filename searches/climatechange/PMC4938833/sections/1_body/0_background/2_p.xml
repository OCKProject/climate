<p class="p">According to the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>), observational evidence from all the continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are already being affected by regional climatic changes. The most obvious manifestation of climate change is the rising temperature, melting of glaciers, rising of sea-level, changes in precipitation patterns, recurrent droughts and devastating floods; all of which are important climate change markers (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>). Available scientific evidence for instance shows that the earth experienced an average warming of approximately 0.6 °C during the twentieth Century (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2001</xref>) and is expected to warm by about 2–3 °C by the end of the 21st century (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>). According to Holdren (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2006</xref>), the last 50 years of the twentieth Century were the warmest in 600 years. Several other studies are in concordance that the frequency and severity of droughts and floods which are climate change markers have increased over the past 50 years, especially in the Eastern Africa region (Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics [FAOSTAT]
