<p class="p">It is projected that continued green house gas (GHG) emissions would induce many changes in the global climate system during the twenty-first century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the twentieth century (Pachauri and Spreng 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, there is increased likelihood that the impacts of climate change will advance in a non-linear and non-predictable manner. Climate change will have both positive and negative impacts, but the adverse effects will be felt much more strongly in developing countries (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2001</xref>). The negative impacts of climate change varies globally; though small-scale farmers particularly in developing countries suffer the most because of their dependence on rain-fed agriculture, limited financial capacity, low adaptive capacity, high dependence on natural resources, inability to detect the occurrence of extreme hydrological and meteorological events, limited infrastructure, illiteracy, lack of skills, low awareness levels and lack of capacity to diversify (Kurukulasuriya and Mendelssohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2006</xref>). As such, the problem and the challenges of climate change are becoming more threatening to sustainable development and the totality of human existence (Adejuwon, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2004</xref>).
