<p class="p">Most (64.8 %) households interviewed practiced crop farming as the main source of livelihood. Other livelihood sources included: salaried employment (24.1 %), trade (6.4 %), fishing (4.2 %), livestock rearing (2.1 %) and brick making (0.3 %). The findings showed a general over-reliance on crop farming by a majority of households though few households had diversified their sources of livelihoods.
