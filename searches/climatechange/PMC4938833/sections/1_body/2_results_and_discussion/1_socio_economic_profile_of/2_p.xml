<p class="p">With regards to gender of the household heads, the proportion of males and females in the study area were nearly equal with males accounting for 48.8 % and females 51.2 % of the respondents. This finding is not significantly different from that of the 2009 census report of the Kenya Bureau of Statistics (GoK 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010c</xref>) in which the distribution of males and females across the age groups were almost symmetrical. About 52.4 % of the respondents (household heads) had attained primary level of education, while 36 % had seconadry level of education. However, 4.2 % of the respondents had no education at all while only 4.8 and 2.1 % had attained tertiary and university education, respectively. These findings were nearly consistent with those reported in the KNBS 2009 census report which revealed that majority of Kenyans had attained primary level of education (51 %) followed by those who had attained secondary level of education at 17 % (GoK 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010c</xref>). However, while this study suggests that households are aware of the general change in climate, it established that there were varying levels of awareness of individual climate change markers (temperature, drought, heavy rainfall and floods among others).
