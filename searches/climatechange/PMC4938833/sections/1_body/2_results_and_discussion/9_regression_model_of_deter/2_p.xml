<p class="p">The current findings are inconsistent with those reported by LVBC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>) which previously found insignificant differences between climate change awareness with background factors. However, the study support findings by Ndambiri et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2012</xref>) which showed a relationship between age, gender and education and climate change awareness. Similarly, Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) reported significant differences in climate change awareness with respect to education level and age although their study looked at age in general. Although education level of the respondent wasÂ found to have an impact on the awareness of the respondent in the current study, the influence was not significant at tertiary level of education. This could be due to the fact that few individuals in this category might have specialized in other areas of interest and had little interest on matters of climate change.
