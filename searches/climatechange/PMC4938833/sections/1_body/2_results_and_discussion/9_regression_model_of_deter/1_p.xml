<p class="p">Overall, from the full Poisonâ€“GLm model of important variables for the awareness of climate change markers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), only gender of the household head (when the gender was a male), education and age of the respondents significantly predicted awareness of climate change markers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) even as youth and middle age (borderline significant) groups were found to be more aware of the climate change markers than their adult counterparts.
