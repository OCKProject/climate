<p class="p">A Chi square test revealed significant differences across gender of the respondents with regard to observed changes in drought frequency (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 10.592, df = 2, P = 0.005) with fewer male respondents having agreed that droughts are either getting less frequent or that there has been no change at all compared to their female counter parts. However, the differences regarding observed changes in drought frequency were not significant among the age groups (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 6.148, df = 4, P = 0.188) as was with the levels of education (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 25.131, df = 8, P = 0.291) and households’ livelihoods type (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 22.490, df = 10, P = 0.060). These findings contradicts those of Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Ndambiri et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2012</xref>) which reported that gender and education level of respondents had significant effects on awareness of climate change.
