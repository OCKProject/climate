<p class="p">According to United States Geological Survey, USGS (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2011</xref>), increased frequency of droughts observed in the last 20 years is likely to continue (as long as global temperatures continue to rise). This is evidenced by the current study findings as 75 % of the respondents reported that droughts had become more frequent over the years as opposed to 22 % who believed otherwise and 3 % who had not observed any change at all over the past 20 years. On the severity of drought, 68.5 % of the households had observed that drought events in the area are increasingly getting severe as opposed to 29.1 % who observed a decrease in severity of drought events. A small proportion (2.4 %) did not observe any change over the years.
