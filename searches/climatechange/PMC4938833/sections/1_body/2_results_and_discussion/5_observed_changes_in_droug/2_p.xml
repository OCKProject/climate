<p class="p">The large proportion of households that had observed drought occurrence in the Upper Nyakach Division was consistent with findings of LVBC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>) that drought events have increased within the Lake Victoria Basin (of which the study area is part). Majority of the households observed increased frequency (74 %) and severity (68.5 %) of drought events over the last 20 years, which is in agreement with the NEMA (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2008</xref>) report in which serious drought events were reported to have occurred in the country at least 12 times in the past (50 years). Humanitarian Information Unit, HIU (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2007</xref>) asserted that Kenya is frequently affected by severe drought and that based on historical rainfall records, there is greater than 40 % likelihood that Western Kenya will most likely experience severe drought within the rainy seasons of any given year. Studies by FAOSTAT (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2000</xref>) and UNEP (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2002</xref>) reported that the frequency and severity of droughts and floods have increased over the past 50 years, especially in Eastern Africa. This shows that the study finding on the trend of droughts in the area is consistent with both observed and projected drought trends at both national and regional levels.
