<p class="p">Significant differences were observed among the different education levels on awareness of changes relating to malaria cases (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 19.369, df = 8, P = 0.013) with respondents who attained primary and secondary level of education and above having observed increasing cases of malaria (by proportion). Similar results were observed across the households’ main livelihoods (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 14.331, df = 10, P &lt; 0.0001) with the proportion of those who had observed an increase in malaria cases over the past years being larger amongst fishermen and livestock keepers than amongst those engaged in other forms of livelihoods. These findings contradicted those of the LVBC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>) which stated that differences in climate change awareness among respondents with different livelihoods (occupation) were not significant. In the current study, differences observed on awareness of the changes in malaria cases among different age groups were not significant (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 4.607, df = 4, P = 0.330). The current findings concurred with those of Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Ndambiri et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2012</xref>) which also reported that gender and age have significant effect on climate change awareness. This gender gap could be due to differences between men and women in access to weather information, education differences, or lack of basic channels of communication such as radio and television set.
