<p class="p">Majority of the respondents interviewed (74 %) reported an increased prevalence of malaria. However 23 % of the households believed that fewer people were falling ill (malaria cases have reduced) while 3 % have seen no change at all regarding malaria cases in their area over the past 20 years. These findings seem to suggest that malaria infections have increased over the past, a fact that was confirmed by data from two selected health centres in the study area (Sigoti and Sango Rota) between 2011 and 2013. Figure
