<p class="p">A Chi square test revealed that the level of awareness was significantly different across the 11 sub-locations (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 47.31, df = 10, P &lt; 0.0001) despite their almost similar characteristics and proximity to each other. Indeed, the proportion of respondents who were aware of climate change in their area of residence was found to be lowest in Nyong’ong’a sub location as only 66.7 % reported observing changes in climate compared to other sub-locations. Considering the fact that Nyong’ong’a borders the shores of Lake Victoria and is prone to perennial flooding by River Sondu, the findings contradict the general expectation that it would post greater awareness than other sub-location. This could have been due to the inability of the respondents to link extreme weather events such as floods to climate change probably because of their proximity to the lake which is most often associated with a rise in water levels and not floods.
