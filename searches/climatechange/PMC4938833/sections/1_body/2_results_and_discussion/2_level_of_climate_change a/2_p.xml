<p class="p">Consistent with the current study findings, other studies done in and out of Africa such as that of Okonya et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported that nearly all households in agro-ecological zones of Uganda had observed climate change, while Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) found out that farmers in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia were highly aware of climate change. Oruonye (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2011</xref>) also reported that 89.8Â % of students of tertiary institutions in Jalingo Metropolis, Nigeria were aware of climate change, while Juana et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2013</xref>) concluded that climate change awareness is high based on an analysis of empirical studies conducted in Africa. However, all these studies including the current study contradict the earlier conclusions by Pelham (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2009</xref>); GoK (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2010a</xref>) and Mutimba et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>) that climate change awareness levels amongst Kenyans is low.
