<p class="p">Two regions that reported relatively lower level of awareness on climate change were Anding’o Opanga (77.3 %) and Kajimbo sub locations (75 %). However, in five sub-locations (Ramogi, West Kadianga, Upper Kadianga, Lower Kadianga and Gari), all (100 %) the respondents reported having observed some changes in climate in their respective areas. Further statistical analysis revealed that the difference in awareness of climate change across the age groups was not significant (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 4.317, df = 2, P = 0.116). Similar results were observed across gender (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.019, df = 1, P = 0.889) and level of education (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 3.901, df = 4, P = 0.420). However, it was observed that awareness of the households on changes in climate differed significantly across households’ main livelihood (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 18.458, df = 5, P = 0.002). This showed that the type of livelihood practiced by a household had some influence on climate change awareness with crop farmers and livestock keepers showing relatively higher level of awareness compared to traders, fishermen and brick makers.
