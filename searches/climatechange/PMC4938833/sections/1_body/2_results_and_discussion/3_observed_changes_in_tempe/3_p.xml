<p class="p">Based on the total sample, significant differences were observed across the age groups on the level of awareness of changes in temperature (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 25.316, df = 4, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with the middle age group (36–60 years) having observed more of a rise in temperature or no change in temperature while the respondents in the old age (above 60 years) category reported having observed more of a decline in temperature than other age groups. Similarly, significant differences in awareness of changes regarding temperature were observed across the levels of education of the respondents (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 41.708, df = 7, P = 0.011) with a higher proportion of respondents who had attained primary level of education having observed all the changes compared to other levels of education. The relatively high level of awareness on changes in temperature among respondents who had attained primary level of education as compared to other levels of education could be explained by the fact that majority (64.8 %) of the respondents practiced crop farming as their main source of livelihood and were therefore more likely to notice any changes relating to temperature because it is likely to affect their livelihood source directly.
