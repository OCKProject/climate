<p class="p">Most households (87 %) reported rising temperatures over the past 20 years while 4.8 % had observed declining temperatures. However, 8.2 % of the respondents had not observed any changes regarding temperatures in their area of residence. Going by the respondents’ observation on temperature changes in the division over the past 20 years, majority of the respondents were of the opinion that the temperature in their area has risen over that period. This is consistent with climate change projections by the IPCC that East Africa will experience warmer temperatures (Hulme et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2007</xref>). According to UNEP (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2011</xref>) the mean annual temperatures in Kenya had increased by 1 °C between 1960s and 2003 and the observations indicate significantly increasing trends in the frequency of hot days by 15.6 % per year, and much large increasing trends in the frequency of hot nights by 31 % per year. This has led to unpredictability of rains and drought patterns and the subsequent increase in vector borne diseases (Dida et al.
