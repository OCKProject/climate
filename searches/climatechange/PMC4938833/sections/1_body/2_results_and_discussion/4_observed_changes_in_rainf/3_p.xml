<p class="p">Significant differences were observed across the age groups on awareness of changes relating to rainfall patterns (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 41.396, df = 14, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with more respondents in the middle age group (36–60 years) being aware of the changes in rainfall patterns than the youth (30–35 years) and old age (above 60 years). Similar results were observed across gender as more males were aware of declining and late rains than females (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 41.708, df = 7, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), while more female were aware of shorter rain seasons than their male counterparts. The fact that more male tended to identify late rains while more female tended to identify shorter rain seasons may give a glimpse into gender perspective of climate change awareness. Whereas males often involve themselves more with farm preparation and planting, they tended to be more aware of change in onset of rains while women who are often more involved in tending to crops (e.g. weeding) were more observant of the change in length of seasons. Also, significant differences on awareness of the changes in rainfall patterns were observed across the levels of education of respondents (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 71.315, df = 28, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with all the changes observed by respondents who had primary education as opposed to those with university education who only observed declining rains and late rains. As was the case for temperature, most respondents who had attained primary level of education and most of whom were also farmers were likely to observe declining rains as well as late rains. The current study finding is consistent with studies by Brulle et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Hasan and Akhter (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2011</xref>), who reported that those with lower levels of education are likely to perceive climate change as a threat since they rely more on rain fed agriculture and have less income thus remain highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
