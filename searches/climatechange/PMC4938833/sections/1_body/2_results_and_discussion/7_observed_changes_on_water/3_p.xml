<p class="p">The current study finding on observed changes in water sources are consistent with LVBC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>) report which showed that distance to the water sources is increasing for the households in the Lake Victoria Basin (of which the study area is part) and some water sources have been drying up. Also, according to NEMA (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2008</xref>), Mutimba et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>) and GoK (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2010a</xref>) major droughts experienced in the country over the past 50 years have seen severe reduction in the volume of water across the country’s major rivers while the seasonal ones have completely dried up.
