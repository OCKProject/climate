<p class="p">A Chi square test revealed significant differences across the age groups relating to awareness of the changes in water sources (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 31.92, df = 10, P &gt; 0.0001) with the respondents in the middle age being more aware of the changes than the youth and the elderly. This could have been largely due to the fact that the respondents were concentrated around the middle age group. Similar results on the awareness on changes relating to water sources were observed across the livelihood types (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 59.020, df = 25, P &gt; 0.0001) in which livestock farmers and fishermen were most aware of changes in water sources. This could be due to the fact that their livelihoods revolve around the water sources, are therefore more likely to notice any slight changes in water sources. However, no significant difference was observed on awareness on the changes relating to water sources across gender (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 6.04, df = 5, P = 0.302) as was the case across levels of education (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 27.678, df = 20, P = 0.117). These findings however contradicted those of Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Ndambiri et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2012</xref>) in which age, gender and education were reported to have significant effect on climate change awareness.
