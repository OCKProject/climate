<p class="p">Air pollution is an alteration of air quality due to natural or anthropogenic emissions of physical, chemical and biological substances. It’s the environmental factor with the largest impact on respiratory health in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The lung is one of the major sites of interaction with environmental particulates. PM consists of three fractions: a coarse fraction, PM
 <sub class="sub">10-2,5</sub> (2,5-10 μm); a fine fraction PM
 <sub class="sub">2,5-0,1</sub> (2,5-0,1 μm); and ultrafine nanosize fraction, PM
 <sub class="sub">0,1</sub> (≤0,1 μm). The coarse fraction is considered responsible for hazards in the larger airways, whereas PM 
 <sub class="sub">2,5</sub> reaches the gas ex-change region. However only the smallest fraction, the nanosize particles, could penetrate in the alveoli through the air-blood tissue barrier into the capillaries, after being deposited on the alveolar wall. Besides entering tissues and cells in the lung, facilitated by the minute size, these particles may translocate through the blood circulation to all other organs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is this fraction of PM that should be given particular attention as far as adverse health effects are concerned.
