<p class="p">Air pollution can negatively influence lung development in children and adolescents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Most studies suggested the adverse effects of air pollution on children’s lung function and respiratory symptoms. Deficits in lung function were associated with a correlated set of pollutants that included nitrogen dioxide, acid vapor, fine particulate matter (PM
 <sub class="sub">2,5</sub>), and elemental carbon. Deficits in lung function during young adulthood may increase the risk of respiratory conditions, such as episodic wheezing that occurs during a viral infection. However, the largest effects of pollution related deficits might occur later in life, since reduced lung function is a strong risk factor for complications and death during adulthood [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, PM can affect also the cardiovascular system. According to the British Heart Foundation, airborne particulate matter (PM) can increase the risk of CVD in three ways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Firstly, PM can stimulate receptors in the lungs that disrupt the nervous system and cause changes to heart rhythm. Secondly, inhaled particles can cause inflammation of the lungs and then damage the cardiovascular system as inflammatory chemicals pass into the blood. At last, ultrafine particles may pass into the blood and directly affect blood vessels [
