<p class="p">The effect of heat waves on mortality is well documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. It has been observed a rapid rise in the number of hot days and severe meteorological events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] associated with excess deaths across Europe: the 2003 and 2012 heat waves temperatures reached or went beyond 35 °C degrees [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. In Europe, over 70.000 excess deaths were observed in 12 European countries in the heat wave summer of 2003. Summer temperatures as high as those are expected to be the norm by the middle of the century in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. There is evidence of an increased number of deaths and acute morbidity especially among respiratory patients due to heat waves. For each degree Celsius rise in temperature, the risk of premature death among respiratory patients is up to six times higher than in the rest of the population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. The increase in respiratory mortality (relative risk) is larger than the increasing total or cardiovascular mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Moreover, climate scenarios for the next century predict that the warming will be associated with more frequent and more intense heat waves in wide areas of our planet with increased risk of wildfires and desertification. Heat and drought conditions contribute to wildfire risks. Smoke emissions can travel hundreds of kilometers downwind of fire areas, exposing people to a complex mixture of fine particles, ozone precursors, and other health-harming compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. One recent worldwide estimate is that 339,000 deaths annually may be attributable to landscape fire smoke [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions and emergency room visits increase in response to wildfire smoke exposures, strongly associated with PM levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Drought conditions create multiple health challenges: in dry conditions, more pollen, dust, particulates, and when present, wildfire smoke which can irritate respiratory epithelium, exacerbate chronic respiratory illnesses, asthma, and increase risks for acute respiratory infection [
