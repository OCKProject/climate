<p id="Par3" class="p">North American forests have been widely recognized as a growing carbon sink, absorbing a substantial amount of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. Two processes are commonly considered to dictate this growing carbon sink: forest recovery induced by land-use change or disturbances such as agricultural abandonment, reduced harvesting, and fire suppression; and growth trajectory modified by environmental changes such as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and climate change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. These two growth processes could have contrasting implications to the fate of the carbon sink. If forest recovery is the dominant mechanism, then the current carbon sink is expected to saturate as forests age and reach late successional stages. In contrast, if modified growth dominates, then the carbon sink might continue to increase, offering additional potential for carbon sequestration. Previous studies have attributed the North American forest carbon sink to either regrowth, e.g., ref.

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>, with limited consideration of both mechanisms. With rapid changes in land-use and climate in North America and around the world

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>, it is urgently important to have a full understanding of both contributing mechanisms and prediction of the potential of forest biomass as a carbon sink. This understanding can help inform policies on future CO
