<p id="Par4" class="p">Here we compiled a complete set of forest inventory data from North America north of Mexico to understand the fate of forest biomass as a carbon sink and to predict its potential in mitigating climate change. The study of North American forests in depositing carbon is especially critical because they have experienced a history of resiliency and recovery: forests were mostly cleared for agriculture in the early twentieth century, but they since have significantly recovered

 </sup>. The basic model of forest recovery postulates that biomass starts to accumulate with stand age as forests regrow following disturbance, but the trajectory is modified by changes in the environment. The aboveground biomass of a forest observed at a given age is an outcome integrated from both processes. To understand and predict this cumulative effect, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) growth model, assuming that the forest recovery trajectory is described by a growth function, where its parameters are further determined by forest-type and climate. We chose the Monod (Michaelis–Menten) growth function for its simplicity and similar performance among many growth functions (Supplementary Figures

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). For each forest-type, the two Monod parameters, the asymptotic saturated aboveground biomass and the stand age to reach half-saturation, further depend on local climate conditions, with the assumption that the spatial variation in climate distribution can substitute the temporal variation in climate change

 </sup>. Our model is verified and validated by the National Forest Inventory data of 26 yr (1990–2016) and 140,267 plots spanning across the United States and Canada. We began by developing the HB growth model using observations in the current period (2000–2016). We then used the current model to independently hindcast observations in the past period (1990–1999). Finally, we extrapolated our model to predict the forest biomass potential under idealized scenarios in the future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) and quantify the extent to which the current biomass approaches the future biomass potential. We found that climate change effectively modifies the forest recovery trajectory, but the overall forest growth is limited. Under various climate change scenarios, the North American forest biomass will sequester at most 22% more carbon than current levels by the 2080s. The limits to forest growth suggest policy changes to lower future CO
