<p id="Par15" class="p">We assembled forest inventory data from the United States Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program and the Canadian Permanent Sample Plots (PSP) program in six provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec). The FIA program applies a nationally standardized sampling protocol with a sampling intensity of one plot per 2428 ha

 </sup>. FIA inventory plots in forested areas consist of four 7.2 m fixed-radius subplots spaced 36.6 m apart in a triangular arrangement with one subplot in the center. All trees (standing live and dead), with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least 12.7 cm, are inventoried in each subplot. Within each subplot, a 2.07 m radius microplot offset 3.66 m from subplot center is further established where only live trees with a DBH between 2.5 and 12.7 cm are inventoried. All stems are measured and identified to species. For each plot, the age is determined by coring three dominant or co-dominant trees that represent a plurality of non-overtopped trees. The stand age is estimated as the average of these three trees

 </sup>. Each PSP plot was designed as one square or rectangular plot in shape, or consist of four squared subplots. The average PSP plot size is 0.07 ha, ranging from 0.04 to 0.81 ha. All live trees with DBH &gt; 1 cm were measured for most PSP plots, and the live trees with DBH &gt; 5 cm were measured for a small group of PSP plots.
