<p id="Par16" class="p">In this analysis, the FIA and PSP data were extracted from two periods: 2000–2016 (current) and 1990–1999 (past). We used the current period to develop a forest biomass–age relationship and the past period to independently validate this relationship. We excluded plots that reported any natural or human-caused disturbances, such as fire, logging. For the current period, we collected 67,065 FIA plots and 10,342 PSP plots. For the past period, we collected 54,127 FIA plots and 8733 PSP plots. The stand age was directly reported from plot estimates of coring trees. Our assumption was not that forest stands across North America are even-aged; rather we assumed that the age of the dominant or co-dominant trees represents the age of the forest ecosystem. For each plot, the aboveground biomass was estimated using allometric equations from DBH measurements
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> and was summed across all live trees to obtain a live-tree plot biomass
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. We classified these plots into 23 common forest types in North America. For the FIA plots, the forest types were included in the raw data, as derived from the dominant species to reflect the main species composition
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. For the PSP plots, we classified the forest types following a similar approach by assigning the first 1–3 species with the highest percentage in aboveground biomass as the dominant species for each plot, and then we matched the forest types with the FIA classification.
