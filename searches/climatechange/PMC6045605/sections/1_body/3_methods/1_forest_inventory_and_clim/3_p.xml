 </sup>. We used the ensemble projections averaged across the 15 CMIP5 models, under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (low emission) and RCP8.5 (high emission) scenarios, for three future periods: the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. We acknowledged that the FIA plot coordinates have been perturbed in an unbiased direction not exceeding 1.67 km, and typically within a 0.8 km radius of the actual plot location, so as to facilitate study repeatability without introducing bias

 </sup>. However, this perturbation is similar to the spatial resolution of our climate data (1 km). We therefore used the publicly available perturbed plot coordinates to match the forest inventory with climate data.
