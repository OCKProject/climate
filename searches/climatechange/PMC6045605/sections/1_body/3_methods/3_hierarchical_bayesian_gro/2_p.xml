<p id="Par20" class="p">Our road map can be divided into three steps. First, we developed a HB growth model of the forest biomass, stand age, and climate relationship based on forest inventory and climate data in the current period (2000–2016). For each plot, the biomass recovery with stand age was effectively described by a Monod function, where the biomass gradually increases with the age but eventually saturates

 </sup>. The Monod recovery trajectory is further determined by forest types and modified by climate conditions

 </sup>. Second, we validated our model by using the current period to independently hindcast (backward predict) forest biomass in the past period (1990–1999). The model parameters obtained from the current period were used to hindcast the past biomass based on the past stand age and climate. The comparison of hindcast biomass vs. observed biomass provided an additional test of model performance and assumptions. Third, we used the validated model, future stand age, and future climate to predict forest biomass in the future periods of the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. We assumed no major disturbances as the best-case scenario for biomass recovery. Our final step was to compare the current biomass with the predicted future biomass. With this road map, we describe our analysis for the current, past, and future periods.
