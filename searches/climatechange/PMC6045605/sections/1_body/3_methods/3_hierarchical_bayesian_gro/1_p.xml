<p id="Par19" class="p">Our analysis quantifies the forest biomass recovery with stand age, with considerations of climate, in the past, current, and future forests across North America, in a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) framework. Theoretically, the HB framework was motivated by the transient dynamics of terrestrial carbon storage

 </sup>. In a steady state environment, a growth function mathematically describes forest recovery in an autonomous system. When the environmental conditions are undergoing changes, the carbon storage capacity is no longer a constant but becomes a moving attractor, toward which the ecosystem carbon storage trajectory chases. In this non-steady state environment, a hierarchical growth model describes modified forest recovery in a non-autonomous system. A similar HB framework was recently developed to quantify climatic controls of postfire plant regeneration in South Africa
