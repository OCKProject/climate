<p id="Par11" class="p">Our analysis comes with several possible limitations. First, it does not consider environmental change factors other than climate (temperature and precipitation). Changes in atmospheric composition, such as CO

 </sup>. On the one hand, our past and current periods (1990â€“2016) might not be sufficiently long to detect the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and nitrogen fertilization effects. On the other hand, our future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) might have different levels of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and nitrogen deposition than today, and they could affect forest dynamics and biomass. The potential impacts of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and nitrogen fertilization are knowledge gaps that worth further investigation. Another possible factor is growing season length, which might have considerable positive influence on forest growth. Seasonal forest ecosystems might not be sensitive to temperature or precipitation per se, but they might respond to the prolonged growing season, as suggested in studies of accelerated growth
