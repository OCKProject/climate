<p id="Par14" class="p">Based on in-situ observations, our analysis suggests that North America forests, after decades of increasing biomass carbon, might start to experience growth saturation, and their carbon sequestration potential is limited at 22% to the 2080s future. The saturation of forest biomass has been suggested by simulation models
