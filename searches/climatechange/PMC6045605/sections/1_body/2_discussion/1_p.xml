<p id="Par10" class="p">Our findings suggest that North American forests are recovering from previous disturbances with trajectories modified by climate, but the biomass growth potential appears limited. Although the limited growth of forest biomass with age is known in theory

 </sup>, this study uses ground-based measurements to quantify the extent under idealized projected climate change scenarios across continental scales. Verified by the current data and validated by the past observations, our model predicts that the present aboveground biomass is, averaged across all forest types, 78% of its biological capacity in the 2080s future of North America. The future projection assumes the best-case scenario as no further disturbance will reset the successional clock. Clearly, the actual future biomass is likely to be lower than this ideal projection, as additional disturbances reset the ecosystem to earlier successional stages. Given the increasing intensity of disturbances under global change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>, our projections of the biomass ratio are likely to be underestimated. In other words, increased future disturbances might lead to an even smaller biomass carbon sink and a higher ratio than reported here. All these signs point to limits to forest growth and saturation of forest biomass carbon sink across North America. These findings are consistent with other observation-based models in the United States
