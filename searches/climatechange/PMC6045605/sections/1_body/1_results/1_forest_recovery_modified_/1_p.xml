<p id="Par5" class="p">During the current period (2000–2016), our HB growth model successfully explains the large variations in the aboveground biomass across the stand age and geographic gradients of major forest types in North America. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the measured aboveground biomass spanning 30-fold across the 1000 yr gradient of stand ages. Of the 23 forest types, western forests have significantly larger biomass than eastern forests (e.g., redwood vs. loblolly/shortleaf pine). In general, the aboveground biomass accumulates rapidly at young stand age and gradually saturates at later stages. The large variations within each age group and deviations from the monotonically increasing Monod function (e.g., decreasing biomass at some stages in Douglas-fir) suggest local climate effects in modifying the recovery trajectory. Comparing to observations, the model effectively quantifies the recovery trajectory and its uncertainty. The strong spatial correlation (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, spatially modified 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test) between the observed and modeled biomass indicates that the model predicts the biomass well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Forests in the Pacific Northwest have the highest biomass density (&gt;300 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and the southwestern forests, in contrast, have the lowest biomass (&lt;50 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>), with the northeastern forests (150–250 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and the southeast (100–200 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) falling between. Although data from the United States and Canada were retrieved from different sources, they show smooth transitions across the border. Agreements along the stand age gradient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and across North American geography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) both verify the assumptions that biomass recovers with stand age, with trajectory modified by climate. We also performed a spatial cross-validation and found that the observed and predicted biomass are spatially highly correlated (

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test), which provides yet another way to verify the assumptions.
