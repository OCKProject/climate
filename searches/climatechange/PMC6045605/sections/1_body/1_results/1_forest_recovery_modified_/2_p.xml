<p id="Par6" class="p">The forest recovery trajectory is governed by two critical parameters: the asymptotic saturated aboveground biomass and the stand age to reach half-saturation, both of which are assumed to depend on climate. Across forest types, higher temperature generally increases the saturated aboveground biomass but decreases the half-saturation stand age; more abundant precipitation increases both the saturated biomass and half-saturation age. The estimated model parameters quantify the saturated biomass and half-saturation age on average climates, as well as various climate effects on them (Supplementary Table
