<p id="Par7" class="p">As in many forest succession studies, our analysis is based on the approach assuming the variation in biomass over time (age) could be approximated by the variation across space, e.g., ref.

 </sup> The space-for-time assumption is widely applied but rarely tested. To validate this assumption, we used the model fitted to the current observations to independently hindcast (backward predict) the observed biomass in the past period (1990–1999). With a decade apart from the current period, the past period provides supplementary information on stand age distributions over forest successional dynamics (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The additional test shows that the past observed aboveground biomass is well hindcasted by the models across forest types (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>) and that the observed and hindcasted biomass are spatially strongly correlated (Supplementary Figure
