<p id="Par8" class="p">Based on the validated results for current and past observations, we extrapolated the model of aboveground biomass into the future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s). As a starting point to anticipate climate change, we aimed to quantify the potential of biomass carbon sequestration under best-case scenarios. With this goal, we assumed no major shift in forest-type composition and no further disturbance, such as fire or insect outbreak. We considered the projected change in climate, because they could modify forest recovery trajectories. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the current period (observed and modeled), in reference to the future periods under two climate change scenarios (low emission RCP4.5 and high emission RCP8.5). Biomass increases from the observed 89.9 ± 65.6 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (mean ± standard deviation) or modeled 91.2 ± 55.5 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> in 2000–2016 (current), to 105 ± 63.8 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (RCP4.5) or 105 ± 63.9 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (RCP8.5) in the 2020s, to 127 ± 77.4 Mg ha

 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (RCP4.5) or 148 ± 99 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> (RCP8.5) in the 2080s. Geographically, the biomass accumulation is dominated by the continued recovery of the eastern forests, supplemented by the northwestern forests (Supplementary Figure
