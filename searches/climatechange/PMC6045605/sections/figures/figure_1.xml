  <p class="p">Forest aboveground biomass current recovery with stand age across forest-type. Observed and modeled aboveground biomass and stand age in 23 primary forest types across North America are summarized for the current period, 2000â€“2016. Observed values (gray boxplots) are collected from the National Forest Inventory programs in the United States and Canada. Modeled values (red lines and ribbons) are calculated as the posterior means (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) from the hierarchical Bayesian growth model fitted to the current data. Each forest-type is fitted to the model separately</p>
