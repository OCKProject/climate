<p class="p">In 2012, WHO estimated 7 million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the worldâ€™s largest single environmental health risk. It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps.</p>
