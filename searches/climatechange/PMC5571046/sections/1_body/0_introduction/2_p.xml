 <italic class="italic">Salvelinus fontinalis</italic> infested with gill lice 
 <italic class="italic">Salmincola edwardsii</italic>, and was inversely correlated with extent of secondary bacterial infection, a measure of fish health

 </sup>. Thus, infections have the potential to synergistically interact with ectotherm physiology to reduce warming tolerance, which could render individuals and populations more vulnerable to rising temperatures from climate change or habitat modification. However, the effect of fungal infection on host thermal limits has not been tested and the influence of infections on host thermal limits has rarely been investigated in the context of realistic, fluctuating thermal acclimation regimes.
