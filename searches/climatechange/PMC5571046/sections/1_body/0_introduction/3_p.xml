 </sup>. We experimentally infected frogs with Bd and acclimated them to constant cool temperatures or daily heat pulses mimicking the body temperature regimes of frogs in nature. We then examined the effects of Bd infection status, infection intensity and acclimation on their critical thermal maxima and considered the implications of our findings in light of current and projected global change.
