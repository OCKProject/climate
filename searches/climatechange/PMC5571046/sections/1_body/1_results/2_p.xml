<p id="Par6" class="p">The magnitude of the effect of infection status on temperature at loss of righting ability depended on acclimation to heat pulses (p = 0.014; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>); compared to uninfected individuals, the temperature at loss of righting for infected individuals under constant acclimation regimes was reduced by an average of up to 2.7 °C, whereas the temperature at loss of righting for infected individuals under pulsed acclimation regimes was only reduced by an average of up to 1 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A similar pattern emerged for the magnitude of the effect of infection status on temperature at onset of spasms, although this was not statistically significant. Specifically, the temperature at onset of spasms for infected individuals under constant acclimation regimes was reduced by an average of up to 3.9 °C, whereas the temperature at onset of spasms for infected individuals under pulsed acclimation regimes was only reduced by an average of up to 2.7 °C (Table
