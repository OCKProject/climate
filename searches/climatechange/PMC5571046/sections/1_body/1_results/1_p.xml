<p id="Par5" class="p">The critical thermal maxima of our model frog species 
 <italic class="italic">Litoria spenceri</italic>, measured as temperature at onset of spasms and temperature at loss of righting ability, were significantly lower for Bd-infected frogs than for uninfected frogs (spasms: p &lt; 0.001; righting: p = 0.009; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), after controlling for a positive relationship between frog snout-urostyle length and critical thermal maxima (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Across acclimation temperature treatments, mean temperature at onset of spasms ( ± SD) ranged from 34.2 °C ± 2.1 °C to 35.6 °C ± 3.1 °C in infected frogs and 36.2 °C ± 1.4 °C to 38.5 °C ± 1.2 °C in uninfected frogs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Likewise, mean temperature at loss of righting ability ranged from 37.4 °C ± 2.2 °C to 39.9 °C ± 1.3 °C in infected frogs and 39.6 °C ± 0.5 °C to 40.5 °C ± 1.0 °C in uninfected frogs (Table
