<p id="Par7" class="p">Infection intensity at the time of CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> measurement varied widely among temperature treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). By day 36, the day that we measured CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in six of the most highly infected frogs from each temperature treatment, the mean infection load exceeded our established threshold for disease development (13,700 ZGE) in all treatments except the low elevation heat pulse treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). After day 36, all frogs from both high elevation treatments and the low elevation constant treatment eventually exceeded the threshold infection intensity. In contrast, only one frog from the low elevation heat pulse treatment exceeded the threshold infection intensity after day 36; the other 10 of 17 frogs in this treatment (59%) maintained low infection loads, eventually cleared their infections, and were therefore excluded from the study. Although infection status had a significant effect on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, we were unable to detect a statistically significant effect of infection intensity on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, low elevation heat pulse was the only treatment in which (1) the negative effect of infection on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was greatly reduced (standard errors of mean CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> temperatures for infected and uninfected frogs overlap (Fig 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and (
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) the average infection loads on day 36 and for the entire duration of the experiment did not exceed the threshold level of 13,700 ZGE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
