<p id="Par25" class="p">Our goal was to measure CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> when frogs had well-developed infections but before they displayed clinical signs of infection. By day 36, infection loads in most inoculated frogs were relatively high; in an effort to avoid morbidity and mortality from infection, we measured CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> for a subset of inoculated frogs (n = 6 of the most heavily infected frogs in each acclimation temperature treatment) as well as for all control frogs (n = 5 per temperature treatment) on day 36. We then determined relative risk of morbidity and mortality using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for a concurrent experiment with the same cohort of

 </sup>. This analysis indicated that frogs with infection loads &gt;13,700 ZGE had a 63% chance of dying or showing signs of chytridiomycosis. Subsequently, we measured CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> for the remaining inoculated frogs gradually over time, as swab results indicated that frogs were approaching or had exceeded the threshold infection intensity of 13,700 ZGE. We measured CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> within 48 hours of swabbing. All frogs were processed by day 56 except for 10 frogs from the low elevation heat pulse treatment that were excluded from analyses because they never reached the threshold infection intensity and eventually cleared their infections, possibly due to their temperature treatments. All inoculated frogs had sub-clinical Bd infections when we measured CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>.
