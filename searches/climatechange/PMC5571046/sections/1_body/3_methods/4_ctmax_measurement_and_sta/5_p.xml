 </sup>. We used analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs; Anova function in car package; Fox and Weisberg 2011) to test for effects of Bd infection status (infected or uninfected), elevation (high [15 °C] vs. low [18 °C] acclimation treatments), heat exposure (pulse [26 °C or 29 °C] vs. constant acclimation treatments) and interactions between infection status and acclimation on our metrics of CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, with snout-urostyle length as a covariate (n = 69; α = 0.05). To determine whether infection intensity might affect thermal tolerance, we performed separate ANCOVAs using data for infected frogs only, with log-transformed ZGE values as the infection variable (n = 39; α = 0.05).
