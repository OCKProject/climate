 </sup>. Onset of spasms, when frogs began displaying erratic movements such as increased jumping and leg twitches, was the first sign of thermal discomfort. We considered this metric to be a conservative estimate of the temperature at which a frog will seek refuge from high temperatures in the wild. After onset of spasms, at each 1 °C increase in chamber temperature, we quickly opened the chamber, gently moved the container until the frog jumped, and closed the chamber. Loss of righting ability, an animal’s upper heat threshold, was determined when animals were unable to right themselves for three seconds after this manipulation. To minimize stress to the frogs, we elected to record the ambient (i.e., thermocouple) temperature at each behavioral indicator of CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> for each frog. Frogs were then immediately placed in room-temperature water to recuperate (all frogs survived). After a recovery period following CT
