<p id="Par19" class="p">To obtain zoospores for inoculations, we inoculated Petri dishes containing TGhL broth in 1% agar with ~1/3 ml of cultured broth. Plates were partially dried in a laminar flow cabinet, incubated at 21 °C for four days, and then maintained alternatingly at 4 °C and 21 °C to sustain growth and zoospore production. For each inoculation, we added up to 4 ml of deionized (DI) water to the dishes to form a zoospore suspension. We then combined the liquid contents of each dish, calculated the concentration of zoospores with a hemocytometer (Neubauer Improved Bright-line), and added DI water to produce a final concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> zoospores per ml. We prepared a sham (control) inoculant by following the same protocol but with Petri dishes containing only nutrient agar.
