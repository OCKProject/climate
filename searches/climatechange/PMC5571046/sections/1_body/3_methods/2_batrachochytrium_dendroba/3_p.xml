We experimentally infected captive-reared (sourced from a captive breeding facility at the Amphibian Research Centre, Victoria, Australia), juvenile

 </sup>. Experimental Bd inoculations often yield infection rates &lt; 100% and infection levels are commonly quite variable over time. We therefore used a lower number of sham-inoculated control animals (n = 5 per treatment) than Bd-inoculated treatment animals (n = 10–17 per treatment) to maximize our samples of infected individuals and capture natural variability in infection levels.
