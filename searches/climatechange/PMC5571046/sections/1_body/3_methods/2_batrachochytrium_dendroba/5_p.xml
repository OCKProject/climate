 </sup> on the day after the last inoculation. Six replicate chambers were programmed to execute each of the four acclimation temperature treatments. The chambers were arranged in a blocked design, such that there were six spatial blocks, each containing one chamber following each of the four temperature treatments. The location of each temperature treatment within each block was determined randomly. We distributed inoculated and control frogs into the chambers as evenly as possible and reduced effects of frog history and body size by assigning frogs to temperature treatments proportionally by clutch of origin (reported by captive breeding facility) and snout-urostyle length (measured prior to inoculation). We systematically rotated the placement of the frog enclosures within each chamber every other day to ensure that they were evenly exposed to any local differences in temperature that might exist within the chamber.
