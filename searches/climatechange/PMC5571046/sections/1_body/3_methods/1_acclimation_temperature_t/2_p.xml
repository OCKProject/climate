<p id="Par17" class="p">Thus, our two high elevation treatments were (1) a daily rectangular wave with trough at 15 °C for 20 h per day and crest at 26 °C for four hours per day (hereafter high elevation heat pulse; inoculated: n = 11; control: n = 5) and (2) a constant 15 °C control treatment (hereafter high elevation constant; inoculated: n = 11; control: n = 5; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Our two low elevation treatments were (1) a daily rectangular wave with trough at 18 °C for 20 hours per day and crest at 29 °C for four hours per day (hereafter low elevation heat pulse; inoculated: n = 17; control: n = 5) and (2) a constant 18 °C control treatment (hereafter low elevation constant; inoculated: n = 10; control: n = 5; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The constant temperature control treatments (15 °C and 18 °C) served as a standard against which to observe effects of acclimation to realistic heat pulses on host thermal tolerance. Our temperature treatments are also pertinent to Bd physiology as this fungus shows optimal short-term growth at 15–25 °C, and ceases growth and reproduction at 26–29 °C
