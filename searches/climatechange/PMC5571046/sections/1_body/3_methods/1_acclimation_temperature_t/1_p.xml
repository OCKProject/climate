  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. The radio-transmitters recorded frog body temperatures every 15 min for 5–11 d. We created simplified, rectangular-wave acclimation temperature treatments to approximate the patterns we found in the field data. We derived the trough temperatures of the rectangular wave treatments from the overall medians of individual median body temperatures at the two high elevation sites (750–800 m elevation; 15 °C) and two low elevation sites (20–100 m elevation; 18 °C) where tracking occurred
