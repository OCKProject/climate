<p id="Par13" class="p">We observed higher upper thermal tolerances in infected frogs that were acclimated to realistic daily heat pulses than in infected frogs that were acclimated to constant cool temperatures. These results highlight the importance of incorporating biologically meaningful acclimation temperature regimes into the design of experiments and support the recent finding that small-bodied hosts may be more capable of temperature acclimation than previously thought (Rohr 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., in review). Whereas Rohr 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (in review) found that the magnitude of acclimation plasticity may be underestimated in laboratory experiments due to its dependence on acclimation duration and body mass, our use of an atypically long acclimation duration (â‰¥36 days) and small-bodied hosts suggests that our study is robust to these common experimental artifacts. Importantly, however, under most of our acclimation treatments, the magnitude of the parasitism effect exceeded the magnitude of the acclimation effect. This suggests that for populations of some species, even as thermal tolerances are adjusted to long-term increases in temperature from climate change, any benefit this provides to warming tolerance may not be sufficient to protect animals from the thermal consequences of parasitism.
