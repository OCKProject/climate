<p id="Par12" class="p">In contrast to heavy infections, mild infections may not significantly lower host thermal tolerance. The low elevation heat pulse treatment was the only group in which (1) most individuals had infection loads below the threshold for disease development, and (2) the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of infected and uninfected individuals was similar, suggesting that any effects of light infection levels on the thermal tolerance of frogs were minimal. However, this warrants further study, especially because we did not detect a statistically significant effect of infection intensity on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (TableÂ
