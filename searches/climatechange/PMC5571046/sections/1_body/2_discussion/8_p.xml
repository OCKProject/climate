<p id="Par15" class="p">While gradual increases in average temperatures could favor the hosts of some parasites, such as cool-loving fungi, our study illustrates that we may currently be unable to predict the combined effects of infections and climate change on host populations. Of particular concern are unpredictable heat waves that are long enough to impose thermal stress on hosts but are too short to be therapeutic, for example by ridding hosts of heat-intolerant parasites, or to allow for thermal acclimation. We conclude that infectious disease could lead to increased uncertainty in estimates of speciesâ€™ vulnerability to climate change.</p>
