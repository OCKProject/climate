<p id="Par9" class="p">The thermal safety margins of organisms may be compressed not only by rises in environmental temperatures but also reductions in maximum heat tolerance. In our study, heavy fungal infections lowered the critical thermal maxima of juvenile frogs by up to ~4 °C. The maximum heat tolerance of organisms can be determined by temperature effects on the molecules, cells, and biochemical reactions of organ systems, including the circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems

 </sup>. The temperature resistance of these systems could plausibly decrease if already weakened by Bd infection or stress, especially since Bd causes tissue damage
