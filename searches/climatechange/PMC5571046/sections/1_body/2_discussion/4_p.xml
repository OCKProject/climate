<p id="Par11" class="p">In ectothermic hosts, including frogs, behaviors that elevate body temperature may decrease heat-intolerant parasite performance or increase immune function, thereby reducing infection risk or the intensity of existing infections

 </sup>. Our study demonstrates the infection-limiting benefits of thermoregulation – for most frogs, four hours of daily exposure to 29 °C (in our low elevation heat pulse treatment) was sufficient to prevent infection levels from exceeding the threshold marking increased risk for morbidity and/or mortality from infection. A recently proposed conceptual model that expands on the relationship between CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and infection risk predicts that infection risk will increase as the difference between the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of the host and parasite decreases (tolerance mismatch hypothesis; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup> because infection risk is higher when the host occupies microenvironments that are also favorable for the parasite. Species’ CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> are highly variable even within genera and can be overestimated using laboratory techniques

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> spectrum
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup>, our study suggests that in ecological systems in which tolerance mismatch is precariously small, high parasite burdens can shrink the gap between host and pathogen thermal tolerances even further (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), potentially discouraging protective thermoregulatory behaviors, even at temperatures below upper maxima, and tipping the balance in favor of the parasite.
