<p id="Par14" class="p">In contrast to infected frogs, which exhibited enhanced thermal tolerances when acclimated to daily heat pulses, we did not detect this acclimation effect in uninfected frogs (i.e., uninfected frogs exhibited similar [or lower, in the case of onset of spasms in the low elevation heat pulse treatment] thermal tolerances when exposed to daily heat pulses compared to constant cool temperatures). It is unclear why the temperature at onset of spasms was reduced in uninfected frogs from the low elevation heat pulse treatment. Lack of an acclimation effect in the other paired constant temperature vs. heat pulse treatments could be attributed to inherent physiological limits (i.e., a ceiling effect) on thermal tolerance or tradeoffs between thermal tolerance and acclimation plasticity
