<p class="p">An increased frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and periods of drought are important consequences of ongoing climate change (Battisti &amp; Naylor,

 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Our results indicate that this may have important consequences for extant biodiversity, as simulated heat waves and drought stress generally increased mortality rates during early development, as would be expected. Our data also stress the importance of considering detrimental effects of drought when trying to forecast species responses. Importantly, we found that closely related species, arguably differing in their vulnerability to climate change, seem to differ in their responses to environmental stress. However, such variation was restricted to early developmental stages, while different levels of stress seem to have little effect on fitness during further development (i.e., in older larvae, pupae, and adults; Potter et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). We suggest that, in the three species investigated here, stress tolerance during early development might be a major determinant of vulnerability to climate change and may explain recent population declines in

 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). These findings, if similar patterns were found in a larger array of species, may have important implications for enhancing our abilities to predict the fate of particular species and populations under ongoing climate change. For instance, it might be worth comparing models that do or do not consider differences in thermal tolerance across life stages, or models could be improved by integrating results from the arguably most sensitive stage. Recent studies on a tropical butterfly also indicated that the egg stage comprises the most vulnerable developmental stage, that body mass may be a crucial constraint on stress tolerance, and that stress experienced early in life could affect later life stages (Klockmann, Kleinschmidt, &amp; Fischer,

 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Further progress regarding specific traits underlying vulnerability to climate change will likely be achieved by collating more data on stress tolerance throughout development from a broader range of taxa.
