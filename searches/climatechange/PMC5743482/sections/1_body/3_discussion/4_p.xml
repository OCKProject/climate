<p class="p">In contrast to the above results on egg mortality, the respective interaction between species and treatment was not significant for hatchling mortality, although the pattern obtained was very similar (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33588-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). These results may suggest that vulnerability to stress decreases during development, which is in line with an earlier study on the same species as investigated here, in which we found that differences in vulnerability to climate change are unlikely to be caused by differential responses to thermal and desiccation stress during (later) larval and pupal development (Klockmann, Karajoli, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) or in the adult stage (Klockmann, Wallmeyer, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Thus, in the species considered here, the early developmental stage, especially the egg stage, seems to be the most critical life stage determining vulnerability to climate change.
