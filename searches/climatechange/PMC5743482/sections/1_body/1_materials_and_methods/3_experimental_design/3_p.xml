<p class="p">In the second experiment, we investigated effects of heat and food stress on hatchling mortality. We used a food stress rather than a desiccation treatment here for ecological reasons. While eggs certainly suffer from low humidity, larvae may not as they are able to obtain water from plant material. We therefore decided to manipulate plant quality rather than humidity. Hatchlings were placed 2 days after hatching, separated by female for

Again, three treatments were used: (i) control (provided with fresh cuttings under control conditions), (ii) heat (provided with fresh cuttings and exposed for 2 days to a simulated heat wave), and (iii) food stress (provided with wilted leaves to mimic the results of a period of drought for 2 days under control conditions). Control and heat conditions were identical to the first experiment (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33588-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). To produce wilted leaves, leaves were cut off the plant and stored for 24 hr at 20°C and 50% r.h. in a climate cabinet without water supply. This handling resulted in levels of host plant wilting frequently experienced in the natural habitats of the species. All animals remained under control conditions before and after the treatments. The mortality rate per box was scored as percent on day 6 of larval development.
