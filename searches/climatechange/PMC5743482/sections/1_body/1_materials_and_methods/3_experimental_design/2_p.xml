<p class="p">We investigated egg and hatchling mortality with the eggs obtained using a split‐brood design for 
 <italic class="italic">L. tityrus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. dispar</italic>, while for 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic> eggs were randomly divided into groups. In the first experiment, we investigated the effects of heat and desiccation stress on egg mortality. Both stresses seem to be ecologically relevant in the egg stage. For testing, eggs were placed 2 days after laying into glass vials in groups of 10, using 9–20 replicates per treatment and population. Replicates consisted of random larvae in 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic> and full siblings in 
 <italic class="italic">Lycaena tityrus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. dispar</italic>. The three treatments used involved a (i) control, (ii) a heat (including an exposure for 2 days to a simulated heat wave), and a (iii) desiccation treatment, in which eggs were placed for 2 hr on two consecutive days into a box containing silica gel with a relative humidity of 10% to mimic a period of drought (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33588-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The temperature cycles used are based on field data obtained in larval habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic> within the Westerwald mountain range in the years 2011 and 2013, where 
 <italic class="italic">L. tityrus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic> naturally occur (Limberg &amp; Fischer, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, we used a temperature cycle typical of average conditions in June (i.e., within larval period) as control and the data of a particularly hot June day to simulate a heat wave (Limberg &amp; Fischer, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although the humidity chosen is very low, note the short exposure time mimicking conditions that may occur, for instance, during spells of direct sun exposure. Our field data obtained from larval habitats confirm that such low humidities are ecologically relevant. The absolute minimum relative humidity within larval habitats, based on 39 locations, was on average 6.1 ± 0.2% (Limberg &amp; Fischer, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Similar experimental setups have been repeatedly used before to assess desiccation resistance (Gomez, Sambucetti, Loeschcke, &amp; Norry, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Pichrtová, Kulichová, &amp; Holzinger, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Tejeda et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Except from exposure to heat waves or low humidity, all eggs were kept under control conditions. Egg hatching success per glass vial (10 eggs) was scored under control conditions as percent.
