<p class="p">We analyzed mortality rates (percentage of dead individuals per box; starting with 10 individuals per box) for eggs and hatchlings using hierarchical general linear mixed models (GLMMs) with treatment and species as fixed categorical effects, and population and group (either family or random group in 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic>) as random categorical effects. Population was nested within species, and group was nested within species and population. Note that we used replicated populations for each species. The effect of replicate population was modeled as random effect in order to account for the variance explained by differences among populations rather than species. Group was modeled as random effect to account for the nonindependency of siblings, as a split‐brood design was used for two of the three species (see above) such that per female one group of offspring was allocated to each treatment. Separate analyses were run for eggs and hatchlings due to differences in the treatments used. Data were analyzed using Statistica 8.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Pair‐wise comparisons after GLMMs were performed employing Tukey's HSD for unequal sample sizes. Throughout the text, means are given ±1
