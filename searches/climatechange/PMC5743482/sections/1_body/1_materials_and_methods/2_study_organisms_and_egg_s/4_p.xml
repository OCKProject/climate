 <xref rid="ece33588-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) is a boreal butterfly with 1–2 generations per year, ranging from central Europe, where it is a postglacial relict species, to Scandinavia and Northern Asia (Ebert &amp; Rennwald, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). It is a hygrophilous butterfly colonizing mires, swampy grassland, and moist meadows (Ebert &amp; Rennwald, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Fischer, Beinlich, &amp; Plachter, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The only larval food plant in central Europe is 
 <italic class="italic">B. officinalis</italic> (Fischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The species is declining in large parts of its range (Van Swaay &amp; Warren, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), is listed in the EU Habitat Directive, and is considered endangered in the Red List of Germany (Binot‐Hafke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Because of the strong population declines and its specialized habitat requirements, being confined to moist and cool stands, we consider the species’ vulnerability to climate change as being high (Habel et al. 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Mated females were caught in two populations in May 2014 in Belgium, vicinity of Baraque de Fraiture (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10; N:50°13′; E:14°15′), and in Germany, vicinity of Liebenscheid (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10; N:50°40′; E:8°04′), and were transferred to Greifswald University for egg‐laying. Butterflies were kept for egg‐laying as outlined above with the following exceptions. For oviposition, females were placed groupwise into translucent 20‐L plastic box and provided with 
 <italic class="italic">B. officinalis</italic>. Keeping females individually resulted in very low egg numbers, which would have been insufficient for subsequent experiments.
