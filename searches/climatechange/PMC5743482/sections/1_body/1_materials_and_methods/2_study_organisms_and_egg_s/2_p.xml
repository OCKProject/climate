<p class="p">To investigate vulnerability to climate change, we used three species of Copper butterflies (
 <italic class="italic">Lycaena</italic> spp.; cf. Klockmann, Karajoli, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The Sooty Copper 
 <italic class="italic">L. tityrus</italic> (Poda, 1761) is a widespread temperate‐zone butterfly, ranging from western Europe to central Asia (Ebert &amp; Rennwald, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). The species has 1–3 generations per year and inhabits a variety of biotopes like grassland, sandy heathland, bogs, and open woodland (Brunzel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The principal larval host plant is 
 <italic class="italic">Rumex acetosa</italic> L., but some congeneric plant species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">R. acetosella</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">R. scutatus</italic> L.) are utilized as well (Ebert &amp; Rennwald, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Tolman &amp; Lewington, 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). This species is not listed in the EU Habitat Directive and is considered least concern in the Red List of Germany (Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Binot‐Hafke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33588-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Lycaena tityrus</italic> has recently colonized previously unoccupied mountain ranges in central Europe and is expanding its range northward in northeastern Europe (Brunzel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Settele et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33588-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Because of these range expansions and its ability to inhabit even dry and hot habitats, the species is expected to benefit from climate change and its according vulnerability is consequently considered to be low. Mated females were caught in two bivoltine German populations in July 2014 in the vicinity of Ueckermünde (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 10; N:53°44′; E:14°15′) and Greifswald (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 12; N:54°2′; E:13°26′), and were transferred to Greifswald University for egg‐laying. Butterflies were kept in a climate cabinet (Sanyo MLR‐351H; Bad Nenndorf, Germany) under naturally fluctuating temperatures to improve ecological realism (i.e., control conditions: mean 19.4°C, 75% relative humidity, and L17:D7 photoperiod; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33588-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For oviposition, females were placed individually in translucent 1‐L plastic pots and were provided with 
 <italic class="italic">R. acetosa</italic> for egg‐laying and with fresh flowers (
 <italic class="italic">Crepis</italic> sp. L.
 <italic class="italic">, Achillea millefolium</italic> L.
 <italic class="italic">, Bistorta officinalis</italic> Delarbre
 <italic class="italic">, Leucanthemum vulgare</italic> LAM.), water, and a 20 vol% sucrose solution for adult feeding. Eggs were collected daily and transferred, separated by female, to small glass vials and kept under egg‐laying conditions until allocation to treatment groups.
