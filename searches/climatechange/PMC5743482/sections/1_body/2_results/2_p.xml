<p class="p">Average mortality rates of eggs varied significantly across treatments, being lowest under control conditions (14.2 ± 1.9%) followed by the heat (28.8 ± 1.9%) and finally the desiccation treatment (38.8 ± 1.9%; control &lt; heat &lt; desiccation, Tukey's HSD; Table

 <italic class="italic">L. tityrus</italic>: 29.0 ± 1.9%; 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic>: 30.7 ± 2.0%). However, species differed in their responses to different levels of stress in egg mortality (significant species by treatment interaction). Egg mortality rate increased most strongly between control and heat/desiccation stress in 
 <italic class="italic">L. helle</italic> (by 25.0 and 31.0 percentage points for the heat and desiccation treatment, respectively), but weaker in 
 <italic class="italic">L. dispar</italic> (11.6 and 25.9 percentage points) and especially in 
 <italic class="italic">L. tityrus</italic> (7.8 and 15.6 percentage points). Mortality rates differed significantly among populations and groups.
