<p class="p">The spatial distribution of average light suitability index of the potato during the whole growth season showed a pattern of high values in the north and low values in the south, as well as high values in the western inland region and low values in the eastern monsoon region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Areas with high light suitability were mainly concentrated in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and central and western Inner Mongolia. Perennial light time was more than 70% of the illumination time, especially in some areas such as Aletai (1.000), Hami (1.000), Tacheng (1.000) in Xinjiang, Wuchuan (0.968) in Inner Mongolia, and Zhangye (0.971) in Gansu. The low light suitability areas were mainly concentrated in Gansu, southern Qinghai and northeast China, including Tongwei (0.241), Jingchuan (0.383), and Dandong (0.442). These areas were characterized by more clouds, more precipitation and less light. The light suitability index in other area was almost 0.800, which was suitable for potato growth.
