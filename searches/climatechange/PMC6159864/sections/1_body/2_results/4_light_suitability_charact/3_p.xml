<p class="p">The average light suitability index of potato increased over each growth stage. Over the past 50 years, the average light suitability index during the sowing-emergence stage increased from 0.757 to 0.821. During the emergence-flowering stage and the flowering-maturity stage, the average light suitability index increased from 0.790 to 0.805 and from 0.650 to 0.676, respectively. These results showed that light suitability in most areas of northern China was high overall and could meet the light demands of the potato, which was beneficial to potato cultivation, development and production. Moreover, the geographic range of the suitable planting region expanded over the past 50 years.</p>
