 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The areas with the highest values of precipitation suitability were mainly concentrated in Changchun (0.746) in Jinlin, Horqin (0.687) in Inner Mongolia and Tongwei (0.645) in Gansu. The precipitation suitability index was approximately 0.500 in some regions including Shanxi, Shaanxi, western Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning, all of which were found in the generally suitable region. Conversely, most areas of Xinjiang and Qinghai showed low precipitation suitability, including Hami (0.044), Golmud (0.115), and Hotan (0.262).
