<p class="p">In summary, these results showed that the precipitation suitability of potato in most areas was generally low. Over the past 50 years, the precipitation suitability index of potato in this area overall decreased. Moreover, the precipitation suitability index of potato during each growth period displayed a downward trend, especially during the flowering-maturity stage. Because the flowering-maturity stage was related to the further development and tuber expansion of the potato, this downward trend would have direct adverse effects on potato yield. Based on these results, precipitation remained the main climatic factor restricting potato growth in northern China.</p>
