<p class="p">In general, the spatial distribution of the average temperature suitability index of potato during the whole growth season for 1965â€“2014 showed a gradually declining trend from the eastern region to the western region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The areas with the highest values of temperature suitability were mainly concentrated in Baiquan (0.955) in Heilongjiang, Changchun (0.910) in Jilin, Wuchuan (0.970) and Tuquan (0.940) in Inner Mongolia, Datong (0.950) in Shanxi, Zhangbei (0.907) in Hebei, Tongwei (0.982), Tacheng (0.916) and Aletai (0.945) in northwestern Xinjiang. Conversely, the temperature suitability index was low in most areas of Qinghai and Xinjiang, particularly in NangQian (0.672) and Hetian (0.624), due to the large daily temperature range.
