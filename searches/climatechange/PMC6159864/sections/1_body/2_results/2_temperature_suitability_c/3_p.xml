<p class="p">As far as the growth stage of potato was concerned, the average temperature suitability varied during the different potato growth stages from 1965 to 2014. During the sowing-emergence stage, the average temperature suitability index increased slightly, fluctuating between 0.886 and 0.901. During the emergence-flowering stage, the average temperature suitability index decreased from 0.937 to 0.909, but maintained a relatively high value. During the flowering-maturity stage, the average temperature suitability index was mostly stable between 0.800 and 0.805. In summary, the temperature in most areas of northern China could effectively meet the demands of potato growth, and was suitable over the past 50 years.</p>
