<p class="p">Variations in climatic regionalization of potato planting in northern China were compared during the first twenty-five years (1965–1989) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref> and the last twenty-five years (1990–2014) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>. The impact of climate change on different regions varied. For northeast China, climate change was very beneficial to local potato cultivation over the past 50 years, because of the expanded highly suitable areas for potato growth. For north China, the highly suitable areas receded and were replaced by moderately suitable areas. However, in northwest China, the potato planting was the most negatively affected by climate change. Especially, in the southern region of northwest China, the moderately suitable areas receded and were replaced by generally suitable areas. Meanwhile, in the western region of northwest China, the highly suitable areas receded and the low suitable areas expanded.
