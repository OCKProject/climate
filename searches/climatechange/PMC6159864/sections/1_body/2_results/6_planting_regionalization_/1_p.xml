<p class="p">Average climatic regionalization of potato planting in northern China was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203538.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>. The highly suitable areas were mainly distributed in central Inner Mongolia, northwestern Hebei and the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China. The average temperature during the potato growth season in this region was 18°C-20°C. Annual precipitation was approximately 400 mm-600 mm. These areas were cool, humid, and at a moderate altitude, which were advantageous for potato production. Consequently, these areas not only produced high-quality and high-yield potato crops but also a high commodity rate and high input-output ratio.
