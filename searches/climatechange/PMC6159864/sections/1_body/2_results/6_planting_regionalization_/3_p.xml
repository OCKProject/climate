<p class="p">The generally suitable areas were mainly distributed in eastern Qinghai and eastern and southern Xinjiang. This area was located in the warm temperate zone, with adequate light and heat but scarce precipitation. The climate was hot in summer and cold in winter, with annual precipitation of approximately 200 mm. Temperatures fluctuated widely from day to day. The climate varied by region due to the complex topography. Large-scale potato cultivation was not seen in this region because of the numerous constraints to potato growth, though some climate conditions feasible for potato planting were found.</p>
