 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] developed an assessment method based on agro-climatic indicators calculated over phenological periods (eco-climatic indicators) for crop climate suitability. He et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] used a temperature thermal response coefficient model to calculate a temperature suitability value for potato phenology, conducting precise temporal and spatial evaluations on temperature suitability for potato growth in China. Nguyen et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] developed a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis procedure to evaluatethe suitability of temperature and precipitation for the winter wheat and summer maize cropping systems in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, China. In China, the impacts of climate change on potato over the past few decades have been a major cause of concern [

 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] found global climate warming had caused adverse effects on potato yield in semi-arid regions of northwest China from 1961 to 2010 based on WOFOST crop model. Zhao et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] adopted the first difference method to disentangle the contributions of climate change to potato yield in northern China. They concluded that the potato yield in this area was the most sensitive to variation of the diurnal temperature range followed by radiation, precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration. However, the above research mainly focuses on the relationship between climate change and potato yield at a small scale. To date, the impacts of climate change on potato suitability and planting regionalization in northern China at a regional scale have not been thoroughly evaluated. Understanding how different climate factors interact and impact potato suitability and regionalization is essential when making decisions on how to adapt to the effects of climate change.
