<p class="p">The potato (

 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Northern China is the largest potato-producing region in China, with approximately 49% of the country’s planting area. This region has become China’s primary producer of seed potatoes and processed potatoes. Potato is sensitive to changes in major environmental factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and its yield is influenced by light, temperature and water [
 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, northern China is hindered by relatively fragile ecosystems and poor agricultural technology, making it sensitive to climate change and directly affecting potato yield and quality. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of potato climatic suitability and the variations in planting regionalization for potato in northern China is an effective approach to climate change adaptation and provides an opportunity to ensure regional food security.
