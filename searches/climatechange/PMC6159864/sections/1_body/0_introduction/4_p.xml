<p class="p">The objectives of the present study are to: (1) understand characteristics of temperature suitability, precipitation suitability and light suitability in northern China during each potato growth stage using robust observational evidence based on the agricultural climatic suitability theory and the fuzzy mathematics method; (2) explore the effects of climatic variables on comprehensive potato suitability using long-term datasets; (3) quantitatively evaluate the variations in planting regionalization of potato in northern China from 1965 to 2014. These findings are significant for substantially improving our understanding of crop suitability in response to climate change on a regional scale in China.</p>
