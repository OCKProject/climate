<p class="p">Despite these shortcomings, these results do offer a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of climate change on potato suitability and planting regionalization in northern China at the regional scale. The variations in climatic suitability and planting regionalization for potato in northern China over the past 50 years have been quantitatively evaluated in our study. In order to improve farming management and invest in more facilities in practice, a subsequent study is necessary to explore the distribution pattern of climatic suitability for the potato in future climate scenarios in northern China.</p>
