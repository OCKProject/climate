<p class="p">It was generally found to be true that increasing temperature induced by climate warming tended to increase the developmental rate of crop and extend the length of growing season. In this study, we found the average temperature in northern China increased significantly from 17.52 in 1965 to 18.51 in 2014. This would result in a positive impact on potato production at higher latitude seven in the absence of improvements in cultivars, cultivation, and management [

However, when current temperatures approach the upper limits of the optimal temperature range for potato growth, higher temperatures will not only detrimentally affect vine and root growth but also might cause a delay in tuber initiation and consequently a reduction in final potato yield [

In this study, we found the annual precipitation in northern China decreased during the period of 1965â€“2014 and fluctuated greatly in the interannual range. Decreased precipitation in many areas was predicted to increase the need for irrigation of potato crops [

In general, potatoes are long-day plants, strongly relying on light which affects not only growth but also assimilation and distribution. In this study, we found the sunshine hours in northern China from 1965 to 2014 decreased from 8.67 hours in 1965 to 7.33 hours in 2014, which might be related to the decreasing sunny days[
