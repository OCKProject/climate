<p class="p">Generally speaking, the relationship between crop and climate is mainly reflected by the response of crops to climate and the suitability of crops to climate. Suitability not only reflects the anastomosis of crops in a certain climate, including growth and development, yield level and distribution, but also shows the advantages and disadvantages and degree of resources provided by the environment for crops. Light, heat and water resources are the three most basic elements of agricultural climatic resources. They provide crops with essential materials and energy for growth. All the factors of agricultural climatic resources have a certain suitable range for the growth of crops. The method of fuzzy mathematics can be used to define the suitability of agricultural climatic resources for the growth and development of crops to [0 and 1] interval. 0 of them indicates that the climate is completely unsuitable for the growth and development of crops, and 1 indicates that the climate is the most suitable for the growth and development of crops. The other is a continuous transition state [
