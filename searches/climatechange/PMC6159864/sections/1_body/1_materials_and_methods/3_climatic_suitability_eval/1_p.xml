<p class="p">The relationship and the degree of coordination between climate and crops often need to be described in a quantitative form. An evaluation model of crop climatic suitability can be developed for the growth of crops based on crop climatic resources, revealing the intrinsic link between climate and some crops. This can further explain the benefits and restrictions to crop growth and regional distribution in different climates, providing an important theoretical basis for the improvement of technology, management and allocation of agricultural production resources. In this study, the agricultural climatic suitability theory [

 <xref rid="pone.0203538.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] were applied. Potato growth season in northern China was divided into 3 stages: from sowing to emergence, from emergence to flowering and from flowering to maturity. The climatic suitability evaluation of the potato included four parts: temperature suitability, precipitation suitability, light suitability and comprehensive climatic suitability.
