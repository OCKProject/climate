<p class="p">In this study, the weight 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> was determined by the correlation coefficient method. The process of determining the weight using the correlation coefficient method was as follows: first, the correlation coefficient matrix among temperature, precipitation or light and per unit potato yield for given growth stages (from sowing to emergence, from emergence to flowering and from flowering to maturity) from 1965 to 2014 was determined; second, the average correlation coefficient between a main climatic factor (temperature, precipitation or light) suitability index and per unit potato yield during the whole growth stage was calculated; finally, the weight values were determined according to the proportion of average correlation coefficient between a climatic factor suitability index and per unit potato yield during the whole growth stage, and the correlation coefficient sum between all climatic factors suitability index and per unit potato yield. Key climate factor weights during the different potato growing stage in northern China were presented in
