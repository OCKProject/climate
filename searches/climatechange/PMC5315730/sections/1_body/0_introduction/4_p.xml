<p class="p">The number of studies dedicated to the impact of climate change on water quality in catchments is limited in comparison with studies focusing on the relation between climate change and quantitative aspects of catchment hydrology. There have been few studies dedicated to the impact of climate change on various water quality aspects (e.g., Murdoch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2000</xref>; Van Bokhoven 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2006</xref>; van Vliet and Zwolsman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2008</xref>; Whitehead et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2009</xref>). For example, Van Bokhoven (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2006</xref>) projected the water quality of the Rhine River to deteriorate as a consequence of the increased occurrence of hydrological extremes (i.e., droughts and floods). During floods, increases in heavy metal concentrations due to desorption or re-suspension are projected, while during droughts increases in eutrophication and heavy metal concentrations due to a decrease in dilution may be expected.
