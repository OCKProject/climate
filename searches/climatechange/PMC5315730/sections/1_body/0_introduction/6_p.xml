<p class="p">The aim of this study is to quantify the impacts of future climate change on the transport of heavy metals (i.e., Cd and Zn) from soils to surface waters in contaminated lowland catchments. For this, we selected the Dommel catchment, in the border region of the Netherlands and Belgium, which has been contaminated by metal inputs from zinc smelters, as a case study area. A conceptual semi-distributed hydrological model was forced with future projections derived from the KNMIâ€™14 climate change scenarios (KNMI
