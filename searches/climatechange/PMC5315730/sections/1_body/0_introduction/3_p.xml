<p class="p">Future climate change is hypothesized to affect the hydrology of catchments (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2013</xref>). It is likely that evapotranspiration will increase due to atmospheric warming, and in addition, there is medium confidence that heavy precipitation events will become more frequent and intense over many areas of the globe towards the end of the twenty-first century (Seneviratne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2012</xref>). These changes may affect the relative proportions of quick- and baseflow towards surface waters and, hence, the transport rates and pathways of heavy metals (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2003</xref>; Middelkoop 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2008</xref>). For example, intensification of precipitation may result in larger proportions of quickflow, which could accelerate the leaching of heavy metals to surface waters.
