<p class="p">Studies on the effects of climate change on heavy metal transport are even sparser. Visser et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2012</xref>) assessed the effects of future climate change on the hydrology and leaching of Cd and Zn in the Keersop catchment, a lowland catchment located in the south of the Netherlands. At the end of the twenty-first century, lower concentrations of Cd and Zn were projected as a result of lower discharge and lower water levels caused by higher evapotranspiration rates and an associated slowing down of groundwater flow. On the other hand, Joris et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2014</xref>) showed that climate change results in an increase in the cumulative Cd leaching flux to groundwater in the nearby Kempen area in the Dutch-Belgian border region compared to a no-climate-change reference scenario. These seemingly contrasting results demonstrate that the effects of climate change on the transport of heavy metals in catchments is multifaceted, complex, and equivocal, and requires a thorough understanding of the hydrological dynamics and pathways.
