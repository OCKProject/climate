<p class="p">The WALRUS model was calibrated using time series of daily-observed discharge obtained from the Bossche Broek gauging station (unpublished data, provided by the Dommel Water Authority) (see location G1, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This time series includes measured daily discharges for the period January 2000–February 2015, but contains some data gaps primarily in the periods June–November 2002 and February–October 2003.
