<p class="p">WALRUS was calibrated using automatic calibration under a cross-validation approach. The initial parameter values and parameter ranges were based on previously reported parameter values (Brauer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014b</xref>) and an a priori model sensitivity analysis. The values and ranges are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The cross-validation approach consisted of a calibration and validation for the periods 2000–2006 and 2005–2010, using time series of daily-observed discharge from six gauging stations (unpublished data, provided by the Dommel Water Authority) (see locations G1–G6, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) across the Dutch part of the Dommel catchment. The observed discharges at each gauging station were weighted against their upstream areas. The first year of these periods was used as spinning-up period. Several model efficiency criteria were used to test the model’s performance. The best performing parameter set was eventually used for current and future simulations. The automatic calibration was conducted using Parameter ESTimation (PEST) algorithms (Doherty, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>). In total, two PEST runs were conducted for each calibration period. Between the two PEST runs, water balances were closed to optimize the model performance. Water balances were closed by calculating the mean daily difference between observed and simulated discharge values for the calibration periods 2000–2006 and 2005–2010. The mean daily difference was used as an external flux in WALRUS, representing upward/downward seepage (Brauer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014a</xref>).
