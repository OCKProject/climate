<p class="p">Since it was impossible to identify the model separately for each subcatchment (i.e., 44 × 5 = 220 parameters), a parameter regularization method was needed. To this end, the aforementioned calibration parameters—with the exception of

  <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 </sub> and

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">G</italic>
 </sub> were coupled to two soil texture classes: sandy and loamy soils. Sandy soils advance quickly to new storage deficit equilibria and are characterized by low flow resistance, short vadose zone relaxation times, and small groundwater reservoir constants. To run the WALRUS model, an area-averaged parameter value was calculated for each parameter and for each subcatchment.
