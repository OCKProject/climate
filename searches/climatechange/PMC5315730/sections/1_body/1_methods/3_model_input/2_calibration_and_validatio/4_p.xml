<p class="p">To evaluate the outcomes of the metal transport model, simulated flux-weighted concentrations in the discharged runoff were compared with the medians and means of observed Cd and Zn concentrations in the Dommel River. To this end, observations of the period 2001–2010 were used for nine different measurement locations (unpublished data, provided by the Dommel Water Authority) (see locations M1–M9, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) that are located in the Dommel River. Since external fluxes from Belgium were not taken into account, boundary conditions were imposed for the Dutch-Belgian border. For the boundary conditions in the main branch of the Dommel river at the Dutch-Belgian border, a bias-corrected (Ferguson,

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and simulated discharge values was established. The estimated metal concentrations were multiplied by the simulated discharge to obtain the metal loads at the Dutch-Belgian border. For the other border-crossing rivers, no measurements were available. For these rivers, boundary conditions were imposed by using simulated quick- and baseflow metal concentrations from the first Dutch subcatchments, located directly downstream of the Belgian subcatchments. These metal concentrations were used to estimate the total loads that are transferred to the Belgian part of the river network.
