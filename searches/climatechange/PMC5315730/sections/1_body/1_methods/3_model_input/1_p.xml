<p class="p">The meteorological forcing of the WALRUS model consisted of daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration time series. The daily precipitation time series involved time series of precipitation averages for each subcatchment respectively, which were estimated from gridded (1 × 1 km

The reference evapotranspiration was extracted from the Eindhoven meteorological station for the period 2000–2010. Land use information was derived from the CORINE land cover dataset (Bossard et al.
