<p class="p">The effects of climate change on Cd and Zn transport in the Dommel catchment were investigated by using a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model coupled to a metal transport model. The model system was set up in the PCRaster–Python environment (Karssenberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2010</xref>) with a spatial schematization of 250 × 250 m
