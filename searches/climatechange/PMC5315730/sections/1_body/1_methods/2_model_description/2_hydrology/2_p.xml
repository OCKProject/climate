<p class="p">For large-sized catchments, such as the Dommel catchment, the application of WALRUS as a single model entity is not cumbersome due to the heterogeneous catchment characteristics (e.g., soil and drainage density) and the inability to account for the delay and attenuation of flood waves in the channels. For this reason, WALRUS was implemented and applied in a semi-distributed way, which was achieved in two steps:
