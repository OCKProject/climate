<p class="p">The SOM contents and DOC concentrations in the topsoil layer under present conditions and the climate scenarios were derived from the spatial implementation of the soil organic matter Century model (Metherell et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2016</xref>; Van der Perk et al. submitted). The SOM contents and the other soil physicochemical parameters for the deeper soil layers, except DOC, were obtained from the STONE database (Van Bakel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2008</xref>). DOC leaching through the successive soil layers was simulated using the soil water flux as modeled by the Century model. The biodegradation of the rapidly and slowly degradable DOC pools during downward transport was simulated using the double-exponential model reported by Kalbitz et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2003</xref>). The distribution of DOC across the two pools and their associated degradation rates for the various land use classes were also obtained from Kalbitz et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2003</xref>). The water residence time in the soil layers was calculated using the soil water fluxes and water content at field capacity, which was estimated based on the particle size distribution, SOM content, and soil bulk density using the empirical relations reported by Gupta and Larson (
