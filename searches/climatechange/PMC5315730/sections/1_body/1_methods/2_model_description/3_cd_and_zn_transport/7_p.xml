<p class="p">Like DOC, the leaching of Cd and Zn to groundwater was simulated using the water fluxes from the Century model. In each soil layer, the solid-solution partitioning was updated using the above empirical relations between the dissolved metal concentrations and the reactive metal concentrations. The metal concentrations in the leachate were calculated from the mean concentrations for the depth interval between average lowest and highest groundwater levels.</p>
