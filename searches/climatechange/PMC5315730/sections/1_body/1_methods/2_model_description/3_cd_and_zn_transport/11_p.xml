<p class="p">The metal loads in the quickflow and baseflow were calculated as the product of their respective concentrations and water fluxes as simulated by the WALRUS model. The sum of the metal loads from quickflow and baseflow were transferred to the nearest river network grid cell. The calculated loads and discharge fluxes as simulated by WALRUS were accumulated over the river network and divided by each other to obtain the mean flux-weighted metal concentrations in the groundwater discharged to surface waters in the Dutch part of the Dommel catchment. These flux-weighted concentrations may differ from the actual metal concentrations in the river network since the model calculations do not take the in-channel attenuation of metals, e.g., due to adsorption to bed sediments, into account. In-channel metal attenuation involves many complex hydrological and biogeochemical processes, which are controlled by highly dynamic factors, such as pH, suspended sediment concentration, and bed sediment composition and redox conditions. Metal attenuation was disregarded from the model primarily because of the lack of data about these factors, which is needed to appropriately simulate these processes.</p>
