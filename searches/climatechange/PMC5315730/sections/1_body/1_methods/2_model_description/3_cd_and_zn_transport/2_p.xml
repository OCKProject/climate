<p class="p">For the estimation of the metal loading to the river network via quickflow and baseflow, the historic development of the topsoil Cd and Zn concentrations was first estimated. For this, we used maps Cd and Zn concentration in the topsoil for the year 1995 (Van der Perk et al. The response of metal leaching from soils on climate change and land management in a temperate lowland catchment, submitted), which were previously created by combining and interpolating Cd and Zn concentration measurements from various databases. The accumulation of Cd and Zn in the topsoil between the start of the operation of the zinc-ore smelters in 1880 and 1974 was interpolated using the atmospheric and agricultural Cd and Zn loads to soil as reported by Bonten et al. (

For the 1975â€“1995 period, the decline in Cd and Zn contents in the topsoil was modeled according to the metal leaching rates as simulated by Van der Perk et al. (submitted). This yielded annual values for the total Cd and Zn concentrations in the topsoil.
