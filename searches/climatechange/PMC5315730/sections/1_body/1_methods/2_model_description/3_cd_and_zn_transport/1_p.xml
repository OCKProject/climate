<p class="p">A metal transport model was set up to simulate the transfer of Cd and Zn to the river network for the Dutch part of the Dommel catchment solely. In the Belgian part, the leaching and transfer of Cd and Zn was not simulated due to low data availability. The modeling approach comprised three steps: (1) the estimation of the loading towards the river network via quickflow, (2) the estimation of the loading towards the river network via baseflow, and (3) the estimation of mean flux-weighted concentrations in the runoff water discharged in the river network, based on the loading estimated in the former two steps.</p>
