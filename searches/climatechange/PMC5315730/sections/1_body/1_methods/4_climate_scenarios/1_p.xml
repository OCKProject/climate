<p class="p">To assess the potential impacts of climate change on metal transport towards surface waters, the hydrology and metal transport were simulated for the periods 2000–2010 (“baseline”) and 2090–2099 (“future”). To simulate future impacts, the WALRUS and Century models were fed with three scenarios: NoCC (i.e., no climate change, based on the current meteorological forcing) and the KNMI’14 climate change scenarios G

 <sub class="sub">H</sub> (KNMI 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015a</xref>). The latter scenarios contain projected changes in climate variables (e.g., precipitation) for two different time horizons, 2050 (2036–2065) and 2085 (2071–2100), and are based on the global climate models as used for the 5th IPCC Assessment report (IPCC
