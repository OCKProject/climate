<p class="p">This study focuses on the catchment of the Dommel River (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The main reason for choosing the Dommel catchment as study area is the severely contaminated state of the Kempen area, which encompasses roughly the southern half of the catchment in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the period 1880–1974, four zinc-ore smelters (three in Belgium, one in the Netherlands) emitted large amounts of heavy metals, such as Cd and Zn. Atmospheric deposition resulted in high and widespread accumulation of these metals in the upper soil layers surrounding the smelters (Van der Grift and Griffioen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>). In addition, ore slags from these smelters were used to pave roads and gardens, resulting in leaching of Cd and Zn from these roads to groundwater (Copius Peereboom-Stegeman and Peereboom

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>). After 1974, atmospheric emissions have decreased drastically due to modifications in the production schemes of the ore smelters. Nevertheless, current Cd and Zn concentrations in upper soils are still high, threatening the quality of the terrestrial and aquatic environment (Van der Grift and Griffioen
