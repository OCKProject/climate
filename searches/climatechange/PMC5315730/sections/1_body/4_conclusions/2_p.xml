<p class="p">The outcomes indicate that Cd and Zn loads to surface waters and mean flux-weighted concentrations in the discharge runoff will increase towards the end of the twenty-first century as a result of breakthrough of Cd and Zn in the soil system. Hence, relative changes in daily Cd and Zn loads are expected with relative increases up to 820 and 570%, respectively. Relative changes in Cd and Zn flux-weighted concentrations are in the order of 40 and 50%, respectively. Future climate change is expected to result in increased discharge in winter and decreasing discharge during summer. These changes result eventually in the acceleration of leaching, leading to higher Cd and Zn loads. As a result of climate change, flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations increase during early summer and decrease during late summer and early autumn under the most extreme climate scenario. The latter is likely the result of large variability in precipitation and the associated contribution of the quick runoff components to the total runoff during these months.</p>
