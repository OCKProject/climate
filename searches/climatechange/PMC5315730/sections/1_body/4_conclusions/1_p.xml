<p class="p">A semi-distributed hydrological model and a metal transport model were applied to the Dommel catchment to investigate the impact of climate change on future hydrological fluxes and related metal transport pathways in lowland catchments. The hydrological and soil organic matter models, which were implemented in the metal transport model, were forced with future climate change projections.</p>
