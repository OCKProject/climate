<p class="p">Future increases in loads and concentrations as a result of changing climate conditions are large compared to current conditions, but limited to the expected changes under NoCC-climate conditions. This indicates that climate change is only a small accelerating factor in the leaching of heavy metals from soil systems. It is likely that concentrations and loads will increase further in the twenty-second century. This can be explained by the combination of projected decreases in Cd and Zn leaching from the topsoil (Van der Perk et al. submitted), and increasing Cd and Zn concentrations in baseflow due to breakthrough of heavy metals. This means that the bulk of heavy metals will still be present in the soil system at the end of the twenty-first century. The combination of expected impacts of climate change on leaching and transport of heavy metals and increasing leaching rates as a result of breakthrough will eventually affect human health and ecosystems. According to European water quality standards, the annual average Cd and Zn concentrations are not allowed to exceed 0.08 and 200 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively (Overheid 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2016</xref>). This means that the current period Cd concentrations at the outlet of the Dommel catchment (i.e., at measurement location M1) are already far above water quality standards with observed and simulated median flux-weighted Cd concentrations of 0.4 and 1.2 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. Our results suggest that future Zn concentrations in surface waters will exceed the quality standards as well.
