<p class="p">The simulated current and projected future metal loads and concentrations of our study are generally in line with previous studies in the same region, although details may differ. Van der Grift and Griffioen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2008</xref>) simulated Cd concentrations in the Beekloop-Keersop catchment, a small subcatchment in the southern part of the Dommel catchment. They simulated concentrations between 3 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2000 and 5 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2010, which are similar to the flux-weighted Cd concentrations of 4.6 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (period 2007–2009) simulated in this study for measurement location M9 (i.e., close to the Beekloop-Keersop catchment; see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Our simulated concentrations are also in the range of those reported in the study of Bonten et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>). Bonten et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>) simulated daily Cd concentrations of less than 2 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for the period 1993–2001) and daily Zn concentrations of less than 200 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (for the period 1989–2001) at the outlet of the Dommel catchment during most of the days. We simulated a median Cd concentration of 1.2 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (period 2001–2007) and a median flux-weighted Zn concentration of 134.6 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (period 2001–2007) for the same location (measurement location M1; see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
