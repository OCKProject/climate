<p class="p">Our results show that future climate change will increase the Cd and Zn loadings towards surface waters. This finding is in line with the study by Joris et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2014</xref>), who projected increases of 10% in cumulative Cd leaching from the unsaturated zone in the southern part of the Dommel catchment. Nevertheless, future changes differ from those projected in other studies. Visser et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2012</xref>) projected decreases in Cd and Zn concentrations in the Keersop catchment. These changes were accompanied with decreases in Cd concentrations during winter period from 0.6–0.8 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under current conditions to 0.2–0.4 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under climate change and decreases in Zn concentrations from 30–50 to 20–40 μg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under the same conditions. In the summer period, the changes are relatively small due to small concentrations already present in surface waters under current and future climate conditions. The different trends among the different studies can mainly be explained by the different climate input. For instance, Visser et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2012</xref>) projects decreases in discharge and groundwater drainage, meaning less leaching will appear. Joris et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2014</xref>) projects increases in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which results in higher groundwater levels and thus in higher leaching rates.
