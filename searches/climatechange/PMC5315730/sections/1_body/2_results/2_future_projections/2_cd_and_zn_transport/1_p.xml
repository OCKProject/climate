 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c–f</xref> shows the mean transported Cd and Zn loads towards the river network under NoCC- and W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate conditions. Under NoCC-climate conditions, the largest increases in Cd loads (up to 710%) are simulated in the southernmost part and southeastern part of the model area (i.e., region surrounding a Zn smelter where highest metal concentrations in the topsoil are present) with increases from 0.5–1.0 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 1.0–2.0 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or higher (up to 11.4 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) relative to baseline climate conditions. The largest Zn load increases (up to 500%) are simulated for the southeastern, southernmost, northernmost, and western parts of the area with increases from 50–150 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 150–200 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or higher (up to 1100 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Since hydrological fluxes do not change under NoCC-climate conditions compared to baseline climate conditions, the enhanced loads can be explained by increasing concentrations in the quick- and baseflow components due to a breakthrough of Cd and Zn from the soil system. Hence, the highest increases in quickflow concentrations are generally projected for the western and southeastern parts of the area with Cd increases from 0.8–1.0 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> to 6–10 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> and Zn increases from 100–600 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> to 750–1750 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>. The highest increases in baseflow concentrations are generally projected for the northern, north-central, western, and southeastern parts of the area with Cd increases from 0.6–1.2 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> to 4.5–6.0 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> and Zn increases from 150–250 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> to 300–500 mg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>. The magnitude of concentrations in the different flow components indicates that it is likely that quickflow is the largest contributor of Cd and Zn under NoCC-climate conditions. Under the W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate scenario, the highest Cd and Zn load increases are projected for the same regions as under NoCC-climate conditions. Nevertheless, in comparison with NoCC-climate conditions, relative changes are slightly larger (i.e., up to 820% for Cd and up to 570% for Zn), and loadings are higher (i.e., up to 12.1 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for Cd and up to 1210 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). This can be mainly attributed to changes in quick- and baseflow. Quickflow is expected to increase in both quickflow- and baseflow-dominated areas (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>), whereas relative changes in baseflow vary per subcatchment. For instance, in the southwestern part of the Dommel catchment, baseflow is expected to decrease with 6% under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate conditions, whereas baseflow is expected to increase with 6 and 1% in the southern and southeastern parts of the Dommel catchment, respectively (i.e., where highest Cd and Zn loads increases are projected). Whether quick- or baseflow solely or a combination of these contributors are responsible for load enhancements differs per region. For instance, in the western part of the model area, where the highest increases in quick- and baseflow concentrations are projected under NoCC-climate conditions, both quick- and baseflow increase. This indicates that increases in quick- and baseflow are responsible for the enhancements. In the southern part of the model area, likewise increases in quick- and baseflow are projected. However, the quickflow appears in such small amounts that baseflow can be seen as the only contributor of Cd and Zn. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this part of the area, an acceleration of leaching from groundwater is the main mechanism responsible for the load enhancements.
