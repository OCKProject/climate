 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the projected changes in monthly averaged flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations in the discharged runoff as simulated for the outlet of the catchment (i.e., measurement location, M1). The flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations are projected to increase in the future under all climate scenarios. The projected monthly average Cd and Zn concentrations in the period 2090–2099 are significantly higher than the current baseline concentrations (two-sample paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). A two-sample heteroscedastic 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test showed that the difference is significant for most of the months (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> generally below 0.001), except for the concentrations for September and October under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate conditions. The average difference between monthly average Cd and Zn concentrations under G
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate conditions and NoCC-climate conditions is significantly different from zero (two-sample paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), whereas the average difference between monthly average Cd and Zn concentrations under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>-climate conditions and NoCC-climate conditions does not significantly differ from zero. The monthly average concentrations under a G
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate do not significantly differ from those under the NoCC scenario, except for the Cd concentrations in February (two-sample paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.04). The monthly average concentrations under a W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate are only significantly different from those under a NoCC climate during the months January, February, March, and June (and December only for Zn) (two-sample heteroscedastic 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05). Compared to the NoCC climate, the lower monthly average metal concentrations in the period August–October under a W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate are likely to be the result of large variability in precipitation and the associated contribution from quickflow during these months.
