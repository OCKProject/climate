<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> summarizes the relative changes in the annual hydrological fluxes under G
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> and W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate scenarios for the quickflow- and baseflow-dominated areas in the downstream and upstream parts, respectively, of the Dommel catchment. On an annual basis, both discharge and quickflow are projected to increase under both scenarios and in both areas. The relative changes in baseflow differ between the areas but show similarities between the scenarios. In the downstream area, baseflow is expected to increase by 3% under G
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate conditions and by 4% under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate conditions. This indicates that in the quickflow-dominated areas, more groundwater drainage is expected to occur towards the end of the twenty-first century. The projected increase in baseflow is mainly the result of increased precipitation, which is generally greater than the increase in potential evapotranspiration (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In the upstream area, the changes in baseflow are expected to be limited with relative decreases of 1% under both climate scenarios. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows the projected changes in discharge, quickflow, and baseflow on a monthly basis for quickflow- and baseflow-dominated areas. During winter, all the hydrological fluxes are projected to increase. Hence, the largest changes in discharge, quickflow (for quickflow-dominated areas), and baseflow (for baseflow-dominated areas) are projected under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate conditions. During summer, all fluxes are projected to decrease with the largest decreases under W
 <sub class="sub">H</sub> climate conditions. The contribution of baseflow in quickflow-dominated areas is, however, expected to remain limited. The projected changes during winter and summer are mainly related to precipitation increases during the winter period and precipitation decreases during the summer period (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
