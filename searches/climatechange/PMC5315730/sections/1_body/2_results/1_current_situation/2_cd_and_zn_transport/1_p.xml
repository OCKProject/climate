 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> lists the median and mean values of the simulated flux-weighted and observed Cd and Zn concentrations at nine measurement locations in the Dommel River (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The simulated flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations are generally higher than the observed Cd and Zn concentrations. Both the observed and simulated concentrations show a clear negative gradient between upstream and downstream stations, which can be explained by dilution of Cd and Zn during transport through the river network. The simulated flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations are higher than the observed Cd and Zn concentrations. For both metals, the overestimation by the model increases more or less consistently from a factor of about 1.2 at the upstream measurement location (M9) to about 3.0 for the most downstream measurement location (M1). This overestimation is most likely due to the fact that in-channel attenuation of metals was not taken into account in the model calculation.
