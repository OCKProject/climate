 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the mean contribution of Cd and Zn loads in quick- and baseflow to the simulated total area-specific Cd and Zn loads for the downstream and upstream parts of the Dommel catchment for the period 2001–2010. In the downstream part of the catchment, the contribution of the area-specific Cd and Zn loads is dominated by quickflow and baseflow has only a small contribution to the total loads. The highest area-specific Cd and Zn loads occur in the winter period (i.e., up to about 1.6 and 250 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively) and the lowest (i.e., up to about 0.4 and 70 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively) during the summer period. In the upstream part of the catchment, the contributions of Cd and Zn loads are dominated by baseflow, whereas the contribution from quickflow to total loads is small. In this part of the catchment, the highest Cd and Zn loads also occur in the winter period with area-specific loads up to about 1.4 and 250 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. In the summer period, the area-specific loads are lowest with values up to about 0.2 and 30 μg m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
