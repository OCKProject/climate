 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a and b</xref> shows the mean transported area-specific Cd and Zn loads towards the river network in a baseline climate (2001–2010). Cd loads towards the river network are generally highest in the southeastern and north-central part of the Dommel catchment with loads of 2.0 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or higher (up to 5.7 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). A similar pattern was found for the Zn loads with values of 200 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or higher (up to 600 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The high Cd and Zn loads in the southeastern and north-central parts of the Dommel catchment can be mainly attributed to a combination of prevailing quickflow conditions in these areas (i.e., 53% or higher) and high concentrations of Cd and Zn in the fast runoff component, which are primarily derived from inputs from the zinc-ore smelters located in the southeast and the agricultural inputs of Cd and Zn.
