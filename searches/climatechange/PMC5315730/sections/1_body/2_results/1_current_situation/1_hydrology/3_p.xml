<p class="p">The best performing calibrated parameter set for the period 2000–2006 was used to simulate current and future discharge. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the daily simulated and observed discharge time series at the Bossche Broek gauging station for the period 2001–2010, as simulated with this parameter set. As mentioned before, the simulated discharge is underestimated during dry periods. Further, simulated discharge is overestimated during peak flows in some periods, whereas in other periods simulated discharge is slightly underestimated or similar with observed peak flows.
