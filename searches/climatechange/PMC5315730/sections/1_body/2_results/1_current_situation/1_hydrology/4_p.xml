<p class="p">Based on the hydrological simulations, the Dommel catchment can be subdivided into two regions: quickflow-dominated (i.e., where the fraction of quickflow in the total flux to surface waters is higher than 50%) subcatchments (33 subcatchments) and baseflow-dominated subcatchments (11 subcatchments). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> shows the area-averaged annual sums of hydrological fluxes for quickflow- and baseflow-dominated areas under baseline climate conditions. The quickflow-dominated areas are mainly located in the downstream, lower part of the Dommel catchment, whereas the baseflow-dominated areas are generally located in the upstream, higher part of the Dommel catchment. This upstream-downstream division can be explained by the distribution of wet and dry areas in the catchment. In the downstream part of the catchment, relatively more wet floodplains and marshes are present. These wet areas are characterized by high wetness parameters and low quickflow reservoir constants (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), which causes that most precipitation is directed to quickflow reservoirs. In contrast, the southern, upstream part of the catchment is drier and the contribution of precipitation to the quickflow reservoir is lower. This means that precipitation is mainly directed to the soil-groundwater reservoir, resulting in a larger contribution of baseflow to surface waters.
