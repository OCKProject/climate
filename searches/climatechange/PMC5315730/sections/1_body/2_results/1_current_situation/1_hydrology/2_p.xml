 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> lists the results of the calibration and validation. The model efficiency criteria show consistently better model performances for the period 2000–2006. This can be explained by a combination of missing observation data in the period 2000–2006 during dry periods and an underestimation of simulated discharge during dry periods in the period 2001–2010 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Since missing data have not been included in the estimation of model efficiencies, this eventually results in better model performances for the period 2000–2006. A possible explanation for the underestimation of simulated discharge during dry periods is that the discharge in the Dommel River is artificially supplied with water from the Meuse River via the Zuid-Willemsvaart, Wilhelmina, Beatrix, and Eindhoven canals (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) during dry periods (Vroege and Hoijtink
