<p id="Par11" class="p">The Jiangjialiang excavations revealed nine square, semi-subterranean houses, marking it as a later settlement site than Cishan-Peiligang related sites with round houses. From 21 residue samples collected from three querns and two mullers found in a house, we recovered 13 starch grains from Triticeae alongside 104 starch grains from Paniceae (likely millets). The Paniceae starches make up 81.3% of the entire assemblage, and they are found in all samples at both sites, indicating widespread consumption. In contrast, the percentage of starches from the Triticeae is 10.2%. Triticeae are only found in 20–30% of the samples from both sites (Tables
