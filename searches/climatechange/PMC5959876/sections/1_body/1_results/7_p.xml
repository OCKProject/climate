<p id="Par12" class="p">The final three sites date 6500–5500 cal BP and belong to the Hongshan Culture in Northeast China, known for its jade production, ceremonial sites, and more complex social organization than Cishan. The sites—Jian’gou (43°10′33.2″N, 118°40′55.7″E), Luojiayingzi (42°49′42.9″N,118°30′10.0″E), and Sanjianfang (42°38′12.7″N, 119°41′03.5″E)—are generally located within a similar environment to the other sites, with millet cultivated here since the Xinglongwa Culture, ca. 8300 cal BP, with more domesticated millet macro-remains appearing by 7650 cal BP
