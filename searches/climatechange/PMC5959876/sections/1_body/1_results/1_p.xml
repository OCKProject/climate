<p id="Par6" class="p">The oldest starch remains were observed on the earliest grinding slabs excavated in China, at the earliest-known microblade industry sites, at Longwangchan (Shaanxi) and Shizitan (Shanxi), located on the Loess Plateau along the middle Yellow River valley (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The economies of these Late Paleolithic sites feature the collecting of wild plants and hunting by mobile foraging groups

 </sup>. We collected seven residue samples from the surface of a grinding slab recovered from Layer 5 (~26/25,000 cal BP) at Locality 1 of Longwangchan (36°09′45″N, 110°26′15″E)

 </sup> and recovered 60 starch granules. Of them, 46 starch granules, or 76.7% of the total assemblage (and seen in all samples), are identified as derived from grasses of the tribe Paniceae, and 9 starch granules (15%) of the tribe Triticeae (recovered from five samples) (Table
