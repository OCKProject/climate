<p id="Par10" class="p">Sedentism marks a major turning point in the domestication process, as it gives rise to the earliest permanent villages and ceremonial centers and new requirements for local food production. The settlements feature planting and storage of wild millets and the earliest morphologically domesticated plants. This phase is represented by the North China Plain sites of Cishan (36°34′31″N, 114°06′43″E) and Jiangjialiang (40°11′38″N, 117°17′53″E). Cishan is an eight hectare site, culturally related to a number of village sites of the Cishan-Peiligang-Houli culture sphere on the lowland plains and dry grasslands of the middle and lower Yellow River catchment, perhaps dating ~8000–7500 cal BP

 </sup>. Excavations at Cishan uncovered the remains of temporary rounded-oval huts with grinding stones numbering more than those in domestic contexts in contemporaneous settlements. 474 storage pits (of depths up to 5 m) contained large quantities of millet remains. All the finds demonstrate the ceremonial nature of this locality. The estimated 50,000 kg of stored millet shows that systematic farming was probably well established by this time
