Preserved macro-remains from mid-Holocene sites show agricultural production featuring greater reliance on domesticated broomcorn and foxtail millets. The decrease in Triticeae, shown clearly by starches, occurs as the millet agricultural systems develop associated with the rise of permanent settlements, social ranking, and more developed ritual complexes that are emerging out of increasing Neolithic cultural elaboration that begins with the Peiligang-Cishan-Houli and Xinglongwa cultures
