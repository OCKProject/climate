<p id="Par25" class="p">As temperatures and precipitation increased with the Holocene Climatic Optimum after ~8000 cal BP, an intensified summer monsoon brought more rainfall to northern China during the warm seasons

 </sup>. This climatic pattern provided favorable conditions that likely increased the competitive advantages of Paniceae grasses and resulted in more productive and reliable yields, likely coupled with increasing areas of more highly tended fields as millet systematic agriculture is adopted, thus reducing available stands of Triticeae. At the same time, planting, harvesting, storage, and processing technologies improved, as new cooking and other cultural practices evolved that favored millet cereal consumption, all perhaps driving human selection of millets with higher yields that could then produce more than the “normal surplus” in order to have domestic storage to sustain farming communities during seasons of scarcity

 </sup>, as well as for newly emerging ritual demands. Cishan and related sites support this hypothesis by the evidence mentioned, such as the 5-meter deep storage pits containing an estimated 50,000 kg of grain crops, as well as the great numbers of grinding stones (which are also larger and more standardized in form than Late Pleistocene ones), more elaboration in pottery vessel types and greatly increased amounts of pottery, and more polished stone axes and adzes (for land clearance), and polished stone sickles

 </sup>. At the same time, rising winter temperatures during the Holocene Climatic Optimum could have been unfavorable for the growth of Triticeae grasses adapted to a relatively cold winter or spring for their development.
