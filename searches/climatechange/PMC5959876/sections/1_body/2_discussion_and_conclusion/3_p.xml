<p id="Par16" class="p">We posit that changes in the trajectories for the two exploited tribes, featuring the increasing preference for Paniceae (likely wild millets) leading to domestication for agricultural production with concomitant decreases in Triticeae consumption, are the result of a series of choices through time by Late Paleolithic and early Neolithic groups. These were in response to the increasing availability and productive yields of certain grasses that were resultant from changing global climate and local environments. Some changes in plant physiology and distribution were also the result of human agency, likely featuring selection and tending, management, and eventual cultivation. While detailed understanding of the dynamics of human-plant interactions must await further archaeological finds and studies, here we can begin by modeling the choices made in selecting millets over Triticeae, which we hypothesize were mostly influenced by changing environmental conditions in North China.</p>
