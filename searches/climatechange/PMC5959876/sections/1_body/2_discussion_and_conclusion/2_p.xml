<p id="Par15" class="p">For Late Pleistocene sites, because macro-remains are poorly preserved, starch analysis often provides our only entryway to reconstructing plant exploitation patterns, in spite of small sample sizes and limited capability of only identifying to the tribe level. TheÂ small sample sizes, which are due to the ephemeral nature of site occupations and the complex issues of preservation and recovery, unfortunately, do not allow validation by statistical tests. The advantages of starch analysis, however, include the identification of plant use in the absence of macro-remains and the unique capability of enabling the identification of plants that were processed by specific tools, such as by grinding tools likely used in food processing, and thus can provide direct evidence of food consumption

 </sup>. While preserved plant macro-remains are rare in earlier hunter-gatherer sites, remains from Neolithic settlements provide species-level identifications using wild vs. domesticated morphologies of millets; they also allow the recognition of broader spectra of exploited plant food resources at these sites than previously understood, including cereals, fruits, tubers, and especially nuts. Macro-remains are practically unknown for Late Pleistocene sites
