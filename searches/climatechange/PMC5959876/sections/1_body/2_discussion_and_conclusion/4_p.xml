 </sup>: these impact seasonal availability, abundance, and predictability of the plants, and observant foragers and early cultivators would have recognized such changes and perhaps promoted some through selection and management. To evaluate the role of climatic conditions in North China, we review the paleoclimatic sequence as known from recent proxies, including ice core, pollen, and speleothem profiles, and then place the archaeologically-known starch trajectories into their paleoenvironmental contexts.
