The amplified growth conditions and spatial distribution of the C4 plants of the Paniceae tribe caused their increased abundance and availability for foragers over the grasses of the Triticeae C3 species.

In addition, the rainfall patterns during the warm seasons assisted millet’s growth and increased its biomass productivity and therefore its annual yield potential. The combined natural effects would not escape the observations of local hunter-gatherers, who apparently preferentially selected the more profitable Paniceae grasses, leading to intentional cultivation and eventual domestication.
