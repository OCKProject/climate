 </sup>, foragers in North China continued to exploit Triticeae grasses, but in decreasing amounts, as is documented by the archaeological evidence. This phenomenon may be related to climatic conditions during this period. Global paleoclimatic records demonstrate the enduring presence of large ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–g</xref>) indicate that the early Holocene witnessed a moderate climatic amelioration including the rise of temperature and subdued precipitation when compared to the subsequent Holocene Climatic Optimum after c. 8000 cal BP. However, during the initial domestication of the millets around 9500–8500 cal BP by cultivators living in early permanently settled villages, the domesticated cereals’ seasonal yields were relatively low

 </sup>. The continued but decreasing exploitation of Triticeae grasses needs to be considered within this context. Various scenarios for this type of co-existence are possible, including the continued presence of small, natural stands of Triticeae in favorable microenvironments near the sites or growing in plots primarily intended for millets that could be exploited, preference for longer-term storage of millets with consumption of Triticeae when it ripened in summer before the new millet crops matured, and the increasing entrenchment of cultural preferences for cereals and nutritional dependence on them.
