<p id="Par26" class="p">In conclusion, we hypothesize that the interactions between the climatic fluctuations of the Terminal Pleistocene to early Holocene period and the particular physiological needs of grasses in both the Paniceae and Triticeae tribes resulted in their different relative availability, abundance, and yield stability after

These considerations very likely influenced the decisions of foragers, who then became cultivators, thus paving the road for millet domestication. The starch evidence presented here gives our first insights into cereal exploitation patterns from across the entire period of the lengthy domestication process, and these can serve to guide future research and the discovery of more macro-remains to support our hypothesis.
