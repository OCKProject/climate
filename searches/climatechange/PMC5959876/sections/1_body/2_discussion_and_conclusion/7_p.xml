In contrast, grasses of the Paniceae tribe are warm-season and more drought-resistant C4 plants that mature in the fall and have a wider seasonal window for their growth, and thus could more successfully sustain climatic fluctuations during the Holocene

 </sup>. Their ecological attributes make them available for human consumption during a longer period during the year, especially in the summer and fall seasons. Under any conditions, increasing reliance on cereals required the development of storage. The 8000–7500 cal BP Cishan deep storage pits demonstrate that this technique for conserving grain for winter season consumption and for security against bad seasons was already in place
