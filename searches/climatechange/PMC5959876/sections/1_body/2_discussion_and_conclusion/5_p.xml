The combined impact of these variables on water resources and biomass productivity could have led to severely decreased food resources for hunter-gatherers in North China, who would be forced to adopt various measures to minimize risks. While higher mobility is sometimes seen as a possible solution, environmental limitations in North China during this extreme period would have made high mobility impossible, and they forced hunter-gatherers to aggregate and compete for resources that had become more patchy
