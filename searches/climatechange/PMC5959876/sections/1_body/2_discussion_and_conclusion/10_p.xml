 </sup>, but perhaps this initial practice was abandoned and a second cultivation event occurs again with worsening environment during the Younger Dryas. A Younger Dryas mechanism was perhaps active in China, as well, as Paniceae starch evidence from Donghulin likely indicates that foxtail millet and/or its wild progenitor are probably undergoing cultivation

 </sup>. These observations point to the cold and dry conditions of the Younger Dryas, coupled with “relative population pressure” in a particular region, as the triggers for the start of small-scale cultivation of millets in North China.
