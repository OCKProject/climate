<p id="Par30" class="p">The lithic tools from the sites of Nanzhuangtou, Cishan, and Jiangjialiang were sampled at the storage rooms of the Heibei Provincial Institute of Archaeology and Cultural Relics in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, and the tools from the sites of Jian’gou, Luojiayingzi and Sanjianfang were sampled at the storage rooms of the Ongniud Banner Museum, Inner Mongolia. Tools selected for sampling were initially cleaned by brush to remove adhering dust from storage and then washed clean with ultra-pure water. Cavities on the surface of the tools were then targeted for residue removal. 20–40 microlitres of ultra-pure water were applied to the areas of interest and left there to hydrate for 3–5 minutes. The wetted area was agitated with a metal pin to dislodge the sediment within the cavities. Finally, a sample of this material was removed with a micropipette and transferred to a clean, new, snap-cap vial for storage. These samples were processed in the laboratory where starches were floated by CsCl according to the methods described above.</p>
