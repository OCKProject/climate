<p id="Par27" class="p">Ancient starches can be recovered from residues on the surfaces of tools, carbonized residues of potsherds, dental calculus, and cultural deposits. Here we selected just one type of lithic tool, the paired slab and muller (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), as these grinding implements are used in food processing at sites in North China beginning in the Late Pleistocene and continuing through the Holocene. Their larger surface areas allow for higher chances of starch preservation than other, smaller tools. They also likely provide direct evidence of food consumption, assuming the processed cereal seeds were eaten. Limiting the study to these grinding tools allows us to look at the same food processing behaviors through time as they relate to the exploitation of starchy grasses. Archaeological experience and ethnography demonstrate that producing a bulk of cereal plant food to be made into porridge, steamed, baked, or brewed requires the use of grinding slabs or mortars.
