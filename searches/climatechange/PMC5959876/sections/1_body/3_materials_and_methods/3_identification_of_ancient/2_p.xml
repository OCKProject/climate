<p id="Par33" class="p">Our starch keys and classifications emphasize attributes: overall grain shape; contour and surface features; position and form of the hilum and fissure, if any; number and characteristics of pressure facets; presence or absence of demonstrable lamellae; and mean length averaged from the measurement of 100â€“150 grains. Each starch grain observed under the microscope was photographed, then grouped based on morphological features.</p>
