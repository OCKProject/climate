<p id="Par5" class="p">Documenting the process of millet domestication requires evidence for cultivation of the wild species within a region where wild cultivation and dry-land farming could be successful in producing the surplus needed to feed growing semi-sedentary to sedentary populations. The region had to feature the required growing conditions for millets. Foxtail millet has a growing season of 60–120 days while broomcorn millet’s is 45–100 days; each has certain heat requirements, such as cardinal temperatures for germination for broomcorn millet of 30–40 °C and for foxtail millet of 20–30 °C, but also, these cereals are relatively unable to withstand frost (compared to wheat or barley)

 </sup> can provide reconstructions of climate fluctuations and environmental changes from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene Optimum in which to place our data, allowing us to hypothesize possible mechanisms responsible for the divergent paths of the grass tribes, with millets becoming more intensively cultivated and the Triticeae grasses being abandoned.
