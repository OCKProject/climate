<p id="Par4" class="p">The origins of agriculture are best understood today in southwestern Asia, where broad spectrum exploitation of edible plants was followed by the selection of a limited number of species for cultivation, with resultant domestication emerging during the early Neolithic period

 </sup>. The cereal domesticates were barley (

 </sup>. In order to model the process leading to the farming of domesticated millet, we treat the starch evidence from the nine archaeological sites as representative of distinct stages that led to eventual domestication. Our evidence shows the differing consumption of grasses in both the Triticeae and Paniceae tribes and reflects changing patterns in human-plant relationships

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. The stages in this process include collecting wild cereals by mobile foraging groups; early cultivation of wild cereals possibly involving management and selection; further cultivation by less mobile/sedentary bands; cultivation of wild millets with planting and harvesting near permanent Neolithic villages; and the agricultural production of domesticated millet. In particular, we document the decreasing consumption of members of the Triticeae grasses and increase in Paniceae members—likely the wild progenitors of foxtail millet (
 <italic class="italic">Setaria italica</italic>) and broomcorn millet (
 <italic class="italic">Panicum miliaceum</italic>)—as they come to be cultivated, farmed, and domesticated. Other terminology used for such stages in this evolutionary continuum, after Harris
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>, include “pre-domestication cultivation”, “semi-domestication”, and a later “full domestication”

 </sup>. Although starch granules cannot be identified to the species, we can infer the wild or domesticated millet species are represented at the various sites based on identifications of rare finds of charred macro-remains of these millets

 </sup>. The starch evidence raises a critical question: why did the exploitation of Triticeae and Paniceae grasses in North China ultimately result in the selection of millets as the crop to be domesticated for a dry-land farming system while the grasses of the Triticeae tribe were abandoned?
