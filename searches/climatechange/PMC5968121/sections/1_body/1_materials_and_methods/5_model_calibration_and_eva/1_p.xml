<p class="p">We ran MAXENT (version 3.3.3a) with the default convergence threshold of 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> and with 5,000 iterations. This number of iterations was set to allow the model a reasonable scope for convergence, thus reducing the risk of over-predicting or under-predicting the model relationships. The selected model used the “Linear” and “Quadratic” feature types and the regularization parameter of 2, as indicated by the lowest AICc value. We processed 20 model replications with bootstrap resampling which randomly allocated 75% of the occurrence records to calibration and 25% to validation. We used the average of the 20 replicate models to produce habitat suitability maps under current and future scenarios. MAXENT produces continuous suitability index in its output, 10 percentile training presence threshold was employed to convert this index into binary form (suitable and unsuitable habitat; Rebelo and Jones,
