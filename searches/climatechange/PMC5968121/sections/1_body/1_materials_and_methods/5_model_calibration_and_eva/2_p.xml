<p class="p">AUC (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) was used to test the performance of the model against actual observations (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). An AUC value of 0.5 shows that the model does not predict any better than random chance, whereas a value closer to 1 indicates better performance of the model. Based on the AUC value, a conventionally used guide for ranking the model performance is: 0.5–0.6 = Failed; 0.6–0.7 = Poor; 0.7–0.8 = Fair; 0.8–0.9 = Good; 0.9–1 = Excellent (Swets,

Fitted response curves were used to visually investigate the relationship between individual variables and predicted index of environmental suitability of
