<p class="p">AUC was suggested not be sufficiently reliable for model evaluation, as an alternative, the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) can be utilized a complementary evaluation index (Breiner et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The Boyce index requires presence data only and measures how much model predictions differ from random distribution of observed presence across the prediction gradient. The continuous values of Boyce index vary between âˆ’1 and +1. Positive values indicate a model where predictions are consistent with the distribution of actual presence data, values close to zero mean that the model is not different from a random model and negative values indicate counter predictions (e.g., predicting no occurrence in areas where actual presence is recorded, Boyce et al.,
