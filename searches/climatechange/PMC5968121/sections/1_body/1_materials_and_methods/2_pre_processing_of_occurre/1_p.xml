<p class="p">Presence-only occurrence records of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> were obtained from COFNOD (Local Environmental Records Centre in Wales, UK). A dataset totaling 436 occurrence records originating from a continuous field observation campaign spanning the period between 1981 and 2016. COFNOD has confirmed that the entire area of Snowdonia National Park had been thoroughly surveyed by ground surveys and remote sensing tools, thus minimizing the possibility of sampling bias in the dataset. Consequently, in our modeling effort we covered the entire area of the national park, generating 10,000 random background points to be selected from in each replicate run of the model. Spatial uncertainty of all occurrence records was verified and all duplicate or not geo-referenced occurrence points were removed. Occurrence data were spatially rarefied by eliminating all but one point present within a single grid cell of the predictor variable layers to reduce spatial autocorrelation. As a result, the number of occurrence points used for model calibration and verification was reduced from 452 to 92.
