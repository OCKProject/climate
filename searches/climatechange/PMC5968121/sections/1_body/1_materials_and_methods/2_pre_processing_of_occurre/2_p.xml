<p class="p">We considered a total of 23 predictor variables (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>) covering Snowdonia National Park at a cell resolution of 30–arc-seconds (~1 km, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">worldclim.org</ext-link>, version 1.4, Hijmans et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). These 23 variables were selected on the basis of published information on plant-habitat associations of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic>. We included bioclimatic variables, together with a land cover variable as 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> is a habitat-specialist and thus sensitive to land cover type. In addition, we included topographic factors such as slope, aspect and altitude as these factors are also known to limit the distribution of this species (Erfmeier and Bruelheide,

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In all, our predictor dataset consisted of 19 climatic variables were complemented by 3 topographic and 1 land cover variable. A Digital Elevation Model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission,

Land Cover data originates from “The European Space Agency CCI” global land cover product available at 300 m of spatial resolution (

The whole set of 23 variables (19 climatic, 1 land cover, and 3 topographic) was re-sampled to 1 km spatial resolution and masked to the extent of Snowdonia National Park. A combination of expert knowledge, published studies on 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> invasiveness in the UK and statistical methods was used to select an appropriate set of predictor variables to reduce the negative impact of multicollinearity and to conform to statistical assumptions (Syfert et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). We removed highly correlated variables by applying a Pearson correlation coefficient cutoff of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> ≤ 0.85 to select the variable layers for use in final model runs (Graham, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>).
