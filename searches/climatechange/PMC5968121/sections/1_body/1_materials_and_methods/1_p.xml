<p class="p">We used MAXENT, a maximum-entropy based machine learning algorithm to model the distribution 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> (L.) in Snowdonia National Park. MAXENT predicts the probability distribution of a species on the basis of a given set of environmental variables and presence-only species occurrence data (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). We selected MAXENT because, (a) it does not require absence data (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), (b) it efficiently handles complex interactions between predictor and response variables (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), (c) being a generative model, it performs better than discriminative models when it comes to modeling with presence-only records and, (d) it can be run with both categorical and continuous data variables (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). There are several known limitations of the MAXENT modeling environment; (a) sensitivity to small sample size and questionable occurrence records (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), (b) use of overly complex models due to user over-reliance on default model calibration settings (Moreno-Amat et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and (c) biased performance due to errors in sampling effort or spatial autocorrelation of occurrence records (Veloz, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In this study, we countered these model limitations by; (a) using reasonably large sample size and applying recommended screening and verification of occurrence records, (b) tuning the model by identifying optimal model calibration settings, and (c) accounting for sampling bias and applying spatial filters to reduce spatial autocorrelation.
