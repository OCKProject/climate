<p class="p">Land cover for 2050 was simulated in Terrset software (Eastman, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) using recommended protocols (Dadhich and Hanaoka, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ozturk, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Ye et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Making use of the Multi-layer Perceptron-Markov Chain (MLP-MC) model, we projected the future land cover changes of Snowdonia National Park in 2050 based on historical changes in the land cover between 2005 and 2015. The land cover maps for 2005 and 2015 were acquired from “The European Space Agency CCI” global land cover product. Land cover transitions were modeled using a Multi-layer Perceptron neural network. A transition matrix was created to quantify the transition potential between the two time periods. For the sake of simplicity, we assumed that the transition probabilities (patterns of change) would remain unchanged in future and used these to predict land cover for 2050. We used a number of driver or explanatory variables to generate transition potential maps to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. These driver variables included elevation, aspect, hillshade, slope, distance to roads, distance to road nodes, distance to water channels, distance to hydro nodes, distance to green space sites, and distance to access points. A flow chart of the land cover and species distribution modeling is shown in Figure
