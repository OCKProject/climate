<p class="p">Projected future climatic conditions for the year 2050 based on the IPCC 5th assessment report were used to assess the potential effects of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> habitat suitability in Snowdonia National Park. We used the following six GCMs projections: BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, GISS-E2-R, MIROC5, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-LR.

RCP 4.5 describes a scenario where GHG emissions are stabilized and thus represents a stable scenario, while RCP 8.5 is a scenario depicting an extreme situation where GHG emissions increase until 2100 (Akhter et al.,
