<p class="p">In addition to climate, distribution of invasive plant species is often strongly linked to land cover type. For instance, transportation corridors, continuous grasslands, forest areas, and proximity to human settlements are often reported as strong determinants of species spread (Decker et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). A score of SDM studies indicates that land cover is often a far better predictor of species habitat suitability than climatic variables (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Alkhamis et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Bosso et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Padalia and Bahuguna, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Changes in land cover can affect both quality and quantity of suitable habitat, in some instances the landscape variables alone can accurately predict the distribution of a species (Hailu et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). It is therefore recommended to consider climate and land cover change in combination when exploring species' niche shifts in future (Dale, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, despite the fact that land cover is an integral part of species' ecological niche, the majority of SDM studies investigating species' future distribution ignore it and assume that species' future distribution is only driven by shifts in climatic variables (Khanum et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Khadka and James, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Qin et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The history of climatic changes and human land use shows that land cover types will shift, any modeling of species' future distribution based merely on climatic variables may lead to a severely misleading prediction (de Chazal and Rounsevell, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
