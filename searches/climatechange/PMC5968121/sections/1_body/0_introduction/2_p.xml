<p class="p">Once an invasive species has established itself, one of the most cost effective ways to reduce its threat is to map its current distribution and take pre-emptive measures to prevent further expansion (Alves et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Such targeted management of biological invasions is not possible without information about the likely future distribution of invasive species. In this context, species distribution models (SDMs) present a workable opportunity to examine future changes in species distribution (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). As climate is a strong determinant of habitat suitability of plant species (Marino et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), SDMs are often driven by environmental variables. Also known as ecological niche models, they are successfully being used for projecting the impacts of climate change on plant distributions (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ramírez-Albores et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In principle, species are assumed to exist in a “niche” described by ecological requirements of the species. SDMs characterize these ecological space of a species and subsequently identify vulnerable locations based on the environmental suitability of the species (Trivedi et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
