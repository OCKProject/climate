<p class="p">We examine the current and future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK under current and future land cover and climatic conditions (LCCs). Our modeling effort aims to, (a) delineate “invasion hotspots” for 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia National Park, (b) identify key ecological factors driving the spread of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in the park, and (c) identify likely spatial patterns of habitat suitability under future climate conditions to establish a theoretical reference framework for management plans to combat the potential invasion of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic>.
