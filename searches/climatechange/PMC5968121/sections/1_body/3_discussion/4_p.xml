<p class="p">The fact that 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> is an alien invasive species in the area under consideration is an important aspect of this study. Invasion is a dynamic process guided by an inherited set of traits and environmental conditions (Erfmeier and Bruelheide, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). One of the ways to build a species distribution model is to use climatic data and occurrence records from the native range of the invasive species under consideration and to project it to the invaded region (Kaplan et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, we argue that this approach may yield a poorly performing model due to the mismatch between key environmental variables between native and invaded regions. This argument is borne out by the notion that invasives are a good example of species with a potential to expand their range beyond the climatic envelope defined in their native range (Rödder and Lötters, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). A number of studies have confirmed this idea by concluding that invaded locations cannot necessarily be predicted from native distribution records of invasive species (Fernández and Hamilton, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). If the goal is to evaluate range expansion of invasive species then it could be useful to fit the model with data from native range (Araújo and Guisan, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), but when building models to predict changes in the invaded area under climate change scenarios, it may be much more useful to use data describing affected location (Jeschke and Strayer, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
