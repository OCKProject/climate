<p class="p">For climatic variables, our results indicate that both temperature- and precipitation-related variables make significant contribution to model prediction, which is in agreement with earlier studies which posit that the future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Wales may be affected by climatic predictors (Kang et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Under all GCMs considered here, habitat suitability range decreases from the current situation. Global mean temperatures may increase by as much as 4Â°C by the end of next century (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Increasing temperature and changes in precipitation are likely to impact species distribution (Bezeng et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), however, existing investigations paint a mixed picture; plant species may experience an increase or a decrease of their current range (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Bradley et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). A study investigating potential changes in the future distribution of a 100 of the world's worst invasive species concluded that potential range of the majority of these species would increase (Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Contrary to this, there is evidence of a range reduction of over 80 invasive species in South Africa under varying climate change scenarios (Bezeng et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Similarly, many other ecological modeling studies have reported a possible contraction in suitable habitat of different species (Smale and Wernberg, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). There are studies even predicting a complete loss of species' suitable habitat (Midgley et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Bomhard et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Sarmento Cabral et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Detailed studies are thus required to investigate how an existing plant invasion will be modified by changing climatic conditions; it is not likely that all invasive species will benefit from new conditions.
