<p class="p">This study presents the first attempt to delineate current distribution and investigate the impacts of changing landscape and climate on future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia National Park. Both current and future distributions of this invasive plant are governed by an interaction of a range of factors. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia, land cover and topography have been shown as the most influential, complemented by a range of climatic factors.
