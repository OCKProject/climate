<p class="p">In this study, we projected land cover changes from 2015 to 2050 based on the land cover transition potential between 2005 and 2015. This is a simplistic and frequently adopted, “business-as-usual” approach of land use change modeling, which however may not be realistic. We suggest that the impact of contrasting socio-economic scenarios on likely future land use should be included to achieve a more representative prediction of future distribution.</p>
