<p class="p">Given that 14 out of 19 climatic variables originally considered for this study were excluded due to high correlation with variables chosen for the best performing model, an in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> distribution to the remaining variables may reveal interesting insights. We made use of only six GCMs and two RCPs scenarios for the sake of simplicity, but further studies including more numerous GCMs and RCPs may prove useful for improved prediction of future distribution and a better understanding of the sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> to climate change. In line with the consideration of native vs. invaded climate envelope, further studies should compare model performance based on training on native and invaded climatic envelope range. Distribution models may be improved by the inclusion of high resolution variables derived from remote sensing and lidar (canopy height, cover, vertical distribution ratio etc.), variables such as vegetation density or stand height have been shown to significantly improve SDMs (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ackers et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this study, the land cover variable is considered as a proxy for the soil properties (Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> is known to grow under semi-shade on moist, loamy soils. Thus, the land cover types “Forest” “Bog &amp; Mosses” &amp; “Herbaceous cover” can be thought to act as proxy for these soil types while land cover types such as “open fields,” “bare land”, “urban areas,” and “rocks” can be considered the areas where soils types are the least favorable for this species. Results of this study confirm these observations. We however, recommend incorporating soil variables for future studies to further improve the accuracy of the model.
