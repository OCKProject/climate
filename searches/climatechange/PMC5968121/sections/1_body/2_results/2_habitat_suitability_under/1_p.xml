<p class="p">Binary maps of predicted distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia National park under current and future LCCs are shown in Supplementary Data 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S2</xref>. Based on the output of our model, nearly 50% of the total area of the park (1,050 of 2,132 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) is currently suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> invasion. Looking into the future, the extent of habitat suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in Snowdonia National park is likely to be negatively affected by land cover and climate change under all considered scenarios (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">4</xref>).
