<p class="p">Under RCP 4.5, minimum contraction (−3.45%) is predicted under MIROC5 while maximum contraction (−40.13%) in suitable area may take place under MPI-ESM-LR. Under RCP 8.5, minimum (−7.97%) and maximum (−46.78%) reduction in suitability range for 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> may be expected under GCMs HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-LR, respectively. A comparison of the current habitat suitability with the minimum and maximum future range contraction (binary maps) is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>. Results indicate that most of the northern, northeastern and central areas of the national park are likely to become unsuitable for 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> by 2050 (in case of maximum contraction under GCM MPI-ESM, RCP 8.5). Detailed habitat suitability maps of all future LCCs are presented in Supplementary Data
