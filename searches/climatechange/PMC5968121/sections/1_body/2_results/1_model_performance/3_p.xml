<p class="p">Close inspection of individual response curves (Supplementary Data 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>) shows how the logistic prediction by a variable changes when the rest of the predictor variables are artificially kept at their average values. Starting with Land Cover, the only categorical predictor used in this study, it suggests that the presence of several land use types may have a major influence on the probability of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> occurrence in Snowdonia National park. The likelihood of presence is the highest in Land Cover type “8” (Mosaic tree and shrub), followed by Land Cover type “6” (Needle leaved forest). Aspect was found to be an efficient predictor of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> distribution, indicating that the probability of occurrence is the highest in Northern Aspect (azimuth values ranging from 337.5 to 360°). The response curve of Altitude shows that the probability of presence is negatively correlated with this variable as increasing altitude suggests a gradual decrease in the probability of species occurrence. Precipitation seasonality (BIO 15) was shown to be negatively correlated to the probability of the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic>; the species is not likely to tolerate higher seasonal variability in precipitation in Wales. It is noteworthy that the probability of species occurrence decreases from 67 to as low as 27 within a narrow band defined by 22 and 25 mm of precipitation seasonality. Response curve of BIO 9 (Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter) shows a similar trend, 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> probability of occurrence decreases as the mean temperature of the driest quarter increases. BIO 2 (Mean Diurnal Range) and BIO 3 are only two climatic variables which appear to be positively correlated with the probability of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> occurrence. BIO 4 (the coefficient of variation of the mean of monthly temperatures, represents the seasonal variation in temperature) and Slope contributed the least to the model. Response curves of both these variables suggest that probability of species occurrence would decrease with increasing values of these variables.
