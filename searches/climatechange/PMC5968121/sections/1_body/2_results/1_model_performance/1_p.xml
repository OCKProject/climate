<p class="p">The calibration test of the model specification selected on the basis of the lowest AICc showed encouraging predictive capacity: AUC
 <sub class="sub">train</sub> = 80.0, AUC
 <sub class="sub">test</sub> = 75.61, and CBI = 0.82. These results suggest that the predictor variables used during model calibration can predict the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> in the Snowdonia National park with a fairly good degree of accuracy. Current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> on a continuous habitat suitability map for the present day LCCs is shown in Figure
