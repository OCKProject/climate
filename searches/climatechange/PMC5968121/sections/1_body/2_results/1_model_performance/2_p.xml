<p class="p">Comparing the predictor variables used in this model, Land Cover type contributed the most predictive power (43.3%), followed by aspect (21.5%), and altitude (15.5%, Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>). The Jackknife test suggests that the variable which decreases the gain the most when omitted is land cover, indicating that it contains the most information absent in the other variables (Figure
