<p class="p">This study presents the results of correlative ecological modeling exercise based on an assumption that land cover and climatic variables have a dominant role in current and future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> and that the ecological niche for this species remains conserved across time. We show that, contrary to expectation, future distribution range of this species in Snowdonia National Park may decrease as a result of projected climate and land use changes. An extension of this modeling approach to the entire landscape of UK might help to understand the combined effects of these predictor variables to future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. ponticum</italic> across the country.
