<p id="Par40" class="p">From a moral point of view, the acceptability of the Lindahl solution is hampered because it is in conflict with both the polluter pays principle and ability to pay principle. Gardiner (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2004</xref>, p. 590) concludes that: “… there is a great deal of convergence on the issue of who has primary responsibility to act on climate change. The most defensible accounts of fairness and climate change suggest that the rich countries should bear the brunt, and perhaps even the entirety, of the costs.” In the same vein, the Executive Summary of the Stern Review (Stern 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2007</xref>, p. 23) states that “Securing broad-based and sustained co-operation requires an equitable distribution of effort across both developed and developing countries. There is no single formula that captures all dimensions of equity, but calculations based on income, historic responsibility and per capita emissions all point to rich countries taking responsibility for emissions reductions of 60–80% from 1990 levels by 2050.” Apparently, both Gardiner and Stern favor a burden sharing rule in which the rich countries bear the lion share of the costs due to their higher ability to pay and to the polluter pays principle.
