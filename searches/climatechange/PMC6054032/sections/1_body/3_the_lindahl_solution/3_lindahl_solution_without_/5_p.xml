<p id="Par49" class="p">The Lindahl planner will assign abatement shares to countries, taking into account that each one maximizes Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ22" ref-type="" class="xref">18</xref>), in such a way that given their assigned abatement shares, they will choose the same global abatement level.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13" class="xref">13</xref> In the empirical section, we show that there is a global abatement level compatible with the constraint that the sum of the abatement shares is unity and that given these shares, each country will choose that level of global abatement as being optimal. However, there is a production inefficiency due to the differentiated, country-specific, marginal cost of abatement, which can be solved by implementing a global permit market.
