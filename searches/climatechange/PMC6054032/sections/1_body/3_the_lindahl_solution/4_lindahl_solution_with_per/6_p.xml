Countries particularly vulnerable to climate change (e.g., the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and islands in the Pacific Ocean all threatened by a sea level rise) will be assigned a higher target contribution because of their higher values of

Taking stock, the Lindahl solution enables the IPCC to secure the achievement of the overall abatement objective while at the same time to assess whether the contribution of each country is in line with its willingness to pay for the global public good of limiting global warming.
