<p id="Par41" class="p">However, assessing burdens to combat climate change is not merely a morality play. Countries are sovereign and a burden sharing rule based on moral principles—such as the polluter pays principle or the ability to pay principle—is only as strong as the commitment of countries to these principles.

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11" class="xref">11</xref> Our proposed burden sharing rule is based on countries’ willingness to contribute to combat climate change, which naturally leads to the Lindahl solution to the optimal public good provision level. The Lindahl solution has two major disadvantages. Firstly, the willingness to pay is not only influenced by the expected damage but also by the adaptation costs, which puts many poor countries in a precarious position if they lack the resources and know-how for adaptation. Secondly, contributions according to willingness to pay may be squarely at odds with contributions based either on the ability to pay and the polluter pays principle. For the sake of argument, suppose that the USA is protected from any consequences of climate change and that only the rest of the world would suffer damages. According to ability to pay and the polluter pays principle, the USA would have to contribute heavily, but its willingness to pay might be low. Analogous, the burden assigned to a poor country at sea level according to ability to pay and polluter pays will be low, but relatively high according to willingness to pay. In theory, countries that would benefit from global warming (e.g., Russia, Canada, and Greenland) may have a negative willingness to pay, which implies that they have to be compensated for their participation in an international agreement to abate greenhouse gases. This suggests that concerns of redistribution between rich and poor should be excluded in considerations of how to assess fair burden sharing to combat climate change. What we propose is therefore that climate change policy must be evaluated on its own merits, and the same goes for policies to address global income inequality (see, e.g., Milanovic
