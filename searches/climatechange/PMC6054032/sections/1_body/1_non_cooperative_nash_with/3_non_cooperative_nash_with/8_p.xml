<p id="Par24" class="p">By definition, the last term is zero when the permit market clears, so Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ12" ref-type="" class="xref">8</xref> boils down to the global sum of marginal benefits of abatement (the LHS) to be equal to the permit price times the number of countries (the RHS). Although the second sub-optimality of the non-cooperating Nash solution without a global permit market is removed now that the same good abatement is produced at uniform instead of differentiated marginal costs, the first sub-optimality is still there; the price of abatement is, from a world point of view, much too low
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5" class="xref">5</xref> because the LHS of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="" class="xref">7</xref> does not contain the global but only the national marginal benefits of abatement.
