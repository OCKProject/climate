<p id="Par11" class="p">In modeling climate change and abatement, many choices have to be made. Does one take a static or a dynamic perspective, is the externality arising in consumption or production or both, is the approach rooted in welfare economics or game theory, what is the appropriate discount rate, and so on. In general, many of the choices made here are motivated by keeping the model as simple as possible in order to derive burden sharing rules of abatement under different regimes. In the first regime, serving as a benchmark for the models presented in subsequent sections, countries are assumed to follow their self-interest in a non-cooperative way. Following the withdrawal of the USA on 1 June 2017 from the Paris agreement, ratified on 5 October 2016 and due to the absence of a burden sharing rule and enforcement mechanism, it is not exaggerated to claim that the Nash model, where each country pursues its own interest taking into account the behavior of others, might still be an appropriate workhorse carrying a sense of realism in case the bottom-up Paris approach fails. Cramton and Stoft (
