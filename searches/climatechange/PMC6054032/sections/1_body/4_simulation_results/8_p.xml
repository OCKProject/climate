<p id="Par68" class="p">The last panel gives total abatement relative to (optimal) abatement (A), the share of total abatement cost financed by permits (TP), and the share of the total cost of abatement taken care of by the rich countries (TC). The first two of these measures are illustrated in Fig.

Production efficiency requires the regimes with permit markets. Among the permit market choice set {NP, SP, LP}, LP combines that abatement is at the optimal level and transfer payments as a share of total costs are at minimum. Taking stock, LP (L) are the only regimes that are Pareto-superior to N and combining (near) optimal abatement levels with modest (zero) redistribution payments.
