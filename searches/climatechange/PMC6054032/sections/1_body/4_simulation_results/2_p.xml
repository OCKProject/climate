<p id="Par59" class="p">TP is an indicator of the share of global abatement costs financed by other countriesâ€™ payments on the permit market. For regime LS, in which per capita incomes across countries are equalized and where it does not matter who pays how much, we set TP equal to unity to express that all costs of abatement are shared. If there is no permit market and every country finances its own abatement, the indicator TP is zero by definition.</p>
