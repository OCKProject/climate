<p id="Par66" class="p">The third panel gives information about per capita incomes (y), utility (u), world welfare (W), the permit price (q), average abatement cost (AC), the share of total abatement cost paid for by transfers (TP), and the share in total cost of buyers on the permit market (TC). Not surprisingly, global per capita welfare is at maximum in the lump sum case, but it would not be acceptable for Annex I. Departing from regime N, Annex I would even not be in favor to move to regime NP (due to the polarization effect), nor to S or SP. The only transitions that increase utility for Annex I are the Lindahl regimes L and LP. For Annex II, all other regimes than N are better in utility terms, where S and SP are preferred to L and LP. Taken together, departing from N, only L and LP are Pareto improvements and LP Pareto dominates L, so LP would be a viable outcome.
