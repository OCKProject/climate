<p id="Par65" class="p">The top panel in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> contains the descriptive statistics: population (in millions), GDP (in billions USD), income per capita, emissions (in Mt.), emission per capita (in tonnes), emission intensity, and the marginal cost adjustment parameter 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ37" ref-type="" class="xref">26</xref>). Income per capita in Annex I countries is more than seven times as high as in Annex II countries and emissions per capita is more than three times as high. In the second panel, (target) levels of abatement and reduction rates are given, where we take the actual emission levels in 2014 as the business-as-usual outcome (which implies that the Nash outcome is the one where Annex I and I operate as blocks). Firstly, total abatement with a permit market under the same regime is always higher or equal (total abatement under S and SP are set equal by assumption) than without. Secondly, in the shift from N to NP, the Annex II target abatement level under Nash with a permit market is even below its actual abatement without a permit market. This result can be explained by polarization, also described by Cramton and Stoft (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2010</xref>, p. 6), where the rich will choose an even higher target level because abatement can be bought more cheaply under a permit market, while the poor region will choose an even lower target level of abatement to benefit from permit trading. Thirdly, total abatement under the social planner, without (S) or with (SP) a permit market, is higher than under Lindahl (L). This is because assigning abatement burdens has a dual role for the social planner SP, not only to mitigate global warming but also to redistribute income or welfare. In case of S, Annex I is assigned a very high abatement burden (a reduction rate of 84%, against only 47% for Annex II), because the welfare cost of abatement for the rich countries are relatively small, while the benefits of abatement are global.
