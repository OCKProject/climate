 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> gives an overview of the scores on salient variables if the world is divided into only two blocks, Annex I and Annex II. The Annex I countries comprise the regions Europe and Oceania (EU) and North America (NA). The non-Annex I countries comprise the regions sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East and North Africa (AF), South America and Central America and Caribbean (SA), and Asia (AS). In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, the results are presented if the world is divided into five regions.
