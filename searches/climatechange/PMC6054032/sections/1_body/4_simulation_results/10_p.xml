<p id="Par70" class="p">Because there are now more players, total abatement levels under Nash are almost halved compared to when Annex I and II operate as blocks. Departing from N, again only L and LP are Pareto improvements for all regions and LP Pareto dominates L. A striking outcome in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> is that for both Africa and South America, it is optimal to choose negative target abatement levels. The extreme polarization leads here to the situation that under NP total abatement is even lower than under N, despite the efficiency gains of a permit market. Note that under regime NP, each player is free to choose its optimal target level. Net revenues from the permit market equals

 </sub>), so although South America abates 240 Mt., by choosing a target level of − 3333 Mt. and selling permits for the equilibrium price of $15.6 per tonne, it receives $55.7 billion on the permit market, while Africa receives $60.6 billion.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18" class="xref">18</xref> Asia (due to its high population), North American, and Europe and Oceania (due to their high per capita incomes) together pay in total 116.3 billion (their combined target abatement levels of 13,022 Mt. minus their combined actual abatement of 5558 Mt., times $15.6 per tonne), whereas total abatement cost is only 49 billion (total abatement under NP equal to 6451 Mt. times average cost of $7.6 per tonne). The main reason for the outlier position of regime NP in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, b is that transfer payments under NP outweigh total abatement cost, which is not so much due that the average cost of abatement is below the permit price or marginal cost, but because of polarization.
