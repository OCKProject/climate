<p id="Par26" class="p">Now, suppose countries agree to install a social planner (labeled S) to redress the sub-optimalities of the Nash outcome. If S is given not only the power to set the burden sharing rule for abatement but also the power to redistribute income, the global welfare maximizing outcome will be equality of marginal utilities of income across countries and uniform marginal cost of abatement to ensure production efficiency (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec" class="xref">1</xref>). Although equity and efficiency are achieved simultaneously, it is not realistic to assume that in order to solve the global warming problem, however serious it may be, sovereign rich countries are prepared to equalize their per capita incomes to that of the rest of the world. Therefore, a more realistic version of S is that it lacks the instrument of income redistribution but is still given the restricted mandate to devise an optimal burden sharing abatement rule. We will see that the optimal rule requires the marginal welfare cost of abatement to be equal across countries. We distinguish S without and with the power to install a global permit market.
