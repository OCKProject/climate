 <xref rid="Equ17" ref-type="" class="xref">11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">2c</xref> shows that the first Nash sub-optimality of not taking positive externalities of abatement in one country to the rest of the world into account is now removed, but the second sub-optimality of differentiated, country-specific, marginal cost of abatement is still present due to the absence of a global permit market. This sub-optimality can be removed by empowering S to install a global permit market.
