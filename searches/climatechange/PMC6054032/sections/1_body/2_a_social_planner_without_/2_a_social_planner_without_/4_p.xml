 </sub>), is a world total and so not country specific. The denominator, marginal utility of per capita income, is country specific. As a consequence, marginal cost of abatement (the RHS) is also country specific. As the alternative expression of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ17" ref-type="" class="xref">11</xref> shows, S distributes the burden of abatement in such a way that, for each country, its marginal cost of abatement times the marginal utility per unit of income—this product can be interpreted as the marginal welfare cost of abatement—is equalized to the global marginal benefits of abatement. All other things equal, poor countries, having a high marginal utility of per capita income, will be assigned a low abatement level so that their (marginal) cost of abatement will be low. Summarizing, in comparison to the non-cooperative case, S is guided by two rules in the maximization of world welfare. First, by allocating abatement burdens to individual countries, the global abatement benefits are relevant, not the national. Second, instead of national marginal abatement cost equated to (marginal) benefits of abatement, now the marginal welfare cost per unit of abatement is equalized across countries.
