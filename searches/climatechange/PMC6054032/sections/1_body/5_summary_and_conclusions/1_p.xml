<p id="Par74" class="p">The Paris agreement of 2015 entails that both developed and developing countries limit their emissions, with 5-yearly reviews to ensure that national contributions are in line with the overall goal to reach at maximum 2 °C global warming, with an aspiration of 1.5 °C. In this paper, the abatement burden sharing rules emerging under different regimes, with and without permit markets, were derived. The sub-optimal level under Nash without permit market is due to both production inefficiencies in abatement and not taking global externalities of national abatement into account. The first sub-optimality can be removed by installing a permit market, but the second requires cooperation or coordination between countries. A social planner without the power to redistribute and without a permit market will impose the rule that the product of the marginal cost of abatement and the marginal utility of income be equalized across countries. This implies high abatement burdens and (marginal) costs for rich and low burdens and costs for poor countries, with the overall abatement level close to optimal. The same social planner but equipped with a permit market can organize transfer payments from rich to poor by assigning high target levels to rich and low target levels to poor regions. The burden sharing rule then has a secondary role of redistribution and without any constraint the social planner’s outcome will be the same as under an omnipotent social planner with lump sum redistribution.</p>
