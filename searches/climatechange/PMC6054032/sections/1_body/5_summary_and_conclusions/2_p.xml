<p id="Par75" class="p">In the simulations, we showed that the transition to a permit market under Nash can lead to polarization, eventually leading to lower overall abatement as shown for the world divided into five regions. Although poor countries prefer the social planner regime with permits the most, only the Lindahl regimes Pareto dominate the Nash regimes, with or without a permit market. Moreover, of all permit regimes, the Lindahl permit market entails the lowest degree of redistribution in the form of net transfer payments from rich to poor. Our preferred burden sharing rule can be summarized as that every country or region shares in the burden to combat climate change in proportion to its benefits, which are determined by the expected damages and adaptation costs. The burden sharing rule implied by the Lindhahl solution therefore provides a criterion to assess the national contributions to curb climate change. The Lindahl solution simultaneously achieves an optimal global abatement level and that each country is expected to contribute according to its willingness to pay, but the price to be paid is to disregard competing principles such as ability to pay and the polluter has to pay. In our analysis, we only differentiated countries by their income per capita and population size. Avenues for further research are to relate the Lindahl solution and the corresponding abatement burdens to country- or region-specific expected damages and associated adaptation costs from climate change as proxies for its willingness to pay (e.g., using an integrated assessment model such as RICE) and a more systematic comparison how the Lindahl solution fares compared to other fairness principles governing burden sharing rules for global public goods.</p>
