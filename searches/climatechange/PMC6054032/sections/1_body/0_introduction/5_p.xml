<p id="Par7" class="p">In the burden sharing debate of climate change, surprisingly little attention is paid to the LE.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> In the LE, each country is assigned an abatement share in such a way that given their assigned share, they all want the same level of the global public good—in this case global carbon emission abatement (for the derivation of Lindahl equilibria in public goods models, see Sandler and Murdoch

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2003</xref>). In such a LE, each country contributes to the global provision level according to its WTP. The saliency of WTP is that any International Environmental Agreement in which some countries have to contribute less than their WTP is a pity, because they are prepared to abate more. At the same time, a country will be reluctant to contribute in excess of its WTP, for instance, if it is prescribed to do so by invoking the polluter pays’ principle or ability to pay principle. Therefore, any deviation from the LE would mean that either some countries contribute less than their actual WTP, which is undesirable if we are to realize the aim of mitigating GHG emissions, or that some countries are supposed to contribute more than they are willing to, making the agreement unstable. Therefore, it is important to assess the burden sharing rule according to the LE and to check how it fares compared to other burden sharing rules.
