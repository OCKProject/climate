<p id="Par5" class="p">To illustrate the LE by means of a simple example, suppose two persons share a household in which the cleanliness of the house is considered a public good. The problem of burden sharing is how many hours every member of the household has to spend on cleaning. A simple 50–50 split will not do, because one person may prefer to have the kitchen or closet much cleaner than the other, so even at first glance, fair 50–50 split will not solve the question how many hours in total will have to be spent on cleaning, that is, the provision level of the public good. The LE will identify a unique level of the public good with shares assigned to each household member in such a way, that given the assigned shares, each member will choose the same (Lindahl) level of public good provision with the shares summing up to unity. However, since shares are proportional to marginal willingness to pay (WTP), household members have an incentive not to reveal their true preferences in order to easy- or free-ride on the efforts of the other.</p>
