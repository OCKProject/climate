<p id="Par2" class="p">Article 2 of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference Paris Agreement aims at limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and “Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> Contrary to the Kyoto protocol, there is no detailed country- and time-specific path to reach these goals, but instead a bottom-up approach where each country can set its own “nationally determined contributions” to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, without an enforcement mechanism. Apparently, the specifics of burden sharing is relegated to the 5-yearly periodical global stocktake specified in Article 14, starting in 2023, although Article 4 states that developed countries should make absolute reductions, against for the near future just mitigation efforts for developing countries and of mobilizing USD $100 billion per year to fund climate policies financed by the developed countries.
