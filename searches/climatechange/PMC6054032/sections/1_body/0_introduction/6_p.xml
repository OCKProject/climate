 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2008</xref>) have identified the main fairness properties of the LE. They show not only that the LE is efficient (i.e., satisfying the Samuelson condition for the optimal supply of the public good) but also that the benefit principle (described as “everyone pays what he gets”) and the axiom of proportional contributions (meaning that cost shares are proportional to marginal WTP) are satisfied. Despite these attractive properties, the neglect of the LE should not come as a surprise, since in the economic literature on burden sharing to provide a public good, the LE is said to be merely of theoretical interest, mainly for two reasons: first, the difficulty to assess objectively for each country its WTP and second, the incentive to strategically misrepresent preferences. The best illustration of the practical insignificance of the LE in the debate on climate change is that as far as we know, there is no study with an empirical simulation of the abatement burdens across countries or regions in a LE, a lacuna we hope to fill in this paper.
