<p id="Par10" class="p">The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref> presents the sub-optimal non-cooperating Nash model. Section 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref> presents the model with a social planner but without the instrument of redistribution, which, together with the Nash model, are used as benchmarks for the LE. Section 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref> identifies the LE in the global burden sharing of abatement. The empirical part is presented in Section 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref>. In the first simulation, the world is divided into two blocks of rich (Annex I) and poor (Annex II) countries; in the second, five regions are distinguished. The different burden sharing rules are evaluated by two criteria, the extent to which global abatement is optimal and the required degree of redistribution by means of transfers from rich to poor countries. The final section summaries and concludes.
