<p id="Par35" class="p">In the initial questionnaire, half of the participants mentioned who is resilient: 39.4 % indicated that a system is resilient and 8.6 % indicated that individuals or organisms are resilient. Related to ability or capacity for ‘A’, there are no apparent important differences between regions. ‘To recover’ seems to be the most important verb associated with resilience (almost 50 % of mentions), followed by ‘to adapt’ (20.7 %) and ‘to resist’ (12.6 %). This is consistent with responses related to ‘in order to’ (C), where ‘to return to an initial state’ obtained 60 % of responses. The ideas about ‘the capacity to recover’ (A) and ‘to return to an initial state’ (C) were strongest in Biobío, where the former obtained a 74.1 % and the latter obtained a 100 % of mentions. In Biobío, these results could have been influenced by the earthquake in 2010 (Mw = 8.8), where this region was epicentre, with major losses and destruction.</p>
