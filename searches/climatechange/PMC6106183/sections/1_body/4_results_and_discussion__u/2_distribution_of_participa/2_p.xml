<p id="Par32" class="p">The absence of private sector actors can be partially explained, because the perceptions of managers are that these kinds of processes require “expensive time investment with uncertain returns and at worst a risk to their perceived autonomy and independence” (Cash et al.

On the other hand, the low level of participation from civil society can be due to a lack of “territorialisation” of policies on climate change in Latin America, a process in which a global phenomenon, such as climate change, is involved in local/regional territories and linked with local policies (Blanco and Fuenzalida 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>). In the Chilean case, a lack of territorialisation of policies on climate change is observed (Blanco and Fuenzalida
