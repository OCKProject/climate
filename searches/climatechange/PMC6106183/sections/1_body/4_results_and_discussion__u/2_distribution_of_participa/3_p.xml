<p id="Par33" class="p">Related to territorial scale (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), the distribution of government agencies was balanced between local, regional, and national levels. The low presence of provincial actors is explained by the fact that in Chile, the provincial government is an administrative level with less representation than national and municipal levels. Civil society was comprised of NGOs and local organisations. The presence of more NGOs than local organisations can be explained by the fact that the NGOs are formal institutions, with clear direction, projects, leadership, and employees. In contrast, local organisations are not necessarily formally constituted and participation is voluntary. This difference, alongside the low degree of territorialisation of policies reflecting local conditions, can influence the level of participation of local organisations. In the case of the academic sector in Chile, universities have regional representation. It was not possible to sub-divide the private sector into types of participants due to the low level of participation.
