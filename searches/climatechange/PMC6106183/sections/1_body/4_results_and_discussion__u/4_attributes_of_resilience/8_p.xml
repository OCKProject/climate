<p id="Par47" class="p">‘Preparedness’, ‘education-information’, ‘decentralisation’, and ‘political will’, among others, have important implications on governance, because these concepts are closely linked to proactivity, innovation, adaptation, awareness, warning, self-management, and training, promoting local responsibility and a more balanced decision-making (Aldunce et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, they involve moving from the response or reactive resilience to proactive resilience, which some scholars argues is where societies should be moving towards (Aldunce et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2015</xref>; Handmer and Dovers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1996</xref>).
