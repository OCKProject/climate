<p id="Par44" class="p">There are no apparent differences in the selections of the most important attribute, where ‘Education-information’ emerged as the most substantial aspect. Perhaps, Metropolitan region is highlighted, because initially participants considered ‘Education-Information’ in third place, however, in the second selection, this attribute was considered as first. This change can be partly explained by the fact that in this region, 73.7 % of participants were from public sector, whose field of work is in planning and management. Therefore, the questionnaire collected individual preferences, and in general, these are associated with own ideas according to the performance area. However, in the second selection, participants dialogued with other actors about their choices, reaching the same pattern as in the other regions. As van de Kerkhof and Wieczorek (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2005</xref>) state, the transitional process of mutual learning requires that actors leave their own interests and ideas, opening their mind to other perspectives and information. Therefore, the group discussion allowed this transition between individual viewpoints to integrated ideas. This process can explain the importance of the attributes: ‘cooperation’ and ‘citizen participation’, during the second selection of attributes.
