<p id="Par42" class="p">Preparedness was the second most mentioned attribute. Chile is exposed to a range of socio-natural and natural disasters, such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, mudslides, and drought. Although earthquakes are not related to climate change, when participatory methodologies are developed, it is impossible to separate clearly different events, and disaster reduction policies in general embraces an all hazards approach. During the last earthquake and tsunami in Chile in 2010, preparedness was perceived as weak, generating a wide public discussion, which partially explains how this factor appeared relevant in workshops in Biobio and Metropolitan regions (earthquake covered the entire study area, but more intensely between Biobio and Metropolitan regions). Several studies have analysed the psychological impact of this earthquake (Gaborit

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2010</xref>) and others have studied the slow action of the state (Acevedo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2013</xref>; Romero 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2014</xref>). Uncertainty is a factor that affects psychologically due to lack of knowledge, while preparedness seeks to reduce this uncertainty (Naranjo Álvarez

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2011</xref>).
