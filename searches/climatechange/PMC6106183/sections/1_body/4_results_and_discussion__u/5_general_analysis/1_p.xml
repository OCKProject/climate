This reinforces why special attention must be given to the different understandings in knowledge co-production processes. However, regional and local aspects considered historically relevant, such as ‘decentralisation’ or ‘political will’, emerged as differentiators.

This point should not be seen as negative, but as a normal process of learning. Indeed, according to van de Kerkhof and Wieczorek (
