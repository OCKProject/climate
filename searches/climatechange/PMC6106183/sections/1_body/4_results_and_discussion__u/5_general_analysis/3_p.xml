<p id="Par50" class="p">The ethical dimension was fundamental in order to organise and perform our research. Principles included in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> were the basis of this research, because our concern was to avoid false expectations (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013a</xref>), respect different understandings (Warburton and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">1999</xref>), balance power relations between participants, and avoid treating communities as data extraction sources, called by Moodie (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>) as “helicopter research”. In our view, not only do these aspects allow for trust in the research team, which is fundamental for achieving involvement and engagement, but also they must be considered the core of researchers’ behaviour. In particular, power asymmetries were faced through individual questionnaires and discussion groups. The former allows us to have responses with the same weight/influence on the result. For discussion groups, recognising that power asymmetries cannot be fully placated, the role of facilitators was crucial. They were trained to face with it.
