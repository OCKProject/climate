<p id="Par52" class="p">In this study, we show how resilience theory can be articulated into practice, addressing 4 of the 5 “dimensions of knowledge co-production” raised by Armitage et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2011</xref>), p. 999: knowledge gathering through questionnaires; knowledge sharing through discussion groups; knowledge integration through discussion groups and plenary; and knowledge interpretation through the analysis and the discussion during the seminar of return results. In order to incorporate the knowledge application (fifth dimension), we consider that efforts for co-producing knowledge are linked to political decisions. By doing so, they have the potential first to institutionalise the process, giving support, continuity, and financing; second, it would approach territorial realities; and third, it would encourage participation and empowerment in different levels of governance.
