<p id="Par17" class="p">Based on a project protocol, each workshop was designed in seven consecutive phases:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par18" class="p">The initial questionnaire on resilience [first instrument part (a)] was completed by participants before the start of each workshop. This questionnaire sought to explore their level of knowledge of resilience.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par19" class="p">Introduction (including workshop objectives, the study process, its strengths, limitations, and scope, who were the participants, why they were invited and why they were important in the process) and a presentation on drought in Chile, trends, and impacts (contextualization).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par20" class="p">Presentation on study developed by Aldunce et al. (
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2014b</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par21" class="p">Individual questionnaire of attributes (second instrument): each participant chose 10 of 33 attributes identified by Aldunce et al. (
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2014b</xref>). This questionnaire aimed to identify the individual preferences of attributes of climate change resilience.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par22" class="p">Discussion groups (third instrument): three discussion groups, each with a facilitator, were established in each workshop. The discussion section was divided into three parts: (1) the impacts of drought in each region; (2) the attributes of climate change resilience in their regional context; and (3) the characteristics of attributes and the roles of actor for building resilience communities.</p>
   <p id="Par23" class="p">This paper focuses in the two questionnaires and the second discussion (2), where after the completion of the individual questionnaire on attributes (second instrument), each participant, supported by graphic material, chose the five most important attributes in the drought context, where all participants could see these new selections. The aim was to determine how the individual preferences changed after a dialogue with other participants.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par24" class="p">Plenary: each group explained its results.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par25" class="p">Final questionnaire on resilience [first instrument part (b)]: each participant filled the same initial questionnaire; this allowed us to trace the learning gained by participants during the workshop.</p>
