<p id="Par3" class="p">A number of arguments support the idea that expanding the participation of actors for the co-production of knowledge is valuable for sustaining resilience. For example, diversity in group composition is considered important, where participation from a diverse range of views or considerations for discussion is emphasised (Aldunce et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2011</xref>). Others orient this participation as a process where giving opportunities to share knowledge and expertise are important, recognising that all knowledge are relevant (Armitage et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2010</xref>; Thomalla and Larsen
