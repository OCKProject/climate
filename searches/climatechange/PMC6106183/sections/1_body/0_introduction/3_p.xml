<p id="Par4" class="p">Given the scale and complexity of building resilience to climate change, responses require active participation from governments, citizens, scientists, and private sectors. Nevertheless, several critiques have emerged with regard to the role that these different actors play in this participation, as for example, the role of scientists. Scientists have generated theoretical frameworks on many subjects related to climate change in order to understand and parameterise its effects, as well as people/community responses to climate change (Berrang-Ford et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, among scientists, it has accomplished little agreement on how adaptation or resilience is built, analysed, and applied in practice, incorporating different criteria and methodologies (Berrang-Ford et al.
