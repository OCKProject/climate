<p id="Par6" class="p">On the whole, integrated research accounts for the complexity inherent in real-world problems (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2008</xref>; Cornell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pohl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2010</xref>), by integrating diverse knowledge systems in the process of co-producing knowledge. These knowledge systems should not only be understood as a collection of facts, but also as diverse ways, in which people understand, interpret, and give meaning to the world based on their experiences (Blaikie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">1997</xref>; Warburton and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">1999</xref>). In this paper, our goal is to complement knowledge on how to build resilience by demonstrating with case-based evidence how theory can be articulated into practice, how knowledge co-production can enrich the research process between context, regions, and actors, and how participant inputs can be explained/contextualised. The findings are based on the results of workshops on building resilience to climate change which took place in three regions in Chile during 2014.
