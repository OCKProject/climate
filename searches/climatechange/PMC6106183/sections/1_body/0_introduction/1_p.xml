<p id="Par2" class="p">Climate change poses a great challenge to society, with urgent responses needed that contribute to building resilience and developing adaptation (Aldunce et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, building resilience first requires an understanding for the ways, in which the term is understood and articulated by diverse actors in a given situation. In resilience frameworks, key elements have been described for building resilience in the context of a changing climate. These emphasise the importance of participatory processes and the co-production of knowledge, and the participation of stakeholders and decision makers, but with a little grounded validation. The purpose of this study was to address this gap, exploring how resilience theory can be applied and articulated into practice through the participatory approaches as a means to incorporate and ‘co-produce’ knowledge.
