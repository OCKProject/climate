<p id="Par9" class="p">From a transdisciplinary perspective, moving from theory to practice through the co-production of knowledge involves the development of “empirical and practice-oriented knowledge than can help solve, mitigate or prevent life-world problems” (Pohl and Hirsch Hadorn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2007</xref>, p. 26). Thus, based on the conceptualization that “knowledge is a precondition for learning”, co-production of knowledge can be seen as a mechanism which enables learning, where five process dimensions play a role: “(1) knowledge gathering, (2) knowledge sharing, (3) knowledge integration, (4) knowledge interpretation, and (5) knowledge application” (Armitage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2011</xref>, p. 998). Consequently, this type of research addresses socially relevant problems through “contextualised knowledge”, a concept coined by Gibbons (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1999</xref>, C82) to explain the outcome of a mutual transformation between science and society. This includes reverse communication flows, where scientists seek socially robust knowledge, beyond scientific certainty, recognising that changes involve a complex interaction and feedback into socio-ecological systems over temporal and spatial scales (Gibbons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1999</xref>; Cornell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>).
