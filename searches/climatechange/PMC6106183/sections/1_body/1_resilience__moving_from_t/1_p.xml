 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2007</xref>). Literature on resilience specific to climate change includes a wide range of definitions and characteristics of resilience building (Aldunce et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2013</xref>), this diversity in conceptualisations is considered a weakness of the approach. However, we argue instead that this diversity is positive, because it gives flexibility which can be applied to different contexts and is part of the complexity inherent in the real world. Moreover, we believe that this diversity can be addressed through the transdisciplinary approaches that account for this complexity, because resilience cannot be reduced or simplified to one single perspective.
