<p id="Par13" class="p">Chile has a diverse climate and topography, where precipitation deficit counts as one of the most important effects of climate change in this country (Meza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). For these reasons, our study focused on drought as characterised by its slow onset, gradual impacts, cumulative effects, and conditional sensitivity to the context, in which it manifests. Therefore, it is important to highlight different effects that drought has on lifestyles, productive systems, and ecosystems due to the dependency to rainfall and/or water flows in the basis (freshwater, irrigation, energy production, and others) in different regions of Chile (Meza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). According to Garreaud (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2011</xref>), the projected changes in Chile between 2070 and 2100 (under A2 scenario—worst case—, using the PRECIS‐DGF model) show that precipitations on Los Ríos and Biobío Region would decline strongly (a reduction of 60–70 % from the climatic baseline 1960–1990), and in Metropolitan region, precipitations would decrease between 15 and 30 %.
