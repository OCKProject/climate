<p id="Par62" class="p">From emerged results, key lessons can be considered for policy makers and society. First, when efforts for building resilience are made, understanding resilience as an ability or capacity gives the opportunity to focus on socio-ecological aspects. Second, the framing of resilience as a capacity not only ‘to recovering’, but also ‘to adapt’, ‘to learn’, ‘to transform’, and ‘to re-organise’, opens up opportunities to move towards continually improved systems. Third, equitable/universal access to information and education and to enhance preparedness emerged as key for building resilience, especially in countries frequently exposed to disasters related to climatic hazards.</p>
