Furthermore, we consider that an explicit link to political decisions and context could facilitate institutionalised continuity and financial prioritisation; however, this remains to be affirmed through follow-up studies on ex-post policy evaluations. In our case, contextualisation to local realities could also empower processes to facilitate more meaningful decentralisation of decisions as a political process. In the Chilean context, these seem to be key points of consideration in the development of this kind of work. Many challenges remain, including how to generate regular dialogue and engagement between science, government, and society, where scientists assume part of the responsibility for transformation and engagement as an actor (at the same level of the others), making their own research open to public scrutiny, and to develop transdisciplinary work in order to enrich the research process and contextualise it.</p>
