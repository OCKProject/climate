 <xref rid="bib0480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2012)</xref>. Raising the upper limit of genetic yield potential through traditional plant breeding has remained very successful, for example, increasing wheat yields by using gene encoding for the dwarfing of plants in the Green Revolution (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et al., 2009</xref>). However, the rate of success of the traditional plant breeding, which is generally defined as “selection for yield”, is heavily dependent on the availability of a wide range of parents, the choice of the crosses to be made and the skilful evaluation of the emergent genotypes, together with one’s share of good fortune (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donald, 1968</xref>). Conventional breeding is constrained by time and resources and is, thus, less efficient in terms of progress achieved, as desirable traits come mostly by chance without the underlying physiology being fully understood (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fischer, 2007</xref>). Breeding for new cultivars of high yield potential in a target environment, such as future climate change, is a different and challenging task for plant breeders as a) understanding the physiological basis of yield potential in a changing environment is required, b) selection of desirable traits and their exact combinations for future improvements is difficult, and c) reproducing future climatic conditions for evaluation of the performance of a new cultivar is difficult. Designing crop ideotypes based on the state-of-the-art knowledge in crop physiology and assessment of their performances in the target environment beforehand could help in breeding crops for high yield potential under climate change. 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donald (1968)</xref> first proposed the idea of ‘breeding of crop ideotypes’, in which breeders select plant ideotypes based on their knowledge of crop physiology for improvement of plant traits in the target environment, and then breed for them. A crop ideotype is a virtual idealized crop, or a crop model, that is expected to produce a greater quality and quantity of grain yield when developed as a cultivar. Designing crop ideotypes

 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2017</xref>). Crop modelling is the most powerful tool for designing such crop ideotypes in target environments. Crop models (a) are efficient in designing crop ideotypes in terms of time and resources, (b) help in selecting optimal combinations of target traits when considering possible trade-offs between them, (c) assess performance of potential candidates across target environments, (d) assist in deconvoluting complex traits, such as crop yield, to a list of simpler component traits suitable for further analysis and improvement (
