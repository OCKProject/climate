<p id="par0135" class="p">The mean simulated anthesis date of 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> under baseline-climate was 26-June in the UK (250 DAS–days after sowing) and 15-November in NZ (209-DAS) (
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Mean anthesis date of 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> was around 11-days earlier under 2050-climate in both countries. In contrary, mean anthesis date of 
 <italic class="italic">IW
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> was 31-days earlier than 
 <italic class="italic">CL
  <sub class="sub">Base</sub>
 </italic> in the UK, but delayed by 15-days in NZ. Average anthesis date of 
 <italic class="italic">IP
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> delayed by about 2-days compared to 
 <italic class="italic">IW
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> in the UK, but remained almost the same in NZ. The mean anthesis date of 
 <italic class="italic">CL
  <sub class="sub">Base</sub>
 </italic> was 41-days earlier in NZ than in the UK, but delayed by 5- and 3-days for 
 <italic class="italic">IW
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">IP
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> respectively. The optimized cultivar parameter Phyllochron 
 <italic class="italic">P
  <sub class="sub">h</sub>
 </italic> increased to its maximum permissible value 120 °C day set in the optimization procedure for both the ideotypes in the UK and NZ (
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, optimized mean day length response 
 <italic class="italic">P
  <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 </italic> decreased by 74–81% in the UK, but increased by 55–60% in NZ for both the ideotypes.
