 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic>, used in our study, were 10.8 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the UK and 13.2 t ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in NZ under the baseline (1980–2010) climatic condition, which is 2.6–3.4 times greater than the global average wheat yield of 3 t ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAOSTAT, 2018</xref>). High winter wheat yield in the UK and NZ could be linked to low air temperature (9–15 °C) and sufficient precipitation (596–1296 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), with very few or almost no extreme climatic events and abiotic stresses (e.g., heat and drought stresses), which ensure slow growth and longer crop maturity (237–317 days). These results in greater cumulative intercepted solar radiation over the growing season, and higher total crop biomass and grain yields in these two high-latitude (56 °N–46 °S) countries. For similar reasons, the highest wheat productive countries are generally lie at high latitudes, for examples, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, including NZ and the UK (

 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hawkesford et al., 2013</xref>). The mean simulated wheat yields in our study are 39–57% greater than the national averages of the UK and NZ (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAOSTAT, 2018</xref>). This could be explained by our assumptions about agronomic management practices that are effective in meeting the N demand and achieving full control of any weed, disease and pest infestations, factors that may reduce the national mean wheat yield. The mean baseline wheat yields in the present study are close to good year wheat yields (8–14 t ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) as reported by various studies across the UK and NZ (
