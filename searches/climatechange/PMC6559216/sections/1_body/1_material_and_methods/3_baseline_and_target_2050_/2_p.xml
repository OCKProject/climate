<p id="par0055" class="p">30-years (1980–2010) of daily observed weather data at each study site were used for estimating site parameters for the baseline climate. To assess inter-annual variation in crop production in the baseline climate, a stochastic weather generator (

 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) was used to generate 100 years of daily weather data at each site using the baseline site parameters, hereafter defined as ‘baseline-climate’, or the ‘current-climate’, with an atmospheric CO
