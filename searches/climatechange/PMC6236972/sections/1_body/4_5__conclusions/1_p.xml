<p class="p">In low- and middle-income countries, there are very few heat action plans and there is a lack of evidence of their effectiveness. Our study is one of the first to offer such evidence and suggests that the Ahmedabad intervention reduced mortality in its first two years, particularly at higher temperatures. Our results indicate that that heat action plans may be effective in protecting vulnerable populations in tropical latitudes, where the effect of climate change could be very severe on economically disadvantaged communities in crowded cities. While more research is needed, the results of this evaluation may encourage other cities and countries to develop similar efforts to reduce current risks and advance climate change adaptation.</p>
