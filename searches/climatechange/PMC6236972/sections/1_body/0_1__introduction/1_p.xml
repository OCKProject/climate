<p class="p">The dangers of extreme heat to health are extensively documented [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Globally, extreme heat events have become more frequent and intense over recent decades [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and several extreme heat events have been fully attributed to climate change [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. These trends are expected to accelerate, with an average projected global temperature increase of at least 0.2°C per decade by 2030 and as much as 4.8°C by the end of the century relative to a 1986–2005 baseline without aggressive mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. There is high confidence that this warming may have significant adverse health impacts [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and that various preparedness strategies and early warning systems will need to be a part of climate change adaptation planning [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In many instances, heat is already a threat to health, and current efforts to promote resilience to extreme heat can facilitate climate change adaptation [
