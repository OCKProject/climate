<p class="p">To generate estimates of absolute risk and feed into calculations of potential mortality avoided after HAP implementation, we also performed an analysis of daily mortality incidence for different heat alert categories. To generate crude incidence rate (IR) estimates, we used daily mortality count data and annual estimated population data to calculate IRs for each summer day in 2007–2010 and 2014–2015 using Excel. We stratified estimates by

 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, grouping estimates by heat alert category (i.e., any alert and yellow, orange, or red alert, respectively) as described above. We used the Mann–Whitney

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values for differences between IRs. We also calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing 2014 with 2010 and calculated 95% confidence intervals for both IRs and IRRs using methods described in Rothman et al. [
