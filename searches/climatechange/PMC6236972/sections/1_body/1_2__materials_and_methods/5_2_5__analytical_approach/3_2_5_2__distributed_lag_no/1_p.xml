<p class="p">To estimate changes in relative risk of mortality associated with heat exposure, we used the

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> at lags up to 5 days, estimating mortality rates for each temperature relative to rates at 40°C. We derived the model using 2007–10 data and then applied the same model to data from 2014 to 2015. A priori, we modeled the cross-basis function for temperature as natural cubic spline with 5 knots, two in the boundaries and remaining knots at 40°C, 42°C and 45°C, respectively. We used 3 equally spaced knots in the log-scale as the lag response function over lags 0–5. In the distributed lag model, we used continuous

 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, but for ease of comparison between our pre- and post-HAP years, we calculated the RR of mortality at each whole number

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and across lag structures for each year. We used contour plots comparing the lagged temperature-mortality relationships to identify the most appropriate lag structures for subsequent analyses described below.
