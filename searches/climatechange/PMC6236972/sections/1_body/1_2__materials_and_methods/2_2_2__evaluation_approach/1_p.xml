<p class="p">Data were collected in 2016 and analyzed from 2016 to 2018. We chose to use 2007–2010 as the baseline period and 2014–2015 as the postintervention period because HAP planning and implementation occurred from 2011 to 2013, with full implementation starting in 2014. Given Ahmedabad's rapid growth, we determined that a short baseline would be more comparable and a longer baseline period would result in many unmeasured factors that might be less comparable. We used temperature, mortality, and population data (described below) to analyze how the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and all-cause mortality changed after the HAP was implemented. We performed a descriptive analysis of daily 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> distributions before and after the HAP to compare the respective heat seasons. We conducted a distributed lag analysis of the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and all-cause mortality to evaluate how relative risk lag structures changed after the intervention. To incorporate changes related to population growth, we calculated mortality incidence using year-specific population estimates for all days with forecasted 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over 40°C (i.e., any heat alert) and for specific heat alert strata (i.e., yellow, orange, and red alert days, respectively). Using these results, we used pre-HAP IRs to calculate expected post-HAP mortality and compared this with observed mortality for days with forecasted 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over 40°C to calculate a postintervention mortality difference.
