<p class="p">The AMC assembles daily mortality data for the city using death reports from hospitals, crematoria, burial grounds, and other sources. Death registration and a death certificate are required prior to cremation or burial. The data from all sources are compiled by the AMC Registrar of Births and Deaths within three weeks and typically finalized within several months. We obtained daily death data for each year in the study period from Registrar of Births and Deaths office of AMC.</p>
