<p class="p">India performs a population census every decade; the last census occurred in 2011. Ahmedabad city's 2011 population was 5,577,940, and its 2001 population was 3,520,085 [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We used these two census counts and assumed compounding growth [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] to calculate a compound average annual growth rate of 4.71%. This growth rate and the 2001 and 2011 census counts were used to interpolate annual population estimates. This rate was used to generate population estimates for the intercensal years during the study period. Population estimates were 4,639,867 for 2007, 4,858,449 for 2008, 5,087,328 for 2009, 5,326,989 for 2010, 6,403,981 for 2014, and 6,705,669 for 2015.
