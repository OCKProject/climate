<p class="p">Another ecological study of mortality and temperature, comparing two summers in Shanghai (1998 and 2003), found similar results, though the mortality reduction was less dramatic than that observed for Paris [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The authors generated a statistical model controlling for the effects of air pollution and temperature variation between the two years and observed fewer deaths during the 2003 heat wave, with an absolute reduction in mortality of approximately 29%. This reduction is slightly higher than we observed. The study authors concluded that the reduction likely resulted from the introduction of an early warning system, improved living conditions, and greater access to air conditioning [
