<p class="p">With all of these caveats in mind, we note that our findings are consistent with evaluations of similar heat preparedness initiatives adopted in other countries. Fouillet et al. compared the observed and expected mortalities during the 2006 heat wave in Europe based on heat wave of the summer of 2003 [

The authors concluded that the mortality reduction could be due to increased public awareness, the promotion of preventive measures, and the establishment of an early warning system [
