<p class="p">The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the findings depend on inclusion of data from 2010. This is likely because there were relatively few very hot days in the pre-HAP period from which exposure-outcome associations could be derived, limiting statistical power to detect a difference. Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that, as noted above, other factors may have confounded the relationships observed between temperature and mortality in 2010.</p>
