<p class="p">Ahmedabad's heat action plan, as detailed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], includes a suite of educational and other interventions, including a heat early warning system, that were new to the city and its population. The plan's messaging encourages the population to avoid heat exposure, maintain appropriate levels of hydration, and outlines strategies for cooling when becoming overheated. When heat warnings are triggered, a number of other activities occur, including actions to increase preparedness in the prehospital setting, clinics, and hospital emergency departments. Combined, these messages and activities may have reduced exposure and limited heat-related morbidity and mortality and may be a driver of the observed mortality reduction.
