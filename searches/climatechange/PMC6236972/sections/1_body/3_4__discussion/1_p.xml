<p class="p">Using two different approaches, we found a decrease in all-cause mortality in the first two years (2014–2015) after the HAP was implemented. The findings of this ecological study suggest that the HAP was associated with reduced mortality during the 2014–2015 heat seasons, particularly at higher temperatures. The maximum pre-HAP RR was 2.34 (95% CI 1.98–2.76) at 47°C (lag 0), and the maximum post-HAP RR was 1.25 (1.02–1.53) estimated at 47°C (lag 0). Post-to-pre-HAP nonlagged mortality IRR for

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over 45°C. An estimated 2,380 (95% CI 324–4,435) deaths were avoided in the post-HAP period. Temperatures and HAP warning days post-HAP implementation were associated with decreased summertime all-cause mortality rates, with the largest declines at the highest temperatures.
