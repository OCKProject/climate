<p class="p">Our findings suggest that the Ahmedabad HAP protected health against mortality associated with extreme heat. Our ecological study design is limited and potentially subject to a number of biases, and we did not control for potential confounders including heat wave timing and air quality. An alternate design controlling for these factors and comparing associations between temperature and mortality in Ahmedabad and another city would add strength to the conclusions here, and additional research in Ahmedabad is ongoing. Furthermore, the analysis is limited by the small sample of very hot days across post-HAP study years (2014–2015) versus the baseline years (2007–2010), making it difficult to parse the data by including all other variables (e.g., day of week and changing age structure of municipal population) to find a significant HAP effect signal, even if additional data are available. That said, our pilot findings are consistent with recent reviews of heat action plans [
