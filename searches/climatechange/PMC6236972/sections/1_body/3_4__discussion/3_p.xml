<p class="p">While encouraging, the findings should be interpreted with some caution, as other factors including heat wave timing and unmeasured factors may have affected the findings and several potential biases and confounders including air pollution were not controlled for in our analysis. Thus, we are not able to completely rule out other possible reasons for these findings. Population resilience to extreme heat may have increased for reasons unrelated to the heat action plan, for example, in response to publicity related to the 2010 heat wave. Alternatively, differences in the population or its exposure to ambient temperatures may be responsible. In 2010, for instance, the hottest days of the heat wave occurred slightly earlier in the season, when population susceptibility has been observed in Europe and North America to be approximately twice as high as later in the summer [

It is possible that the observed temperature-mortality associations were affected by other unmeasured factors, such as infectious disease outbreaks at certain points, though, as noted in our previous analysis of the 2010 heat wave, the principle source of data for pre-HAP exposure at very high temperatures, no such exposures were detected [

Demographic shifts or changes in living conditions (e.g., the prevalence of air conditioning, evaporative cooling, or crowded housing conditions) between the two periods may also have reduced underlying risk associated with temperature. Unfortunately, more granular data regarding population composition and changes over time are unavailable. Lastly, air pollution, an unmeasured potential confounder, may have had a role. Some work suggests that failure to control for ozone and particulates can result in an overestimation of heat-related mortality [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. It is possible that Ahmedabad's air quality improved from 2007 to 2015 and that this drove some of the reduction, though such a reduction would have come during a period of rapid urban and industrial growth. Unfortunately, there are no air quality data to introduce as a control in our model.
