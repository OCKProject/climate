 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and has worked to scale up heat early warning systems and action plans to 11 states and 30 cities in India, with several new HAPs being developed or now in place [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The Ahmedabad HAP, as well as the Indian government's scale-up effort, can serve as models for neighboring South Asian countries interested in increasing resilience to extreme heat.
