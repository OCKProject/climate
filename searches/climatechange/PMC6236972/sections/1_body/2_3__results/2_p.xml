<p class="p">The results of the distributed lag nonlinear model (dlnm) analysis are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, which depicts the nonlagged, for example, lag 0, RR of mortality across the daily temperature strata for each year. The largest effect was seen at lag 0 for both years. Before HAP, the RR of mortality increased monotonically over 40°C with maximum effect (RR of 2.34; 95% CI 1.98–2.76) at 47°C, lag 0. After HAP, the RR also increased monotonically over 40°C, but with a substantially lower maximum effect (RR of 1.25; 1.02–1.53) estimated at 47°C, lag 0. Nonlagged estimates were used for the remaining analyses.
