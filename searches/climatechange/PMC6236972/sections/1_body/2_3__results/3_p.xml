<p class="p">The results of the stratum-specific IRs for each period are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. IRs for both the pre- and post-HAP periods for each temperature category (i.e., any alert and yellow, orange, and red alerts, respectively) are presented. Consistent with the analysis of RR associated with extreme heat, mortality incidence was highest during the warmest periods, and there was a dose-response relationship observed in each period. After HAP, we observed a reduction in all-cause mortality incidence on all warning days during the post-HAP period, including days with any warning and days with yellow, orange, and red warnings, respectively. IRRs varied inversely with temperature, indicating the largest risk reduction on the hottest days. None of the differences were statistically significant.
