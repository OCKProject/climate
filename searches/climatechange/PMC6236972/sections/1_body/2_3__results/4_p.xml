 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> contains results from the expected mortality analysis. The counts of post-HAP days are presented for each category. Based on reductions in temperature-specific mortality incidence, an estimated 2,380 (95% CI 324–4,435) deaths were avoided in the post-HAP period, or an estimated 1,190 (95% CI 162–2,218) average annualized deaths avoided post-HAP.
