<p id="Par29" class="p">After identifying a representative slope of the treeline ecotone in the mountain chain and checking from historical information and local people the absence of any relevant anthropogenic influence, a grid composed by 3 vertical (altitudinal) and 4 horizontal (at the same elevation) transects, at a distance of 50 m each, was drawn and placed on a georeferenced satellite map of the area in order to include the whole ecotone from the timberline, through treeline, to the isolated and highest individual trees of the tree species line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), whose definitions are conventions for communication and do not deserve a major scientific debate

 </sup>. This sampling frame was subdivided in a 5 × 5 m grid in order to collect landscape data from the areas included in the frame but excluded from the sampling transects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The coordinates of each transect and corners of the sampling frame were recorded with a 2-m precision.
