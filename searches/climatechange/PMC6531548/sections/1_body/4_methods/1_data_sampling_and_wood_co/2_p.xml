<p id="Par30" class="p">Along each transect all trees with a diameter at the breast height (d.b.h.) &gt;1 cm were identified at the species level, measured with a laser hypsometer-dendrometer (height, dbh and crown width) and georeferenced within the sampling grid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Seedlings and saplings of trees (below the minimum height of 1.35 m and d.b.h. of 1 cm) were not measured but have been mapped and included in the category “Trees” (which represents all the non-sampled trees outside the transects) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The coverage of the other vegetation composed by shrub and herb species (identified at the genus level) and of the main landscape features (big rocks and landslide areas) included in the sampling frame among transects was visually estimated and georeferenced within each cell of the grid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
