We performed a validation by calibrating climate data from a sub-period by dividing the data into two parts: 1956–1978 and 1979–2009) and verifying the reconstruction using the remaining data. The results were evaluated by the correlation coefficient (r), the sign test (ST), the reduction of error test (RE), the coefficient of efficiency (CE) and the product means test (t) during the verification period. The actual and estimated data in year i of the verification period and the mean of the actual data in the calibration and verification periods were compared to calculate the sign of RE and CE following refs
