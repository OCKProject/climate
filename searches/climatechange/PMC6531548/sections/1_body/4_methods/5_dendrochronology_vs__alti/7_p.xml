<p id="Par54" class="p">Therefore, to derive linear equations that would allow an estimation of the temperature during the missing years of observation from our dendrochronological time series, we divided the temperature-growth plot in two subplots (at −4.3 °C threshold). The parameter from the linear regression equation derived from the data points at a temperature &lt;−4.3 °C were used to estimate the temperature for the period 1902–1955 (because of we show that the temperature was always below −4.3 °C before 1978) and those derived from the data points at a temperature &gt;−4.3 °C were used to estimate the temperature for the period 2010–2017 (because the data points &gt;−4.3 °C exclusively represents most of the growth trends after 1978).</p>
