<p id="Par53" class="p">The mean annual temperature variability was correlated with the mean annual growth variability and a generalized linear model (quadratic function) was used to describe the relationship. Because the trend resulted in an almost hyperbolic curve (quadratic function), we inspected in any factor related to the predictor variable (temperature) could have influenced it. We discovered that a threshold of −4.3 °C was never passed before the 1978 and that this temperature approximately represents the turning point (close to the minimum point x = −b/2a of the eq.
