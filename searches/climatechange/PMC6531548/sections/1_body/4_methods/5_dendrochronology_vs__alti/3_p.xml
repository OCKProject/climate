<p id="Par50" class="p">To disentangle the curvilinear relationship between the mean annual growth and the year of tree birth, we analyzed the growth trends at the rarefied minimum age of all our core samples (12 years). In this way, we were able to compare the growth of the trees grouped per current age and altitude (4 groups at 2,150, 2,200, 2,250, 2,300 m a.s.l.) during their “youth”, in their first 12 years of life and to evaluate their growth variability.</p>
