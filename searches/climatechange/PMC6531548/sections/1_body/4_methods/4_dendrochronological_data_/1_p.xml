<p id="Par35" class="p">The 48 wood cores collected were prepared following the common dendrochronological protocols and measured with a LINTAB measuring table with an accuracy of 0.01 mm, equipped with a Leica MS5 stereoscope. The tree-ring growth series were then visually (TSAPwin software, version 0.53
