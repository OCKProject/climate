<p id="Par47" class="p">We used a fixed block length of 1 to account for each lag of the time series and the results show a bias of −0.32 and a very low standard error of 0.06. We then plotted the histogram of the block bootstrapping method (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>), which shows that the mean difference of bootstrapping is well below the observed difference (dashed vertical line) in the time series of the mean annual growth (with the calculated bias of −0.32). The Q-Q plot of the 500 random bootstrapping with replacement shows that our time series has a normal distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>).
