<p id="Par39" class="p">We also checked if a suitable nonlinear model could not be fitted (function is non-decreasing or some values are not positive) and we fitted a linear model. The “Mean” approach fits a horizontal line using the mean of the series. This method is the fallback solution in cases where the “Spline” or the linear fit (also a fallback solution itself) contains zeros or negative values, which would lead to invalid ring-width indices.</p>
