<p id="Par28" class="p">In conclusion, based on 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> treeline data and a dendrochronological analysis, we found an accelerating upward shift of treeline on a high-mountain vegetation ecotone until recently and a declining tree growth rate in this ecotone that are attributable to an increase in local air temperature in the past century. Our findings provide evidence of substantial ecological impacts of global climate change in high-mountain regions. Our study suggests that climate change, if left unabated, can cause dramatic changes in the structure, diversity, and landscape composition of high-mountain ecosystems such as the Altai Mountains.
