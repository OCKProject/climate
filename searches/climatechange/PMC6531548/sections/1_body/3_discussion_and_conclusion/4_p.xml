<p id="Par23" class="p">We also checked whether last-century temperature increase would have contributed to the shift of the treeline ecotone to higher altitudes. We showed that trees have actually had an accelerating upward movement during the last century, yet a recent slight downward movement. In fact, during the last 115 years, the “residence time” (intended as the years before the next 50-m upward shift) at an altitude of 2,150 m a.s.l. was approx. 52 years (from 1902 to 1954), then trees moved upward at about 2,200 m a.s.l. and kept growing at that elevation for approx. 34 years (from 1965 to 1999). Only from 1996 to 2006 (with a residence time of just 10 years) trees began growing at 2,250 m a.s.l. Some trees, between 1994 and 2002, reached even higher elevations and established at about 2,300 m a.s.l. (with a residence time at that altitude of only 8 years). This general trend in the upward shift of the treeline ecotone was relatively fast: after 1954, it took only 52 years for trees to move 150 m upward, whereas treeline “resided” for almost the same timespan (≈52 ys or even longer) at a lower elevation of 2,150 m a.s.l. Moreover, we did not find any tree born after 2002 established at the highest elevation point (2,300 m a.s.l.). The youngest sampled tree (which was born in 2006) resided 50 m below, which suggests a recent slight downward movement of the treeline likely due to the decrease of mean annual temperatures we detected for the last few years.</p>
