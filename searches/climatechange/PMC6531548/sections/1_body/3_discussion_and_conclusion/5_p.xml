<p id="Par24" class="p">Our finding that young trees (approx. 17–19 years old, sampled at the higher altitudes) grow less than old trees (93 ± 25.21 years old, sampled at lower elevations), during their first 12 years of life, confirms a reduced tree growth at higher temperatures in the high-mountains

 </sup>. In summary, this evidence suggests that the temperature increase during the past century may pose a double effect on mountain forests: in our study-site, tree growth decreased in recent years and the treeline ecotone moved 150 m upward in just about 50 years (after the 1960s), with a slight downward shift during the last decade (after 2000s).
