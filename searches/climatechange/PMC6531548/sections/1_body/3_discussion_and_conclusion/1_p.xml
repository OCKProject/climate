 </sup>, we found that the increase of temperature during the last century of climate change has led to an alteration of the tree growth trend and an upward shift until recently of the treeline in a remote preserved forest at the Aktru Research Station in the Altai Mountains. This can be attributed to the fact that areas with a harsh growing condition for woody species, previously covered by snow for most of the year, would become suitable for tree growth as the mean annual temperature increases, thus enabling a upward shift and expansion of the treeline ecotone
