<p id="Par12" class="p">As expected, we found a significant decline in tree size towards higher altitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In particular, tree height had the highest negative correlation with the altitude (Spearman’s rank correlation ρ = −0.76, P &lt; 0.01), followed by the crown width (ρ = −0.66, P &lt; 0.01) and d.b.h. (ρ = −0.54, P &lt; 0.01). No trees higher than 6 m where found over 2250 m a.s.l., even though a few relatively tall trees (7–9 m) were able to live at an altitude of 2240–2250 m a.s.l.
