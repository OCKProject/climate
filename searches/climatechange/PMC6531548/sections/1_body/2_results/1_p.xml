<p id="Par11" class="p">The densest timberline in the study site, composed by two species (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus siberica</italic> 50–60%, 
 <italic class="italic">Larix siberica</italic> 40–50%), is located up to an altitude of ≈2150 m a.s.l. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Above this level (approximately between 2150 and 2250 m a.s.l.), a treeline composed of sparse groups of trees (belonging to the same two species of the treeline) and shrubs (mostly of 
 <italic class="italic">Juniper spp</italic>., 
 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium spp</italic>. and 
 <italic class="italic">Ribes spp</italic>.) were detected. From 2250 m up to 2300 m a.s.l., only isolated trees and herb-rich meadows were identified (tree species line). No trees or shrubs with a d.b.h. &gt;1 cm (see methods) were detected above ≈2300 m a.s.l. A few landslides and groups of rocks were located on the northern side of the treeline area. The whole study site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) from 2150 m to 2300 m a.s.l. may be defined, according to the common scientific convention
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
