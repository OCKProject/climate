 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), the detrended curves (Spline and Friedman’s Super Smoother in comparison with Straight and Horizontal Lines) show similar peaks with respect to the raw curve (in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and a general decreasing growth trend, as confirmed by the Mann-Kendall statistics (τ = −0.315, P &lt; 0.01).
