<p id="Par16" class="p">To determine if the shape of the mean annual growth curve were a simple biological artifact or related to the changes in climatic conditions and establishment altitude, we compared only the first 12 years of growth of all sampled trees (e.g. we compared the first 12-years mean growth of trees born in 1900s vs. 1980s vs. 2000s). We show (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, right plot) that the oldest trees (which are located, on average, at the lowest altitude on the treeline ecotone at ≈2150 m a.s.l.) grew more than mid-age and younger trees (located at medium [≈2200 m a.s.l.] and higher [2250–2300 m a.s.l.] altitudes, respectively).
