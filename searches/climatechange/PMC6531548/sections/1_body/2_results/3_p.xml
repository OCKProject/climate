<p id="Par13" class="p">The dendrochronological analyses of the 48 wood cores collected from different altitudes along the transect of the treeline ecotone, shows a slightly declining mean annual growth curve between 1902 and 2017, with some periods (1902–1904, 1914–1916, 1923, 1928–1932, 1952–1956, 1961–1962, 1968) that peaks above the annual average tendency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). However, no relevant peaks are detected after the year 1968 (i.e. during the last 50 years of the dendrochronology).
