 </sup> and our dendrochronological time-series (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>), we discovered that before 1978 the regional mean annual temperature remained below −4.3 °C. This threshold was, therefore, used to interpret the behavior of the hyperbolic curve (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> upper-left panel) that emerged from the relationship between the mean annual growth and mean annual temperature (R

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.59; 4.3°C positive, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.39), which allow an easier estimation of the missing annual temperature records (before 1956 and after 2009) to fill the gap of the available data in the literature for the area. The only long temperature record
