<p id="Par18" class="p">The estimation for the years 1902–1955 (derived from the linear regression equation at &lt;−4 °C) shows that temperature ranged between −5 °C and −10 °C, with some lower peaks between 1952–1955, 1926–1928, 1914–1916 and 1902–1904. The estimation for the years 2010–2017, shows a slight decreasing temperature trend, with a drop of 5–10 °C in the recent years (Fig.
