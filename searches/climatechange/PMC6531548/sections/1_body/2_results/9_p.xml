<p id="Par19" class="p">The results of the split sample test showed that the correlation coefficient and the product means for all calibration and verification periods were significant at P &lt; 0.01 level. The sign tests were statistically significant in calibration and in the verification periods from 1956 and 1978 and from 1979 to 2009 at P &lt; 0.05 level. The values of RE (0.86 and 0.77, respectively) and CE (0.32 and 0.36, respectively) were always positive, indicating that the regression was stable and reliable.</p>
