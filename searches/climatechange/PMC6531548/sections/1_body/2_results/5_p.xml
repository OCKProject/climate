<p id="Par15" class="p">Tree basal area shows an expected significant negative correlation with both the year of birth of the trees (Kendall’s rank correlation τ = −0.72, P &lt; 0.01; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) and the altitude (τ = −0.69, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, mean annual growth is not significantly influenced by the altitude (τ = −0.23, P = 0.30; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) and shows a hump-shaped tendency when plotted against the birth year of trees (quadratic function, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.42). In fact, the groups of the oldest and youngest trees show a similar mean annual growth, which is lower than that of mid-age trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The positive-saturating relationship between the altitude and the birth year of trees (quadratic function, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.85) shows detectable shifts as schematized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, where we find strong evidence that trees born before 1954 do not grow above 2,150 m and trees born before 1999 do not grow above 2,200 m a.s.l. The maximum altitude of 2,300 m a.s.l. was reached between 1994 and 2002, while after 2002 the youngest trees sampled (born around 2006) grow at a lower altitude of 2,250 m a.s.l. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>).
