 </sup>. However, for most remote areas especially in the Altai Mountains, especially in the Russian part, the absence of aerial photographs combined with a lack of satellite images before the 1980s has impeded an understanding of the effects of climate change on treeline. In particular, for the Russian Altai Mountains, only scarce and sporadic climatic observations are available before the mid-1900s and historical photographic documentation (in terms of both ground/aerial pictures and satellite images) are scarce.
