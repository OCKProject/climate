<p id="Par9" class="p">The Aktru Research Station is located in the Southeastern Altai Republic (Russia) close to the borders of Mongolia and China in the Central Eurasian Continent (50°06′03″N, 87°40′14″E). With an altitude of 2100 m a.s.l., the station is situated in the high alpine range of these mountains. There are no major anthropogenic disturbances on the surrounding ecosystems and vegetation, since the area is located in a very remote (with a 3-day drive from the closest airport) and a high-altitude part of the Asian continent. The nearest settlement (Kuray, a small village) is located downstream from the station at about 30 km southeast and the nearest town is Gorno-Altaisk, about 250 km northwest of the station. The Aktru Research Station was founded in 1956 by V.M. Tronov and has been in operation until today under the supervision of Tomsk State University. There is no evidence or documentation on any type of logging, big herbivore (wild or domesticated) grazing, or fire-related impact, at least for the last 50 years, on the vegetation of the mountainside where our study site is situated.</p>
