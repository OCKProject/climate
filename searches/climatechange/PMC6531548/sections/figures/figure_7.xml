  <p class="p">Left: a schematic representation of the distribution of ages at different altitudes. The age-range is shown in each “elevation band” and a time difference (Δ), as a residence time at a specific altitude, in upward or downward shift is reported. Arrows indicate the general tendency in treeline movement. Right: boxplot of the growth, during their first 12 years of life, of trees located at different altitudes at the treeline ecotone.</p>
