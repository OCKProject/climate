  <p class="p">A 3-D model (built by meshing 10 aerial photographs taken by a drone) of the study site on the mountains slope above the Aktru Research Station in the Altai Mountains of Russia (small inset). The model is overlaid on the most recent available (2017) satellite image of the area to show the sampling scheme composed of three vertical and four horizontal transects, placed at a 50-m distance. The geographic coordinates at the corner of the study sites and the altitudes are shown. The smaller inset shows the continuous forest belt between the Severo-Chuyskiy Mountain Chain (white mountaintops on the left) and the Kuray Valley (sandy terrain on the right). The highest altitudinal treeline level is reached at the study site (red arrow) of the Aktru Research Station (inset orientation is the same as the larger satellite image; map data of the inset: Google Earth, Landsat/Copernicus, CNES/Airbus, Digital Globe). The original satellite imagery, obtained from Google Earth ProÂ© version 7.3.2.5491 (
