  <p class="p">The complete dendrochronological curve calculated as the mean annual growth from the 48 wood core samples collected along the altitudinal transects. The years for the relevant peaks are indicated above the high growth points. The dashed line represents the linear tendency and buffers the standard deviation (detailed statistical analysis in Fig.Â 
   <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In the inset, the tree ring index calculated accounting for the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions is shown as a time series (blue line) and plotted together with the number of collected samples (red line) against the increasing years (in abscissa).
