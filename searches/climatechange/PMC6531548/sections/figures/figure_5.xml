  <p class="p">The raw time-series (highest plot) is detrended and standardized by five methods. The detrended curve shown accounts for the tree’s natural biological growth trend. Except for the Ar, the other four detrended curves are plotted over the raw series and show a decreasing growth trend, particularly after 60 years. Notice that the x-axis here is the opposite to that in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> (showing the curve increasing from the oldest to the youngest age, i.e. the abscissa represents the age of the tree while in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> it represents the year of birth) and should be chronologically read from right to left.
