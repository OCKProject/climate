   </sup>] (left-upper panel) was related to the mean annual growth of the sampled trees and shows a hyperbolic curve (right-upper panel). This can be split in two linear trends at the −4.3 °C threshold (dashed red line) derived from the evidence that before 1978 (dashed black line) temperature never exceeded this value (yellow area). Therefore the estimated temperatures for the missing years in the observations by [ref.
