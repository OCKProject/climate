  <p class="p">A graphical representation of the main vegetation detected in the field on a fine-scale sampling grid of 5 × 5 m. Numbers in the main transects (three vertical and four horizontal) represent tree IDs whose dimensions (height, d.b.h., crown width) and species have been recorded for all the trees with d.b.h. &gt;1 cm. The legend explains the vegetation and geomorphological representation on the grid with an altitudinal scale placed on the left side of the sampling grid. The background aerial-photo was taken with a drone. Labels at the elevation of the timberline, treeline and tree species line (definitions are in ref.
