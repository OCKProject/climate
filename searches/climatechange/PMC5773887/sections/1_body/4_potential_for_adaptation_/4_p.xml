  <italic class="italic">wider built infrastructure system</italic>
 </bold>, adaptation to increasing risks posed by flooding is a priority [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] as well as measures to ensure continued resilience to cold weather events. A ‘whole system’ approach taking into account interdependencies between different infrastructure systems, is required and local level network flow models can assist the development of cost effective adaptation strategies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">105</xref>]. The ARCC BIOPICCC project also pioneered the use of the NHS Strategic Health Asset Planning and Evaluation (SHAPE) toolkit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] as a way to identify parts of the infrastructure for which adaptation may be most needed and this toolkit now includes flood risk information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>]. More specific adaptation strategies include modifications to equipment, such as the use of winter tyres for ambulances during cold weather [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], installation of emergency generators at key health facilities to ensure continuity in power supplies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>], or strategic planning for future shortages of essential supplies [
