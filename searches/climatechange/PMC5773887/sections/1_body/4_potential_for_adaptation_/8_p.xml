 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>] and for medical education to cover climate change risks so that medical staff understand the issues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">116</xref>] and are better placed to act. Most disaster response mechanisms operated through normal, routine health care checks, rather than special procedures for extreme weather. Research is beginning to evaluate early warning systems that may enhance preparedness for extreme weather [
