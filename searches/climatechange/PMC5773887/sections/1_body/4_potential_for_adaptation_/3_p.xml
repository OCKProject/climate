 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] and solar shading options may help to reduce internal temperatures. A low-energy new-build hospital [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>] features: a building of 3–4 storeys, with courtyards facilitating ventilation strategy; air ducted through the building after being cooled naturally in a low level chamber; ‘thick’ walls; openings shaped and sized to reduce undesirable solar gain whilst preserving daylighting; single patient rooms naturally ventilated in ways other than opening windows. Options for low-energy refurbishment of existing, 1960s hospital buildings could halve their energy use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Advanced Natural Ventilation can be devised to move air through a building to achieve even greater energy efficiency [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>]. Similar options for 1970s courtyard hospital designs have also been presented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] and refurbishment of pre-1948 buildings should aim to further improve further the higher resilience of this type of structure, whilst enhancing patient privacy and dignity with design features such as individual patient rooms. These options can be executed in stages and are likely to achieve long term savings through greater energy efficiency. They might need to be applied variably across the country, given regional differences in climate, and the measures proposed could provide effective solutions up to the 2040s [
