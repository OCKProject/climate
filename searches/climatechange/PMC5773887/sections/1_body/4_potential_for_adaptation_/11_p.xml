International literature also emphasises stakeholder engagement and locally adapted frameworks to access critical social infrastructure involving connectedness, collaboration and adaptive response. While our review was not internationally comprehensive, we note examples of research in Canada [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141" class="xref">141</xref>]. Reviews also emphasise the need for a greater attention to 
 <bold class="bold">
  <italic class="italic">equity and inclusivity</italic>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" class="xref">142</xref>] and the increased care burdens that women are expected to undertake during disasters involving extreme weather events, that may be unsustainable [
