 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>] suggest protective behaviours to improve resilience to cold, such as clothing and central heating, are more common in colder regions. Changes in such behaviours over time in the UK may have contributed to reductions in cold weather mortality in London [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" class="xref">111</xref>] shows some individuals take what they consider effective health protective measures during extreme weather events. However, there is little research on whether such behaviour is widespread among those most at risk in the UK population, and it is recognised that public information campaigns may have limited effect [
