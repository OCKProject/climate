 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] show that the reported scale of current impacts observed internationally is quite variable. We did not identify any original research on health system impacts of floods using rigorously internationally comparative data and including the UK. We know little about the longer term health impacts of floods in the UK, which may affect patterns of service use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. International findings show significant but variable (8.6%–53%) increases in prevalence of psychiatric morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>], and other reviews conclude that post-traumatic impacts of flooding are significant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>]; so these may result in increased demand for health services.
