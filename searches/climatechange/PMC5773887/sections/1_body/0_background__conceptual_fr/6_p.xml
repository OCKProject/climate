<p id="Par7" class="p">We have framed this review to assess two sets of questions: first, what is the evidence concerning 
 <italic class="italic">observed</italic> impact of these events on service operability and access and on pressure of service demand on the care system; second, what is the evidence regarding potential 
 <italic class="italic">future</italic> impacts of extreme weather on health services in light of projected climate change (as projected up to 2050â€“80) and potential for adaptation of health and social care infrastructure in the context of climate change. This review focuses on evidence relevant to the UK, however we discuss in the concluding section how our approach and findings may also relate to health and social care systems internationally.
