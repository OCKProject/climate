  <title class="title">Objective</title>
  <p class="p">As the climate changes, it influences ruminant’s feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen methane production and emission. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding Sweet grass (
   <italic class="italic">Pennisetum purpureum</italic> cv. Mahasarakham; SG) as a new source of good quality forage to improve feed utilization efficiency and to mitigate rumen methane production and emission.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p class="p">Four, growing crossbred of Holstein Friesian heifers, 14 months old, were arranged in a 4×4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments. Treatment 1 (T1) was rice straw (RS) fed on 
   <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> with 1.0% body weight (BW) of concentrate (C) supplementation (RS/1.0C). Treatment 2 (T2) and treatment 3 (T3) were SG, fed on 
   <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> with 1.0% and 0.5% BW of concentrate supplementation, respectively (SG/1.0C and SG/0.5C, respectively). Treatment 4 (T4) was total Sweet grass fed on 
   <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> basis with non-concentrate supplementation (TSG).

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">The results revealed that roughage and total feed intake were increased with SG when compared to RS (p&lt;0.01) while TSG was like RS/1.0C treatment. Digestibility of nutrients, nutrients intake, total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), rumen microorganisms were the highest and CH4 was the lowest in the heifers that received SG/1.0C (p&lt;0.01). Total dry matter (DM) feed intake, digestibility and intake of nutrients, total VFAs, NH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N, bacterial and fungal population of animals receiving SG/0.5C were higher than those fed on RS/1.0C. Reducing of concentrate supplementation with SG as a roughage source increased NH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N, acetic acid, and fungal populations, but it decreased propionic acid and protozoal populations (p&lt;0.05). However, ruminal pH and blood urea nitrogen were not affected by the dietary treatments (p&gt;0.05).

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p">As the results, SG could be a good forage to improve rumen fermentation, decrease methane production and reduced the level of concentrate supplementation for growing ruminants in the tropics especially under global climate change.</p>
