<p class="p">Voluntary feed intake of roughages was different among dietary treatments (p&lt;0.01) while ratios of roughage intake were increased (55.8%, 64.1%, 81.0%, and 100.0% of DM, respectively) when reducing concentrate supplementation levels (
 <xref rid="t2-ajas-31-12-1890" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Concentrate supplementation at 0.5% BW with SG showed a greater feed intake, nutrient digestibility and nutrients intake compared to 1.0% BW concentrate fed with rice straw as the control group. Nutrients digestibility and intake of nutrients were higher with SG feeding when compared to rice straw feeding at the same concentrate supplementation at 1.0% of BW (p&lt;0.01). However, there were no significant differences among treatments in the ADF digestibility and ADF intake (p&gt;0.05). SG improved the nutrients intake and digestibility when compared to RS. Heifers that received the SG/1.0C diet had a greater total feed intake, digestibility, and nutrients intake while SG/0.5C and TSG were better but similar to RS/1.0C, respectively.
