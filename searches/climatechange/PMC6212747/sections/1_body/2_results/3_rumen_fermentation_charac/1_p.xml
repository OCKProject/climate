 <xref rid="t3-ajas-31-12-1890" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows that acetic acid, NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N concentration and fungi population were increased with decreasing concentrate supplementation (p&lt;0.05) while it decreased propionic acid and protozoal numbers (p&lt;0.05). Propionic acid, total VFAs, and bacterial population were the highest values with heifer receiving SG/1.0C diet (p&lt;0.05). The CH4 production was decreased with SG/1.0C as compared to RS/1.0C diet (p&lt;0.05). The TSG group has the highest value of acetic acid, NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N and fungal population while they have the lowest protozoal population (p&lt;0.05). Ruminal pH, butyric acid concentration and BUN levels were not affected by the experimental diets (p&gt;0.05).
