<p class="p">Previous researchers reported that using rich and locally available feed resources with good nutritive composition, such as cassava hay, corn, forage sorghum and tropical legumes, as the alternative forage could reduce concentrate supplementation with improved feed utilization in ruminants [

 <xref rid="b10-ajas-31-12-1890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] found that Sweet grass (
 <italic class="italic">Pennisetum purpureum</italic> cv. Mahasarakham; SG), a dwarf Napier grass variety, contains a high nutrient composition, especially in crude protein (15.2% dry matter [DM]), non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC, 12.1% DM) and is low in acid detergent fiber (ADF) content (34.9% DM). These characteristics are achieved when the plant is harvested at 42 days of growth when there is a high leaf to stem ratio leading to a high DM and organic matter degradability, and lower 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> gas production when compared with other tropical grasses namely Ruzi, Guinea, and Napier Pakchong1. At a higher ratio of roughage to concentrate (80:20), SG has similar in 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> degradability and gas production to the diet containing Guinea at a 60:40 ratio, in which Guinea grass was the lowest quality while SG was the highest quality forage. It appeared that SG can reduce concentrate supplementation. Nevertheless, more investigation on feed intake, rumen fermentation, and nutrient utilization are still required, especially on feed utilization with reduced concentrate supplementation. Therefore, the aim of this experiment was to determine the use of SG as a good quality forage to reduce the amount of concentrate supplementation in growing crossbred Holstein dairy in hot tropical conditions.
