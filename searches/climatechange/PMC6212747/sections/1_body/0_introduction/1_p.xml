<p class="p">As global warming occurs, it has been a topic of concern and significance for all, especially those engaged in ruminant production. Feed resources and feeding manipulation are of paramount importance to improve rumen fermentation efficiency and reduce methane production, which can affect global warming [

Among numerous sources, rice straw is an abundantly available feed resource in the sub-tropical and tropical area. Its low protein and high cellulose-lignin content can reduce nutrient digestibility, feed intake and production performances. In general, heifers are traditionally fed a high amount of roughage and a moderately low energy diet. However, low quality roughage feeding requires a high level of concentrate supplementation to compensate for the low nutrient intake which would result in decreased feed efficiency of the animal and increased production costs. Roughage has been considered a low cost source of nutrients and grain has been considered expensive, as a result, roughage use often was maximized to reduce feed cost. In addition, the other benefits of roughage included improved ruminal pH, overall rumen health, milk components, and economic return [

 <xref rid="b6-ajas-31-12-1890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. High quality roughage will allow the rumen microbes to increase the digestion of roughage itself, supplying more nutrients to the animal which could reduce the concentrate supplementation [

Furthermore, high quality forage diet feeding can increase the fiber physical effectiveness that could stimulate the cud chewing activity and decrease the risk of ruminal acidosis. Nevertheless, good or high quality roughage is required in order to reduce concentrate supplementation while maintaining the animal performances [
