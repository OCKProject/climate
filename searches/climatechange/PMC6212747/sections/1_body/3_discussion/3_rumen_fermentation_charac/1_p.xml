 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N tended to increase with the increasing of SG intake. It was found that the utilization of high protein forage needs carbohydrate (starch and sugar) to be synchronized for efficient microbial protein production with a decrease in NH

 <xref rid="b30-ajas-31-12-1890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In this experiment, it was found that reducing carbohydrate supply from concentrates resulted in increased NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N. The feeding of SG/0.5C showed similar response in these parameters with RS/1.0C. Using higher quality roughage provided more nutrients to rumen microbes for growth and resulted in increased microbial population and rumen fermentation end-products expressed in total VFAs and propionic acid concentration. Total VFA, propionic acid, bacterial and protozoal populations were highest in the heifers which received SG/1.0C as related with feed intake and digestibility as compared with RS/1.0C. Moreover, it could decrease CH4 emission that might be due to the nutrient composition of roughage influencing on methane yield, particularly hexose fermented and VFAs during the fermentation process in the rumen. Increasing of propionate with decreasing of acetate and butyrate by increasing of NFC in the diet resulted in decreased methane production. Forages that have a high content of NFC, generally support fermentation that increase production of propionate, which competes for hydrogen with methane production. Moreover, forages that have less NDF content could increase digestibility resulting in producing less methane [
