<p class="p">Four crossbred Holstein-Frisian heifers (mean±standard deviation) of body weight [BW]; 203±3.2 kg as initial weight); 14 months old were randomly assigned in a 4×4 Latin square design. Heifers received four dietary treatments with different roughage sources and concentrate supplementation levels. Rice straw (RS) and fresh SG were the roughage source and were fed on 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> basis. Levels of concentrate (C) supplementation were 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0% of BW. Four treatments are as follows: T1 was RS with 1.0% BW of C (RS/1.0C); T2 and T3 were SG with 1.0% and 0.5% BW of C, respectively (SG/1.0C and SG/0.5C, respectively). T4 was total SG fed on 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> (TSG). Experimental feed ingredients of the concentrate, nutrient composition of all experimental feeds are presented in
