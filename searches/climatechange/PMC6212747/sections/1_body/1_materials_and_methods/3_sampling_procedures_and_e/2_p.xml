<p class="p">Rumen fluid was taken at 0 and 4 hours after feeding on the last day of each period. Approximately, 200 mL of rumen fluid from each animal was collected by stomach tube connected to a vacuum pump. Rumen pH was measured immediately by a portable pH meter (HANNA instrument HI 8424 microcomputer, Singapore, Singapore) and then filtered through 4 layers of cheesecloth. Forty-five mL of rumen fluid was mixed with 5 mL of 1 M H
