<p class="p">First, the spatial distribution of NPP was consistent with that of precipitation and showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. The spatial distribution for which the NPP of the study area was 2008 g C/m

The upward trend of NPP in the study area from 2000 to 2015 may be closely related to the large-scale implementation of the Grain for Green Program and the Three Northern Shelter Forest Programs that have been run by the Chinese government since 1999. The rapid development of agricultural technology may also have played a role in the upward trend of NPP.
