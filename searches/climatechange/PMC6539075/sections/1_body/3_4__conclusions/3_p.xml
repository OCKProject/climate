<p class="p">Second, the second-order partial correlation coefficient of NPP and precipitation was between −0.96 and 0.95. The areas with positive and negative correlations accounted for 39.24% and 60.76% of the total study area, respectively. The area for which the partial correlation coefficient passed the significance test (

The partial correlation coefficient between NPP and LST was between −0.94 and 0.96, and the areas with positive and negative correlations accounted for 52.64% and 47.36% of the total area, respectively.

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (2.39% of the total study area). On the whole, NPP in the study area shows a negative correlation with precipitation and a positive correlation with temperature, which may be because the study area contains a large portion of the Tibetan Plateau, which predominately has year-round cold, wet conditions. The perennial low temperature condition in the Tibetan Plateau is the limiting factor for crop growth, and the occurrence of precipitation events will increase the cloud and soil moisture, thus aggravating the negative effects of low temperatures.
