<p class="p">In this study, when analyzing the effect of climate factors on NPP change, only the temperature, precipitation, and evaporation that have the most obvious effect on NPP were introduced. However, in fact, vegetation change is the result of combined effect of many climatic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, soil relative humidity, soil texture, solar radiation, and terrain. Therefore, when quantifying the effect of climate change on vegetation, the comprehensive effect of various factors on vegetation should be considered to more comprehensively and objectively quantify the internal driving mechanism of NPP change. The coupling relationship between vegetation and climate change is a complex system. The stability of different vegetation types and their adaptability to climate change differ from each other. Therefore, further research should focus on the effect of climate change on different types of land use. Human activities have both positive and negative effects on NPP changes. The residual analysis method should be used to evaluate the positive and negative effects of human activities on NPP change and analyze the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to NPP.</p>
