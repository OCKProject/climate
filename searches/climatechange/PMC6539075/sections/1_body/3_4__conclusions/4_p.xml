<p class="p">Finally, the persistence of NPP showed significant differences on different time and seasonal scales. The biggest persistence of NPP was observed for autumn (185.52 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> or 49.92% of the study area), followed by spring and summer, accounting for 25.67% and 13.40% of the total area, respectively. The lowest persistence of NPP was in winter, in which only 25.09 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (6.75%) of the study area showed persistence of NPP. On an annual scale, the region with a Hurst index of &gt;0.5 accounted for 46% of the total study area and was distributed in the eastern part of the study area. The NPP shows obvious anti-persistence characteristics on the annual scale, indicating that although NPP in the research area has increased over the past 20 years, NPP is likely to be degraded in the future due to the strong ecological vulnerability and the complex, changing climatic conditions.
