 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], and predictions of future trends [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] studied the spatial–temporal variations and factors that affect the NPP of vegetation and concluded that NPP is significantly affected by rainfall and the increase in urbanization. Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that during the 1980s and 1990s, the decrease in precipitation decreased the NPP in the transition zone between agriculture and livestock farming in China. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] found a significant correlation between NPP and evapotranspiration by studying the degree to which the drought in southwestern China affected NPP processes. Previous studies have used simple correlation analysis to study the impact of climate change on NPP, and such studies have confirmed that NPP is simultaneously affected by a variety of climate factors and human activities [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. As a result, it is difficult to adequately quantify the impact of a single climate factor on NPP. Vast amounts of literature focusing on the impact of climate change on NPP were reviewed as part of this study, and three critical research gaps were revealed. First, previous studies have considered annual precipitation data from 824 meteorological stations in mainland China. In contrast, this study incorporates the analysis and spatial interpolation of data from over 2400 meteorological stations. Second, most previous studies that aimed to predict the persistence of NPP have been undertaken on an annual scale and rarely examined the more detailed seasonal scale. Furthermore, limited methodologies have been used in these studies for determining the current patterns, variation trends, influence of climate change, and the persistence of NPP into the future in the 400 mm Annual Precipitation Fluctuation Zone. The influence of climate factors on vegetation NPP has been previously analyzed by a simple correlation analysis method without excluding other variables closely related to the target, and such omissions lead to errors. In addition, many recent studies have been reported on contemporary real-life case studies of machine learning techniques in hydrologic prediction. Moazenzadeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] attempted to solve the problem that most meteorological stations in developing countries do not record evaporation. A new hybrid algorithm was used to predict evaporation, and the performance of support vector regression (SVR) and SVR model coupled with firefly algorithm (SVR-FA) model in predicting the daily evaporation of Lahijan and Rasht stations in northern Iran was evaluated. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] presented a three-person multi-objective conflict decision model for reservoir flood control. This model is simple and easy to operate and can be applied to practical problems. It has been verified in the practical application of Fengman reservoir in China. Yaseen et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] verified the feasibility of enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow prediction in tropical environments. In the context of climate change, the increased frequency of extreme flooding poses a severe threat to economy and human security. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately predict the time and magnitude of peak discharge before the arrival of flood. Chau [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] proposed that meta-heuristic techniques can be used to calibrate data-driven rainfall and runoff models to improve the prediction accuracy. In view of the lagged prediction effect that often occurs during neural network modeling, Wu and Chaw [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] attempted to eliminate the lag effect from modular artificial neural network (MANN) and data preprocessing by singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Ghorbani et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] adopted the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model and the independent of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to evaluate the prediction precision of MLP based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MLP- QPSO) model. The results show that the hybrid MLP-QPSO model is an optimal prediction tool for estimating daily evaporation, better than the hybrid MLP-PSO model and standalone model. The 400 mm annual precipitation line serves as a natural divide between China’s semi-humid and semi-arid regions, marking a biome separator between forest and grassland vegetation, as well as China’s regions for crop and livestock agriculture. In this study, in order to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of NPP in response to climate change within the fluctuation zone along the 400 mm annual precipitation line, dispersion degree of the annual mean NPP and the variation in the trends of NPP was analyzed by using the coefficient of variation and the unitary linear regression method. The significance of the variation in trends was verified. Previous studies have found that the main driving factors of NPP are temperature and precipitation [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In this study, the second-order partial correlation analysis method was used to analyze the partial correlation between NPP and precipitation by limiting the influence of evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST). This can effectively avoid the interference of other variables on the analysis results and increase the degree of fitting between the analysis results and actual situation. Furthermore, the effects of ET and precipitation were limited, and the partial correlation between LST and NPP was analyzed. Finally, the Hurst index estimation method was used to predict future trends of NPP in the study area at both annual and seasonal scales. This study reveals the driving forces and limitations of climate factors’ effects on NPP in China’s ecologically sensitive areas and provides a scientific basis for formulating regional environmental governance and protection.
