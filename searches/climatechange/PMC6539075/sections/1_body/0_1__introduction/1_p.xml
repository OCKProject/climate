<p class="p">Net primary production (NPP) refers to the total amount of organic matter accumulated by vegetation per unit time and area. It is the difference between gross primary productivity (GPP) and autotrophic respiration (AR) produced through plant photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. As an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem, vegetation can effectively connect and exchange energy between the atmosphere, water, and soil [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. NPP results from the interaction between plants, and the environment represents the productivity of plants and the response of the ecosystem to climate change. Simultaneously, food and fuel for human survival and development come from NPP, an essential indicator of the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great significance to effectively evaluate the current situation and predict future trends of NPP. This study is valuable for understanding the impact of climate change on the environment and the response mechanisms of vegetation to climate change.
