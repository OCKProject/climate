<p class="p">NPP data with the temporal resolution of monthly from 2000 to 2015 were extracted from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17A3 dataset and based on the Biome Bio Geochemical Cycles Model (BIOME-BGC), the improved Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA), and the corrected influence of clouds and aerosols from MODIS LAI-FPAR [

To meet the needs of this study, we used the statistical analysis tool in ArcGIS software (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, USA) to convert the temporal resolution of NPP data from monthly to seasons and annual. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset with the temporal resolution of annual were provided by the International Scientific &amp; Technical Data Mirror Site, Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (

The MODIS MOD16A2/ET data with the temporal resolution of annual were provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Numerical Terra Dynamic Simulation Group (

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] used the MODIS daily average meteorological reanalysis data and 8-day remote sensing vegetation attributes as inputs to improve the ET algorithm. Their improved algorithm was then used to calculate the net radiation of vegetation and soil by comprehensively considering information such as vegetation coverage, albedo, air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. Lastly, the Penman–Monteith model [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] was used to calculate the grayscale remote sensing image dataset of global land surface evapotranspiration. The meteorological monitoring data of all meteorological stations in China from 1951 to 2015 were obtained from the Meteorological Data Sharing Network (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.nmic.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.nmic.cn/</uri>). From 1951 to 2015, the temporal resolution of the meteorological stations’ precipitation data is monthly. We obtain yearly precipitation data from the accumulated value of the monthly precipitation in each year. Land use data from 2000 to 2015 were obtained from the Resource and Environmental Data Cloud Platform (
