<p class="p">The ecotone between agriculture and animal husbandry is bound by a 400 mm precipitation line, but the precipitation is largely random and sudden, resulting in annual differences in the location of the 400 mm precipitation line. Therefore, on the basis of the precipitation data collected since 1951 by 2474 meteorological stations in Mainland China, this study identified the 400 mm annual precipitation line in each year of the study period and took the fluctuation area of the 400 mm annual precipitation line in each year as the study area. Professional meteorological data interpolation software, ANUSPLIN, was used to interpolate the annual precipitation data from weather stations from 1951 to 2015. The interpolated raster of annual precipitation data was used to derive the annual 400 mm precipitation lines for each year. The research area was obtained from the fluctuation range of the 400 mm precipitation line (

These provinces span the eastern monsoon, northwest arid, and semi-arid regions and the Tibetan Plateau. The unique geographical location and poor climate conditions of the study area lead to an ecologically sensitive environment that is extremely vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic activities. The occurrence of frequent droughts, the erosion of soils, desertification, and the loss of biodiversity have been more severe in recent years [
