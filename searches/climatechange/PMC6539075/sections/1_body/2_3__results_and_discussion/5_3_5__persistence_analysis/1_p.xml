<p class="p">This study was based on the use of annual and seasonal NPP raster data from 2000 to 2015. The Hurst index estimation method was used to interpolate the future trends of NPP. The persistent changes in NPP showed significant differences on different time scales for future predictions (

NPP showed continued persistence into the future and was mainly distributed in two regions: (1) Henan and Shandong and (2) the border between Inner Mongolia and Liaoning. In autumn, NPP persisted over an area of 185.52 × 10

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (49.92%) and was mainly distributed in Qinghai, southeastern Tibet, eastern Gansu, western Ningxia and Shaanxi, and most of northeastern Inner Mongolia. The NPP persisted over an area of 25.09 × 10

Additionally, there were a few areas in the southeastern corner of Tibet in which the NPP was more persistent. On an annual scale, the Hurst index estimate was between 0.11 and 1, with a mean of 0.497 and a standard deviation of 0.10. Fifty-four percent (159.54 × 10

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the study area had a Hurst index of &lt;0.5, indicating that the NPP will persist into the future. The regions with a Hurst index of &gt;0.5 were mainly distributed in the eastern provinces that have good hydrothermal conditions; these regions include Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, the border of Liaoning and Hebei, and the border of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei. The NPP in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia and the northern part of Shaanxi showed significant persistence, consistent with the findings of Tong et al. [

The strong persistence of NPP around Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei indicates that the vegetation in these areas continuously improved [
