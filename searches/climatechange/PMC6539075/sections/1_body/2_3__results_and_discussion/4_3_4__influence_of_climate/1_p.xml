 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This study focused on analyzing the influence of climate factors on NPP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01497-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>aâ€“d). To exclude the interference of other variables on NPP, this study adopted the second-order partial correlation analysis method to analyze the correlation between NPP and precipitation and LST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01497-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a,c). Firstly, the ET and LST were used as control variables to analyze the partial correlation between NPP and the target variable (precipitation). Secondly, precipitation and EP were used as control variables to analyze the partial correlation between NPP and target variable (LST).
