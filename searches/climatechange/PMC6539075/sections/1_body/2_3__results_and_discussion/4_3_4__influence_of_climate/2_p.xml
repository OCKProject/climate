<p class="p">The partial correlation coefficient between NPP and precipitation was between −0.96 and 0.95, and the positive and negative correlation areas accounted for 39.24% and 60.76% of the study area, respectively (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01497-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that there was a negative correlation between NPP and precipitation in the study area. The regions with a positive correlation between NPP and precipitation were concentrated in eastern and western Inner Mongolia, western Jilin, and Liaoning, as well as most of Hebei and central Qinghai, which have experienced severe water shortage and are distant from the ocean. The abovementioned areas are severely affected by drought due to the lack of precipitation and high rate of evaporation. Relevant studies show that the trend of warming and drying in the inland areas of northwest China, especially the Loess Plateau, is strengthening [

An upward trend of temperature promoted an increase in soil moisture evaporation, further aggravating water shortage in these regions. Therefore, water resources are the main limiting factor for vegetation growth. This is why NPP and precipitation have a positive correlation in arid and semiarid regions. This positive correlation between NPP and precipitation in the arid and rainless steppe region of Inner Mongolia is consistent with the conclusion obtained by Pan et al. [

The negative correlation was concentrated on the border between Qinghai and Tibet, the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, and the border between Inner Mongolia and Liaoning. Water resources in the above areas, particularly the southeastern edge of Tibetan Plateau, are relatively abundant. Precipitation decreases at higher altitude. This, in turn, reduces regional temperatures and limits the NPP. The partial correlation coefficient of NPP and precipitation passed the significance test (

Regions with a negative correlation accounted for 2.28% of the total area, mainly distributed at the Qinghai and Tibet border. This is consistent with the conclusion that the NPP was negatively correlated with temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation in relevant studies [
