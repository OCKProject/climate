<p class="p">In this study, the spatial heterogeneity characteristics of NPP were analyzed from global and local scale perspectives. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01497-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> is the scatter diagram of the mean and maximum NPP values in each county-level administrative unit. The Moranâ€™s I index of the mean NPP value and maximum NPP value was 0.71 and 0.59, and the Z values were 40.55 and 35.53, respectively, both of which passed the 1% confidence test. These results show that the global correlation of the mean NPP value was greater than the maximum NPP value. Most county-level administrative units are located in the first and third quadrants of the diagram, and the NPP in the study area had a significant positive correlation on the global scale, with strong spatial clustering and heterogeneity.
