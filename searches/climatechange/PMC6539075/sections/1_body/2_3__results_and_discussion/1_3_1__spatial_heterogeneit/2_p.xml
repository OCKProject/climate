<p class="p">The local autocorrelation results of the mean NPP value show (

There were 10 county-level administrative units with the HL type and 22 with the LH type, accounting for 0.72% and 1.59% of the total, respectively. The number of counties with non-significant results accounted for 51.88% of the total. Combined with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01497-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, the HH type was mainly distributed in the southeast and eastern marginal areas of the study area. The LL type was mainly distributed in the northwest and west of the study area. The regions that passed the 0.1% significance test were clustered in the northwest of the study area, while regions that passed the 1% significance test were clustered in the southeast of the study area (

The local autocorrelation analysis results of the maximum NPP value show that the number of HH types and LL types accounted for 16.55% of the total number in the study area. There were 18 HL types and 21 LH types with abnormal spatial distribution, accounting for 1.30% and 1.52% of the total, respectively. The number of counties with a non-significant result accounted for 68.79% of the total. Combined with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01497-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b, the HH type was mainly distributed in the southwest, southeast, and northeast of the study area, while the LL type was mainly distributed in the northwest. The regions that passed the 0.1% significance test were clustered in the northwest and northeast of the study area, while the regions that passed the 1% significance test were clustered in the north-central and northern parts of the study area (
