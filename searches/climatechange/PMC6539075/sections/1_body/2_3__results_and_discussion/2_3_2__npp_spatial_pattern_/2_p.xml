 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01497-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the statistical results of land use transfers that occurred from 2000 to 2015. According to the retention rate of land use types, from 2000 to 2015, the study area was dominated by grassland (179.35 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and farmland (66.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), accounting for 48.29% and 17.77% of the total study area, respectively. Forest was the third most dominant land use type (46.26 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and accounted for 12.46% of the study area. The desert areas were the smallest (6.94 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The area of farmland converted into desert was the largest of the land use transfer areas, reaching 8956 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The area of grassland that was converted into desert was 2648 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This indicates that the study area is ecologically sensitive and at risk of further deterioration. The area converted from grassland to farmland was 4994 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and from farmland to grassland was 4346 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. There was a dramatic mutual transformation process between the two land types, indicating that land use in the study area has been significantly affected by human activities. In addition, 2856 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of built-up area was transferred to grassland. This may be closely related to the Chinese government’s strict control of 120 million hectares of arable land in recent years and its resolute clampdown on the illegal occupation of arable land. The area of grassland that was converted into built-up area was 3418 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, reflecting the blind pursuit of rapid expansion through urbanization in recent years, even at the cost of the environment.
