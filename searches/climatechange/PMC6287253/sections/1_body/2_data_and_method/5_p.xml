<p class="p">For the identification of claims, we used the codebook developed by 
 <xref rid="bibr25-0267323118790155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koopmans (2002)</xref>. For identification of evaluations, we trained our coders and developed our own codebook through coding a sample of 71 articles reporting on the COP 14, that is, material not included in the sample analysed here.

 </sup> We held five meetings, for which each of the six coders coded a set of 10â€“15 articles. Results were compared, and difficult coding decisions that were identified contributed to updating the rules written in our codebook. Thus, an updated version of the codebook was used for each new set of articles discussed in the consequent meeting. In the fifth meeting, we recorded the results from each coder and calculated intercoder reliability coefficients following the model used by 
 <xref rid="bibr27-0267323118790155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koopmans and Statham (2010</xref>: 53). Reliability easily satisfied conventional standards. The reliability coefficient for claim identification was 0.92 and for coding the evaluation category 0.95.
