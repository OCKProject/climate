<p class="p">Our sample includes material from five countries: the United States, Finland, France, Russia and India. We began by selecting one leading quality newspaper from each country (
 <xref rid="table1-0267323118790155" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These are 
 <italic class="italic">The New York Times</italic> (United States), 
 <italic class="italic">Le Monde</italic> (France), 
 <italic class="italic">Helsingin Sanomat</italic> (Finland), 
 <italic class="italic">The Hindu</italic> (India) and 
 <italic class="italic">Kommersant</italic> (Russia). Due to the labour-intensive nature of manual coding, we were faced with the choice of either selecting two newspapers from each country or including as many countries as coder resources allowed. We chose the latter, because we are interested in global trends, not in differences between countries. The two exceptions to this rule were India and Russia. Because data from 
 <italic class="italic">The Hindu</italic> was not available electronically for 1997, we used data from the countryâ€™s other two major newspapers in English, 
 <italic class="italic">The Times of India</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">The Economic Times</italic> for that year. After discovering that the level of coverage in Russia was so low that no meaningful results could have been produced by using just one newspaper, we added two others, 
 <italic class="italic">Izvestya</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Trud</italic>.
