<p class="p">For each claim, we coded the type of the organization presenting the claim (see categories in 
 <xref rid="table3-0267323118790155" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) and the type of evaluation (ecological, economic, eco-modern and other). Within the category of economic evaluations, thus, we separated between those that resisted climate change mitigation on economic grounds (‘economy over ecology’) and those that saw climate change mitigation and economic growth as mutually supportive, rather than competing goals (‘eco-modern’ evaluations).

 </sup> The evaluative component of the claim usually answers the question why something should or should not be done to curb climate change. 
 <xref rid="table2-0267323118790155" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> presents an example of each of the three main types of evaluations analysed in this article.
