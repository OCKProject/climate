<p class="p">Our work adds to the existing research on media coverage of climate change in several ways. 
 <italic class="italic">First</italic>, most studies have been single-country cases or two-country comparisons (

 <xref rid="bibr52-0267323118790155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wagner and Payne, 2015</xref>), or in the cases where several countries are compared, the focus is most often on simple indicators such as the volume of coverage or studies only cover a short time period (e.g.

We are interested in a more in-depth analysis of global trends, so our sample includes material in four languages from five countries. The countries are the United States, Finland, France, Russia and India, ranging from major players to minor ones, developed to developing countries and covering much political, geographical and journalistic diversity. 
 <italic class="italic">Second</italic>, we are interested in changes over time, so our sample covers a period starting from the early days of global climate change politics, the Kyoto COP in 1997, and ends in 2013. Not many earlier studies on media coverage of climate change have been both broadly comparative and longitudinal (
