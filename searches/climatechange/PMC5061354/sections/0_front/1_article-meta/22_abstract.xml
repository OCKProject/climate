 <p class="p">Climate change is recognized as an important threat to global biodiversity because it increases the risk of extinction of many species on the planet. Mexico is a megadiverse country and native tree species such as red cedar (
  <italic class="italic">Cedrela odorata</italic>) can be used to maintain forests while helping mitigate climate change, because it is considered a fast growing pioneer species with great economic potential in the forestry industry. In order to assess possible shifts in areas suitable for 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations in Mexico with ecological niche models, we used the MaxLike algorithm, climate variables, the geo-referenced records of this species, three general circulation models and three scenarios of future emissions. Results show a current potential distribution of 573,079 km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> with an average probability of occurrence of 0.93 (± 0.13). The potential distribution area could increase up to 650,356 km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> by 2060 according to the general circulation model HADCM3 B2, with an average probability of occurrence of 0.86 (± 0.14). Finally, we delimited an area of 35,377 km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> that has a high potential for the establishment of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations, by selecting those sites with optimal conditions for its growth that are outside protected areas and are currently devoid of trees. 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> has a significant potential to help in the mitigation of the effects of climate change. Using MaxLike we identified extense areas in Mexico suitable to increase carbon sequestration through plantations of this highly valued native tree species.
