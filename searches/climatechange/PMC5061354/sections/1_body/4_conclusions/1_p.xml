<p class="p">Our modeling efforts suggest that it is very likely that by 2060 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> will still find suitable climate conditions in Mexico, and this may allow for its increased presence in the landscape. This increase is very likely to imply not only a larger spatial distribution but also its presence at higher elevations in mountain ranges. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> is a tree species of ecological, economic, and social relevance, and therefore it is a valuable target to include in strategies to mitigate climate change at the regional and national levels. The use of the MaxLike algorithm in species distribution modeling was an excellent choice for the analysis of the response of this species to climate change scenarios in our study, but it may still need to be evaluated under a variety of conditions, as this has been necessary for other algorithms.
