 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic>’s current distribution when using the HADCM3 general circulation model for A2 and B2 climate scenarios, respectively. The HADCM3 future model projects large increases in average temperature but only a slight reduction in precipitation, so under these future conditions

 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> should find better conditions. However, the average value for the future probability of occurrence is lower in all of our models. Most of them, however, suggest an increase in elevation is likely [
