<p class="p">Over an eight year period,

 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Thus, we estimate that in the 35,377 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> where we found have optimum conditions for its establishment, it could store approximately 15,743,094 tons of carbon over the same time span. Regarding mitigation activities, Xu and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] found that the activity with the least investment required per ton of C is forest regeneration, followed by a long-rotation plantation cycle and forest protection. Given this, we suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations would increase carbon capture with a potentially competitive investment cost per ton of carbon captured.
