 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> with MaxLike suggests that this species has significant potential to help mitigate the effects of climate change. Its adaptability, fast growth, valuable wood, and initially branchless habit suggest it is well suited for timber plantation [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It is a heliophytic tree that is regarded as a persistent pioneer due to its relatively long life span. Its establishment and growth are favored in medium to large canopy gaps after natural disturbances, and in agricultural landscapes it can also thrive if proper agroforestry practices are followed. Since pre-Hispanic times its wood has been prized and in traditional shifting cultivation farmers usually spare
