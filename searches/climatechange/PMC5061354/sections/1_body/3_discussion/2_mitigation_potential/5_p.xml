<p class="p">The behavior of the MaxLike algorithm has been tested by Fitzpatrick and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. They found, at least for ants in New England, a more sensible prediction of species distribution when using MaxLike in comparison with other algorithms. In our case, when we overlapped 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantation locations with our expected distribution maps the match was greater than 95%. We interpret this result to mean that MaxLike succeeded very well at matching the knowledge of the people in the region regarding the distribution patterns of this species.
