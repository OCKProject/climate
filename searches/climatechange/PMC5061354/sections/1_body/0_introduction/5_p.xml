 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> was listed in the Official Mexican Standard NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 in the category “Subject to special protection” (Pr), which has caused some decrease in the establishment of red cedar plantations supported by the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR, the institution responsible for forestry in Mexico). Since it is now subject to special protection, trade in wood from plantations or even timber from a few trees (often grown by farmers on their land), has become complicated, discouraging the management and utilization of the species.
