<p class="p">Increased tree mortality and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over the 21st century, due to increased temperatures and drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Forests have two important roles with respect to global warming: the retention of carbon in the standing forest and the regulation of carbon flow by absorption through photosynthesis and through emission from clearing, the latter of which can be reduced by avoiding deforestation and counteracted by restoring woodlands [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Carbon is stored in the leaves, branches, trunks, and roots of trees as well as in forest soils. Old-growth tropical forests store 120 to 400 tonnes/ha of carbon [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Even without the loss of forest cover it is estimated that the increase in soil temperature from global warming has the potential to release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, forming an additional positive feedback for climate change [
