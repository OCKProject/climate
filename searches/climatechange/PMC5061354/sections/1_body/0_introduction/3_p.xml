<p class="p">Human intervention in forests to reduce the sources (emission) or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases is an interesting approach to mitigation that we have to balance with the current acceleration in biodiversity loss, which in turn threatens the provisioning of many ecosystem services to humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Several forest-related options are available for climate change mitigation: maintaining or increasing forest area, reducing deforestation, increasing afforestation (mainly by establishing plantations) and reforestation, increasing the use of wood products from sustainably managed forests and increasing long-term carbon storage in timber products [

 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry seems to be afforestation, sustainable forest management, and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Reforestation and afforestation can be very effective at sequestering carbon and can make great contributions to rural livelihoods and biodiversity conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Ideally, plantations should provide environmental and socio-economic benefits so as to reduce pressure on natural forests, offset fossil fuel consumption, help to meet biomass demand, and provide rural employment [
