<p class="p">There is substantial consensus recognizing that the climate on Earth is changing and that human activities are the main cause of the increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is the main factor driving the change [

There are reliable estimates that from 1880 to 2012, the air temperature close to the surface of Earth’s landmasses and that of the oceans increased by about 0.85°C. It is estimated to be likely that by 2100 the temperature will increase by 2.6 to 4.8°C [

Precipitation contrasts between wet and dry areas and between seasons will increase, which in turn will have a great and varied influence on forest structure and dynamics around the world [

A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species will face increased extinction risk under projected scenarios of climate change during and beyond the 21st century, particularly as climate change interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution, and the arrival of invasive species [
