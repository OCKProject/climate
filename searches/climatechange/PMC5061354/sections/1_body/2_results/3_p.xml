 <italic class="italic">Cedrela</italic> was located at 18°49'30'' N latitude and 95°27'50.40'' W longitude, 12 km from the coast in the Gulf of Mexico. The direction of the vectors obtained with the SDMTools contrasted for each of the GCM selected in this study. The vectors of the CGCM3 model pointed to the southwest, while those of HADCM3 pointed to the northwest. The GFDLCM21 vectors differed among years: that for 2030 pointing to the west while that of 2060 shifted towards the southwest. Regarding vector magnitude, the largest intensity of change occurred in the vectors related to the A2 and B2 scenarios projected to 2060 under HADCM3 (
