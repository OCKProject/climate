<p class="p">All of the scenarios of future climate change that we tried suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> will expand across Mexico, with the exception of CGCM3 B1 by 2030. Under the latter scenario, the expected area decreased by 3.8% in relation to the estimated current distribution. The models with the largest projected area were HADCM3 A2 and HADCM3 B2 by 2060 with an increase of 12.3% and 13.5%, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164178.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The average probability of occurrence for each of the scenarios decreased over time. The smallest probability, 0.77 (± 0.15), was associated with HADCM3 A2 by 2060. Most models showed a future increase in the average elevation of 
 <italic class="italic">Cedrela</italic>’s occurrence in relation to the projected current elevation, the only exceptions were CGCM3 B1 and HADCM3 B2, both projected a decrease in elevation by 2030. We also found that we could expect a further increase by 2060 in the average elevation our models projected for 2030, except in the case of GFDLCM21 A2.
