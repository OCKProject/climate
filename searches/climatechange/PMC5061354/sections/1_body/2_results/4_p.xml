 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> grows in different vegetation types, so when we superimposed our current distribution map of 
 <italic class="italic">Cedrela</italic> over INEGI’s Series V (2013) land use and vegetation cover map [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], we found some polygons with woody vegetation, some with secondary vegetation and others with no apparent vegetation. 
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows only the sites where woodland or forest cover is not dominant, which we regarded as suitable for the establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations. The INEGI Series V [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] categories: “selva alta” and “selva mediana” for the evergreen (“perennifolia”) and semi-evergreen (“sub-perennifolia”) vegetation types were all regarded here as tropical evergreen forest.
