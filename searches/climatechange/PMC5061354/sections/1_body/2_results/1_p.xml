<p class="p">To produce the best fitting niche model possible we conducted cross validations to assess the quality of the models. We used 65% of the sample of 
 <italic class="italic">Cedrela</italic>â€™s true locations for training and the remaining 35% for testing (i.e. validation). The lowest omission error of the best 10 models for current climate conditions was 2.32, the largest was 9.3, and the average was 5.11. The ROC partial evaluation returned a value of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt;0.002. The current conditions model produced a minimum value of 0.51 for the PO of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic>. Therefore, we regarded this value as indicative of the "likely presence" of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> both in the current map and those projected for future conditions. This way, we estimated the potential distribution area of the species, which was 573,079 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> under current conditions, and ranged from 551,053 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 650,356 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for the different scenarios of future climate change (
