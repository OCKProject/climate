<p class="p">To select the climate variables for modeling we did a preliminary calibration with 200 iterations of the MaxLike algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], using the eleven variables available in the Moscow FSL dataset (see above) to describe current conditions and using the coordinates of verified records for

The calibration results showed that the most important variables were: degree-days&gt; 5°C (hereafter: DD5), mean minimum temperature in the coldest month (MMIN), degree-days &lt;0°C (MINDD0) and mean temperature in the warmest month (MTWM).
