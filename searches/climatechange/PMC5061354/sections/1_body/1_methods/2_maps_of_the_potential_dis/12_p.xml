<p class="p">We superimposed the presence consensus maps for current and future conditions over official cartography of land use and vegetation cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] to identify those areas without any forests or tree cover that we regarded as prime candidates for reforestation or suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations. Finally, we explored suitability for plantations by converting potential current areas into polygons, from which we subtracted the polygons located within protected areas under federal jurisdiction [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], as well as plots with slopes too steep for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> and those that were too far from roads (which would make plantation maintenance and exploitation too costly). Thus, we chose polygons with a PO greater than 0.85, slopes less than 10Â° and that were no further than 10 km from any main road. To validate our potential distribution model with external data and to explore the potential impact of climate change with current policies, the model was contrasted with the polygons of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> plantations officially registered from 2000 to 2014, based on information provided by CONAFOR. These plantations were established by the owners without any technical advice from CONAFOR. They chose plots to introduce red cedar based on the knowledge they had acquired about the habits of the species from experience.
