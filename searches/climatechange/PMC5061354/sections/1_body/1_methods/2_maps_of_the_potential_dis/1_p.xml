 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In an attempt to address this limitation, Royle and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] introduced MaxLike, a formal likelihood model that explicitly estimates the probability of species occurrence and species’ prevalence, given presence-only data and a set of environmental covariates measured at each sampling location. They showed that MaxLike is capable of accurately estimating the absolute probability of occurrence (PO), i.e. the probability that a given species is present in a grid cell, whereas MaxEnt cannot [
