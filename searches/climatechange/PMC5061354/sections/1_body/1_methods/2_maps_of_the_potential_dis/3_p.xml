<p class="p">We used the three General Circulation Models (GCM) that are currently available for Mexico and three different scenarios of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. We used the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CGCM3) version of scenarios A2 and B1. From the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDLCM21), we used their version of the A2 scenario. Finally, from the Hadley Center (HADCM3) we used their version of scenarios B2 and A2. We explored projections for the years 2030 and 2060 for each of the indicated scenarios. All scenarios used, predict a future increase in average temperature, with HADCM3 A2 2060 showing the largest difference in comparison to current values, with an increase of 2.9Â°C. All models predicted a future reduction in precipitation. The scenarios of the HADCM3 model had the lowest decreases in precipitation, while those of CGCM3 had the largest, with almost two times less precipitation than the previous model. The scenario with the lowest future emission of CO
