<p class="p">A technique for evaluating models based solely on appearances by an array of modified confusion matrix are ROC curves (Receiver Operating Characteristic) [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This technique, which originated in radar signal processing, has been successfully applied in evaluating distribution models based on presence-absence algorithms [

 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], as well as presence-only data [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, due to some problems with ROC analyses [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] we used partial-area ROC [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] to evaluate the current model by randomly selecting 35% of the records used in model generation and the current presence model. Partial-ROC is a modification of the original ROC curve that has been proposed to overcome two of the problems detected in the latter to evaluate SDMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], namely the inclusion in the calculation of the AUC of the full spectrum of proportional areas in the study area and an equal weighting of the omission and commission error components (see [
