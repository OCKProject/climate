<p class="p">Finally, to analyze the direction and magnitude of change between the maps of current and future potential distributions, we calculated and compared the centroids and vectors of current and future suitable areas using a python-based GIS toolkit, SDMtoolbox [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This analysis is used to summarize the core distributional shifts in the range of many species. It associates each species distribution pattern with a centroid (expected multivariate location under the model fitted) and creates a vector file depicting the magnitude and direction of the predicted change over time as a function of scenario values.
