<p class="p">We arranged the models that satisfied the selection criteria according to their relative occurrence area (ROA) values; which is the ratio between the area of occurrence and the whole study area [
 <xref rid="pone.0164178.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Then we chose 10 models around the statistical median that had an average probability of presence obtained with validated records nearest to 1 since theoretically the average of this value should be 1. Then we produced a consensus map by averaging these 10 maps (the same models set for current and future conditions). Finally, we regarded an indication of the likely presence of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">odorata</italic> to be the minimum probability value that generated a distribution map that included all of the actual presence records of the species in our data set.
