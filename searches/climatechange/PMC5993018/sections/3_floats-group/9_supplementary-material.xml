   <italic class="italic">Emys trinacris</italic> within their technical sheets (Status = NO) (even though the species is found within their respective borders) or defining a “Data Deficient” status (DD). Sites of Community Importance (Habitats Directive) are reported as “SCI” and Special Protection Area (Birds Directive) are reported as “SPA” in Protected Areas’ designation type (Design). The field “Site name” reports the original PAs’ names; the “Status_yr” reports the year of PAs’ first proposal as SCI or SPA; “Web source” reports the link to the national official repository (the ftp web link to the Italian Ministry of the Environment) for the technical sheets corresponding to each site.
