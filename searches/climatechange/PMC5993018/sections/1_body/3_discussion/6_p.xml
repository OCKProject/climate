<p class="p">Finally, results from the gap analysis performed considering the predicted suitability within the different future scenarios also show a low effectiveness of existing PAs in protecting the target species with respect to changing climate conditions. Indeed, from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> it emerges that the peak of extent in territories protected by PAs falls in the low-to-medium predicted suitability range (0.2â€“0.5) under all the RCP scenarios, thus demonstrating the ongoing and forthcoming problems for the conservation of this endemic species.
