<p class="p">The gap analysis performed on the predicted habitat suitability under current climate corroborates the lack of adequate protection for 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic> which already emerged from the assessment of the current protection status on the presence records: about a half of PAs covers highly suitable areas, while the other half covers area with poor predicted suitability. Furthermore, consulting the PAs’ technical sheets it emerged that 3 out of the 18 PAs in which the target species has been recorded do not even indicate in their plans 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic> as present within their borders. Overall, 17 management plans report the status of “Data Deficient” for 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ local populations. The relevant data concerning the mentioned PAs are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" class="xref">Supplement 5</xref>, with the respective source web link provided.
