<p class="p">The localities where 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic> is currently recorded are spread throughout the study area. Accordingly, the EM built on the current climatic conditions resulted in areas with high habitat suitability predicted to cover different parts of the island, not limited to the neighbourhoods of the presence sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). An apparent distinction is observable between suitable and non-suitable areas, with these latter mostly located in the eastern and southern portions of the study area, as well as across the main mountainous chains. This latter result agrees with the altitudinal limits of the target species, which is found from 0 to 1,007 m a.s.l. (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marrone et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the fact that a relatively wide area predicted to be highly suitable in the central and northern part of the island do not host recorded presence localities suggests that the potential distribution of the species might be wider than the current status of knowledge. Also, 
 <xref rid="ref-85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Turrisi (2008)</xref> reports the use of different aquatic environments in the northern (forest and artificial aquatic habitats) and western populations (coastal wetlands), while the central, eastern and southern populations live in mountain lakes and ponds, slow-moving river bends and residual wetlands, respectively. This habitat use suggests, considering the modelled habitat suitability, a very fragmented scenario, in which 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ movements may be hindered by missing connections among these different habitats; this phenomenon could be even more marked considering 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ low-dispersal capacity (
