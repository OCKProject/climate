<p class="p">The response curves obtained for the four most contributing variables suggest that a certain range of precipitation positively influence 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ modeled habitat suitability. In particular, the almost unimodal response trends to BIO16 and BIO19 can be interpreted taking into account the peculiarities of Mediterranean islands’ climate with respect to the habitats used by the target species during its entire life cycle, such as wetlands or slow-moving waterbodies. On one hand, the high predicted suitability corresponding to relatively low values of BIO16 is coherent with the environmental requirements of a species which is well acclimated to a Mediterranean island as Sicily, for which 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cannarozzo, Noto &amp; Viola (2006)</xref> showed historical negative trends in precipitation. These trends were observed especially in western and south-western parts of the island, corresponding to the greatest portion of the area predicted as highly suitable in the EMs obtained for current climate (

 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic> corresponding to low values of BIO19 well reflects the negative effect of decreasing winter precipitation, due to ongoing climate change, on different drivers of water availability, such as runoff and aquifers’ recharge, particularly pronounced in several Mediterranean islands (
