 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>; the discretization of the continuous maps resulting from the ensemble forecasting was carried out with a TSS maximization threshold = 0.604, which may be considered as very restrictive. The proportion of pseudo-absences which were assigned a habitat suitability value greater than the found TSS-max threshold is 11.5%, suggesting that a low number of pseudo-absences may be considered as potential false positives (i.e., good discriminative model performance).
