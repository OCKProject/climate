<p class="p">A general and extensive loss of areas predicted as suitable under current climate is observable throughout the study area for all the future scenarios, coupled with no relevant increase in suitability (i.e., Gain) in other territories. In the four different 2050 RCPs scenarios, area loss goes along with the increase of radiative forcing, with an exception for the 6.0 scenario. All the 2070 RCPs scenarios show a loss of suitable areas proportional to the radiative forcing increase, including in this case also the 6.0 scenario.</p>
