<p class="p">The assessment of the contribution for each predictor within the EMs resulted in a clear predominance of precipitation-linked bioclimatic variables. The amount of precipitation in the wettest quarter (BIO16), coldest quarter (BIO19) and warmest quarter (BIO18) represent the first, second and third most contributing variables, with 31.2%, 23.0% and 14.6% of the total contribution, respectively. The only temperature-related variable is temperature annual range (BIO7), with 9.6% of the total contribution. Response curves obtained for these four variables (
