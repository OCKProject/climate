<p class="p">The gap analysis performed on the PAs’ network and 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ presence sites resulted in 18 out of 39 records falling into PAs; this means that there are more than a half of the localities inhabited by the target species that are not covered by any form of legal protection. This trend pairs with the one emerging from the curves obtained through the gap analysis performed on the modelled habitat suitability for the current scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). In fact, approximately half of the PAs’ extent corresponds to areas predicted to be highly suitable (habitat suitability &gt; 0.8) for 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>, while the other protected half shows very low suitability (&lt;0.2). With respect to the modelled future scenarios, PAs are predicted to mainly preserve areas with low-to-medium suitability (habitat suitability between 0.2 and 0.5) in all scenarios except the 2050_6.0 one, which shows a higher proportion of protected extent corresponding to a medium-to-high habitat suitability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>). The 4.5 and 8.5 RCPs show for both 2050 and 2070 a marked peak in the protection of areas whose suitability ranges from 0.4 to 0.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Figs. 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">4D</xref>). Overall, the 2050 scenarios show a higher degree of protection for areas with higher predicted suitability, if compared to the curves obtained for the 2070 RCPs. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> shows that a high number (and extent) of PAs is located in the eastern part of the island, which is predicted to host low suitable areas for the target species in both the current and the future scenarios.
