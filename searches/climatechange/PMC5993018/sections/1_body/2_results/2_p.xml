<p class="p">Twenty-five models out of 200 exceeded both the TSS and AUC thresholds chosen, and were then selected as candidates for the ensemble modeling. The wmean EM showed high discrimination performance, with TSS = 0.885 and AUC = 0.972. Moreover, the high evaluation scores (TSS = 0.867 and AUC = 0.969) of the EM obtained through the median algorithm, which is less sensitive to outliers than the mean (
