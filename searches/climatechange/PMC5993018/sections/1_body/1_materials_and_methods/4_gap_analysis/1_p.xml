<p class="p">A gap analysis was performed in ArcMap 10.0 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) to assess 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ current and future status of protection, evaluating the overlap between the PAs network and two different sets of target species’ data. First, presence points falling within the PAs were considered to assess the protection status of existing populations; then, EMs’ outcomes for both current and future scenarios were intersected with existing PAs, and the intersection extents were calculated. The shapefile of the PAs’ network was downloaded from the geo-portal of the Italian Ministry of the Environment (

All marine PAs were excluded from the analyses.
