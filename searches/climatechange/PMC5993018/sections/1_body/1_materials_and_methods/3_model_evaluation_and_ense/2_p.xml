<p class="p">The gain, stability or loss of predicted suitable areas were calculated for each year × RCP scenario through the “BIOMOD_RangeSize” algorithm. Since this process needs binarized (i.e., presence/absence) maps, a binarization threshold was calculated through the “ecospat” R package (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di Cola et al., 2017</xref>), computing the threshold which maximizes the TSS (TSS-max) for each of the single ENMs selected to build the EMs and then averaging the different thresholds found. This procedure is particularly reliable when dealing with presence-background models, as it results in the same value of threshold that would be calculated from presence-absence models (
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu, White &amp; Newell, 2013</xref>). This threshold was also compared to the values of the EM predictions for the current scenario read on the pseudo-absences points generated during model building. This permitted us to assess the proportion of pseudo-absences corresponding to false positives in the TSS-based binarized EM for current climatic conditions. Binarization of maps was performed through the “Reclassify” tool in ArcMap 10.0 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA).
