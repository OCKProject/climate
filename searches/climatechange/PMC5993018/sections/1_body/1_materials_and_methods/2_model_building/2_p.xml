 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">R Core Team, 2016</xref>), was used to build the ENMs for 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>. In particular, Ensemble Models (EMs, i.e., models resulting from the combination of individual ENMs obtained through different modeling algorithms) were built for the current climatic conditions through the “BIOMOD_EnsembleModeling” function, and then projected to the future scenarios by means of the “BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting” function. Ten sets of 1,000 pseudo-absences each were generated through the Surface Range Envelope algorithm (

 <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reino et al., 2017</xref>), setting the quantile at 0.05 (i.e., pseudo-absences were randomly generated outside of the 95th quantile of the linear environmental envelope built on presence points): this strategy contributes to lower the probability of selecting pseudo-absences from suitable but uncolonized area, which would lead to increasing commission error (
