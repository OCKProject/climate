<p class="p">Such a shortage in the overall knowledge about 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic> has particular relevance with respect to its conservation status. This species, strictly endemic to Sicily Island, may be considered at risk of extinction for several reasons (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di Cerbo, 2011</xref>), including its low dispersal potential (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lo Valvo, D’Angelo &amp; Regina, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lo Valvo et al., 2014</xref>), the reduction in the number of populations and the scarce gene flow (
 <xref rid="ref-85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Turrisi, 2008</xref>). This species is also notably linked to aquatic environments, such as estuaries, wetlands and lentic habitats (

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di Cerbo, 2011</xref>), which are all highly threatened because of recent land use modifications and ongoing and future climate change (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The Mediterranean area, in fact, seems to be particularly sensitive to these modifications, which may bring to severe alterations in water balance (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Markovic et al. (2017)</xref> showed that the Mediterranean islands have the most vulnerable freshwater ecosystems, with respect to future climate change, if compared with those of continental Europe. However, notwithstanding these threats, it is interesting to note that the current European protected area network covers less than one quarter of the overall extent of the most vulnerable freshwater catchments (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Markovic et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, in Sicily Island the protection of the territory is relatively young: the first protected areas (PAs) were established in the 1980s, with most of them created in the middle 1990s and the last ones created in the context of the Natura 2000 project.
