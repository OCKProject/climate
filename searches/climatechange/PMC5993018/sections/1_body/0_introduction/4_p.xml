<p class="p">In this contribution, we report the results of a research, carried out by means of ENM techniques, on the possible climatic variables affecting

Starting from models based on the current climatic conditions, we inferred possible modifications in the future distribution of the Sicilian pond turtle across four different global warming scenarios. Finally, a gap analysis in GIS environment was performed taking into consideration the protected area network in Sicily and the current and future potential distribution of
