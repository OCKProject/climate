<p class="p">Stability in precipitation amount and temperature variations strongly affects 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris’</italic> suitable habitats. Considering the high contribution values of precipitation-related variables, the water balance of the aquatic sites inhabited by this species resulted to be of primary importance for its conservation, which is jeopardized by the ongoing process of climate change. Considering the RCP 2.6 within the modeling framework, even though it represents a no more plausible scenario of future radiative forcing, gave us the opportunity to investigate how the potential distribution of a species acclimated to the current Mediterranean environments could response to moderate warming. In fact, the noticeable stability of predicted suitable areas resulting for both 2050 and 2070 under this RCP is in opposition to the outcomes from the projections under the RCP 8.5, which instead reported high rates of loss of suitable areas. Thus, these two “boundary” RCPs might give important information about the responses of projected ENMs to diametrically opposed GHG emissions trajectories, and should be taken into consideration when modeling species’ distribution in relation to climate change. On the other side, the gaps in the PAs’ regional network revealed a critical situation for the conservation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>, showing the adversities that existing PAs will have to face in protecting both current presence localities and future suitable areas, with these latter which may be used as refuge areas. The highlighted management shortfall, coupled with the forecasts of future extreme meteorological events within the Mediterranean basin, clearly demonstrates the weakness of the current conservation status of this threatened endemic species. Therefore, PAs should actively look for adequate solutions to preserve the populations falling within their boundaries, such as direct (e.g., population monitoring) and indirect (e.g., water bodies management) conservation practices. Further, PAs should encourage field research activities, in order to improve the knowledge about the autoecological features of the species and look for possible disturbances (e.g., invasive alien species). With respect to 
 <italic class="italic">E. trinacris</italic>’ populations (and areas with high suitability) outside PAs, local managers and stakeholders should take into consideration the possibility of ad-hoc conservation measures.
