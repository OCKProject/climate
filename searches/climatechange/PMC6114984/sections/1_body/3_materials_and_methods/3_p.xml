<p class="p">Next, we converted projected changes in range size to changes in carrying capacity for each species stock over time (see the Supplementary Materials). An annual carrying capacity was calculated by interpolating between each 5-year interval. These changes in carrying capacity then drove predictable changes in maximum sustainable yield. Changes in range size cannot be projected for NEI stocks using the same methodologies, since they are composites of several species. To determine the carrying capacity trajectory for NEI stocks, we first aggregated total range by nation (including all species with range in a given nation) for each 5-year interval and then interpolated to obtain the annual aggregate range values for each nation. We then calculated annual changes in aggregate range for each nation, relative to year 2012. These relative changes were then applied to NEI stock carrying capacities. Finally, we projected future biomass, harvest, and profit under different management and climate scenarios using a bioeconomic model (

This modeling approach was modified from the original by incorporating the unique stream of future carrying capacity values over time for each species and NEI stock (see the Supplementary Materials). Each year, biomass was calculated using a modified Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model, incorporating the projected carrying capacity in each time step (
