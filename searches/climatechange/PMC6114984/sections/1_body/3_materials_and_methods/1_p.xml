<p class="p">We examined the implications of climate change and management reform for 779 species stocks and 136 NEI stocks (mixed-species fisheries aggregated at the country level) located across the globe (see the Supplementary Materials for aggregation methods). To make these projections, we required estimates of the fishery’s current status and level of exploitation, as well as data on the current species’ distribution to forecast responses to climate velocity. To conform to the spatial resolution of the climate velocity model, we modeled each species as a single “stock” and referred to these as “species stocks.” The 779 species stocks are comparatively data-rich relative to the global pool of fisheries. To explore a more globally representative sample, we also included 136 stocks aggregated at the country level that represent NEI stocks, as defined in Costello
