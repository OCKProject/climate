<p class="p">We modeled future (2015–2100) species distributions by projecting changes from current (2012) presence-absence species distribution maps derived from AquaMaps (

  <italic class="italic">30</italic>

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>). This method assumes that species ranges track climate, expanding or contracting their range to keep up with changes in their thermal niche, conditioned to their inferred thermal and depth tolerances. To improve on the original model (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>), species’ trajectories were restricted based on the species’ depth range (
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>) using global bathymetry data (ETOPO2v2 2-Minute Gridded Global Relief Data). Briefly, each cell within a species’ range was spatially projected forward in time based on corresponding mean annual sea surface temperature isotherm trajectories (
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">31</italic>
 </xref>). Isotherm trajectories were dictated by the speed and direction of cell-specific climate velocities (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>), based on multimodel ensemble means for the four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCPs: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 (see the Supplementary Materials). Species’ ranges were recalculated at the end of each 5-year interval based on those trajectories and species’ thermal tolerance and depth range (see the Supplementary Materials).
