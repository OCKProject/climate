<p class="p">We apply the appropriate harvest rates prescribed by these four management alternatives to 915 single- and mixed-species stocks across the globe that have adequate data to both assess their current status and forecast their future distributions. The majority (779) consist of stocks of individual species (species stocks). The remainder (136) are mixed-species aggregations (NEI stocks—Food and Agriculture Organization Not-Elsewhere Included fisheries). Cumulatively, these 915 species stocks or NEI stocks (hereafter collectively referred to as “stocks”) represent 67% of total current global catch (

We focus mostly on the moderately high-emission scenario, RCP 6.0, under which global mean temperature is expected to increase by 2.2°C by 2100 (
