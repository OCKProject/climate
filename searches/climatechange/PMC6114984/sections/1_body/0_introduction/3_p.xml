<p class="p">To explore the potential range of human responses to climate change, we analyze four management scenarios that bound human responses to the dual challenges of range and productivity shifts: (i) Full Adaptation, (ii) Range Shift Adaptation, (iii) Productivity Adaptation, and (iv) No Adaptation. The Full Adaptation scenario assumes that management addresses both productivity and range shift challenges. Thus, we apply an economically optimal harvest policy that maximizes long-term economic benefits to each stock (

 </xref>). This dynamic harvest control rule optimally adjusts fishing mortality on the basis of available biomass and is therefore naturally adaptive to climate-driven productivity changes. In this scenario, we assume that management also addresses challenges posed by shifting stocks (for example, through new proactive institutions, such as effective transboundary agreements), ensuring that effective management does not degrade because of spatial shifts. Therefore, under this management scenario, all species, including those expected to shift across management boundaries, are managed with an optimized harvest control rule. Conversely, the No Adaptation scenario assumes that neither climate challenge is addressed. In this scenario, the current fishing mortality rate is initially applied to all stocks but is only maintained for those that do not shift across EEZs. Management for those that shift gradually transitions to open access, where fishing mortality is driven by short-term profits. Both the looming departure of a stock and the emergence of a new stock motivate this shift in management. The length of this transition for each stock depends on how quickly it is expected to experience a range shift across EEZs. The Full Adaptation and No Adaptation scenarios bookend the possible future outcomes for global fisheries.
