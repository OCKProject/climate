<p class="p">Oceans provide enormous benefits to people (

  <italic class="italic">4</italic>
 </xref>). While instructive for assessing what could theoretically be possible, focusing on changes in maximum potential food production alone overlooks the effects of alternative human responses to climate change, which could either limit or exacerbate ecosystem changes. The actions of fishermen, management institutions, and markets can all influence the magnitude of fisheries benefits obtained from an ecosystem (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). Here, we ask: What are the potential benefits of adaptive fisheries management reforms that address anticipated consequences of changes in species productivity and distribution due to climate change? We examine how future global biomass, harvest, and profit of the world’s fisheries might change over time if a range of potential human responses and climate change are considered together.
