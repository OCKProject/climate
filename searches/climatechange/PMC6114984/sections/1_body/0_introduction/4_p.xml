<p class="p">The two intermediate scenarios separately address one of the two challenges explored in this paper. The Range Shift Adaptation scenario assumes that management addresses challenges posed by shifting stocks but lacks a response to changes in productivity. Under this management scenario, the current fishing mortality rate is maintained for all stocks, as it ensures that current management does not degrade because of spatial shifts and does not benefit from an optimal harvest rule. Productivity Adaptation manages for fisheries productivity changes that affect population dynamics and potential yields but takes no actions to address range shift challenges. Therefore, the economically optimal harvest rule is only applied to species for which climate change is not expected to cause border crossings. For all other stocks, we apply a harvest rule that gradually shifts from the economically optimal fishing mortality rate to the rate expected under open access (see the “Policy alternatives” section in the Supplementary Materials for details on all policies). These management scenarios, while broad and, in some cases, idealistic, can provide general insights into how a range of approaches to climate challenges might affect future biomass, harvest, and profit.</p>
