 </xref>). Although climate effects are diverse, the impacts on global fisheries can be clustered into two broad categories: changes in stock productivity, which affect potential yields and profits, and changes in stock distributions, which affect where fish can be caught and who might catch them. These changes pose distinct management challenges. Responding to changes in fisheries productivity requires harvest policies that are appropriately adaptive to changing demographics. For example, banded morwong and many other species in the Tasman Sea have already experienced noticeable changes in their population sizes driven by rapid warming (

  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>). Failure to adequately address these changes can further exacerbate management failures. By contrast, changes in species distributions (

  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>,

  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>) can move stocks into and out of management jurisdictions, such as countries’ exclusive economic zones (EEZs), altering management jurisdiction and incentives for those stocks. A perceived or anticipated decline of a stock due to a range shift out of one country creates an incentive to overharvest before it leaves the nation’s waters (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, as a stock enters a new EEZ or the high seas, a new and potentially unmanaged fishery emerges. If left unaddressed, these range shift challenges can drive overharvesting, even in fisheries that are currently managed effectively. For example, until 2009, North East Atlantic mackerel was well managed under a trilateral agreement between Norway, the Faroe Islands, and the European Union. However, because of shifts in migration patterns, Iceland suddenly became a key contender in the fishery and maximized its newfound access to a valuable fishery. Since countries could not agree on appropriate quota allocations, management was compromised. By 2010, mackerel harvest was 40% above safe biological recommendations (
