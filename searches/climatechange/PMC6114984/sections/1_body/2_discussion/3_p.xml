<p class="p">Our analyses suggest that the benefits of enacting reforms today are cumulatively large enough to counter the future deleterious impacts of projected changes in fisheries productivity for most RCPs. Achieving this improved outcome is no small task since it involves reforms for many stocks with distinct fishery characteristics, each often fished by multiple countries. Management that flexibly adapts to productivity changes may require more frequent data collection and management updates, which can be costly. Fortunately, three factors help make a more prosperous future less daunting. First, case studies suggest that reform is possible for a range of fishery types, including high seas, large-scale, small-scale, data-rich, and data-poor. Pons

  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>) found that high seas stocks under some form of management (generally commercially important species such as tuna) have shown improvements in biomass and decreases in fishing mortality over the last 10 years. In addition, management reforms in both large-scale fisheries (for example, Peruâ€™s individual vessel quota reform for the anchoveta fishery) and small-scale fisheries (for example, fishery reforms in Mexico and Chile) suggest that reform is possible in many contexts, although specific interventions might vary depending on fishery characteristics (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">20</italic>
 </xref>). These examples also suggest that even countries with more limited resources are capable of greatly improving their fisheries management. Second, the necessary fishery reforms do not require the threat of climate change as motivation. Adaptive harvest rules that respond to available biomass can provide large benefits in both static and changing climates (

  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>). Therefore, reforms motivated purely by benefits today may also help buffer against negative productivity changes in the future. The third factor promoting improved global outcomes is the highly skewed distribution of fishery sizes. Because of the large variation in stock sizes, a large percentage of the potential global economic gains in this study can be achieved through the targeted reform of large overfished stocks. In our analysis, less than 10% of global stocks would need to adopt the most comprehensive reforms for future global profit to exceed current global profit. Therefore, although achieving the full benefits of global fisheries reform is an ambitious goal, strategic targeting of reform efforts could still generate major global benefits. Furthermore, a targeting approach that incorporates fishery size, value, and vulnerability to climate change may help to efficiently direct resources toward fisheries with the greatest potential for improved outcomes.
