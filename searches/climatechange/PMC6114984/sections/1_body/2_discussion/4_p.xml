<p class="p">The second decision we will have to make is how to respond to shifting ranges. Spatial shifts across management boundaries can undermine well-designed policies and render promising management approaches unsuccessful. Transboundary fisheries already pose significant management challenges today and are often in worse shape than fisheries that reside entirely within individual countries’ waters (

 </xref>). Designing institutions to address this inherently human challenge will be crucial given the extent of projected movement of fish stocks and the potentially enormous costs of inadequate responses. While it is encouraging that spatial and temporal stock structure is already measured in some cases, the existence of this information does not guarantee that this information will influence management decisions. In addition, accurately predicting where and when fish distributions will shift may be difficult. Therefore, international institutions and agreements will need to be flexible and robust in the face of uncertainty to effectively cope with these management disruptions as they arise. Improved international collaboration will be needed to adequately address climate-induced threats not only to fisheries but also to other natural resources for which climate change will have spatial and transboundary implications (
