<p class="p">Climate change will have diverse impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. Prior projections that climate change could reduce global fisheries revenues by as much as $10 billion a year compared to today garnered significant attention (

We show that the future of global fisheries could actually be more prosperous than today, but only if management reforms addressing current mismanagement and looming challenges from climate change are implemented in the near future across a wide range of fisheries. This is true both globally and for nearly half of the individual stocks analyzed. The future of fisheries, however, could also be much worse than prior projections suggested if appropriate adaptations to potential productivity changes and climate-driven movement of species across management boundaries are not made. Maladaptive responses to the pending loss of a fishery or the arrival of a new fishery could exacerbate the previously projected direct effects of climate change.
