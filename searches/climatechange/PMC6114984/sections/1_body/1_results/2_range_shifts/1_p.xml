<p class="p">The percentage of species stocks that shift across country boundaries by 2100 increases with the severity of the climate projection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The percentage of individual species that will shift across EEZs ranges from 36% (RCP 2.6) to 81% (RCP 8.5). These shifting stocks comprise between 27.8 and 71.7% of the current global MSY. Under RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, most species that shift across EEZs experience shifts both into new and out of old EEZs (
