<p class="p">While these results show that adapting to climate change delivers far better outcomes than not adapting, we can also compare future outcomes to what is obtained today. Even in the presence of the net negative effects of climate change, the Full Adaptation policy could deliver higher total profit, harvest, and biomass (increases of 27, 16, and 29%, respectively) than what the oceans provide today (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Increases over today for all three indicators are only attained when both kinds of management changes are pursued together. Productivity Adaptation alone can slightly increase harvest but not profit or biomass, while Range Shift Adaptation alone can slightly increase biomass but not profit or harvest. No Adaptation results in far lower profits, harvest, and biomass compared to what is achieved today. Under the most extreme climate scenario (RCP 8.5), Full Adaptation can no longer generate outcomes that are better than today in all three metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and fig. S1). These patterns of outcomes relative to today generally hold for alternative assumptions regarding global stock composition, the definition of a shifting stock, prices, and costs, and across the range of climate projections (figs. S1 and S5 to S7).
