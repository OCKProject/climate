<p class="p">We find that adopting proactive and adaptive fishery management approaches today would lead to substantially higher global profits (154%), harvest (34%), and biomass (60%) in the future compared to No Adaptation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Simultaneously addressing both range shift and productivity changes generates much greater benefits in profits, harvest, and biomass than focusing on either challenge alone. Similar trends are observed across all RCPs, where a fully adaptive strategy produces consistently large increases in all three parameters compared to No Adaptation (fig. S1). Productivity or Range Shift Adaptation alone produces intermediate benefits.
