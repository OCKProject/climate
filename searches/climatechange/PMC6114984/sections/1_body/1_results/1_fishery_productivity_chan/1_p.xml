<p class="p">Total global fisheries maximum sustainable yield (MSY) does not change markedly by 2100 under three of the four RCPs. Global MSY (weighted mean) is expected to change by 1.0, −1.5, −5.0, and −25.0% under RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). These modest global changes in productivity under the three lower RCPs, however, mask enormous variation in changes across stocks. While some stocks essentially go extinct (MSY declines by 100%), others increase by more than 35% under RCP 6.0. Overall, approximately 41, 53, 66, and 91% of global stocks experience a projected decline in total MSY by 2100 under RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively.
