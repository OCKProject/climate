<p class="p">Although Full Adaptation results in a global win across nearly all RCPs and all three indicators, not all individual stocks see improvements relative to today (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Whether a stock benefits in the future relative to today from climate-adaptive and proactive management depends on both ecosystem changes (projected magnitude and direction of productivity and range changes) and the fishery’s current status. To highlight the role of current stock status, we categorize each species into one of four groups: (i) Healthy, (ii) Emerging, (iii) Recovering, and (iv) Overfished (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> for definitions). Under Full Adaptation, nearly all Healthy stocks see a decrease in biomass by 2100, because this group is currently underexploited relative to its maximum potential production. Although biomass decreases for these stocks, there is an increase in harvest as the species become fully exploited. Emerging stocks will almost exclusively see harvest decreases, even when climate change is inconsequential, because these stocks are currently in a “fishing down” period with harvests significantly higher than their MSY. Most Recovering stocks see increases in biomass and harvest, since stock recovery supports higher yields after the stock is rebuilt and subsequently fished sustainably. Most Overfished stocks see declines in harvest but increases in biomass, as current harvest levels are unsustainably high. Although only 22% of stocks will experience future increases in both harvest and biomass, this subgroup includes some of the highest-yield stocks and cumulatively makes up about half of the total global yield.
