<p class="p">The inclusion of these higher scoring papers later in the period of analysis has biased the result to the null, that is, away from the hypothesis that fewer such papers were published from about 2000. The most influential of these 17 papers, judged by Google Scholar citations, was cited 272 times.

It was scored as two (perhaps generously) and was included because it was judged that to exclude it would bias the result away from the null hypothesis.
