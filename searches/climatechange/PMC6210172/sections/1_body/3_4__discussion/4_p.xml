<p class="p">This may also be the first review paper concerning climate change and health to use a citation analysis [
 <xref rid="B111-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] as an indicator of influence. Citations in Google Scholar were used for convenience and cost. Although such citations are prone to error, and include essays in the gray literature, they still reflect influence. Some reports in the gray literature may be more widely read and more influential than more scholarly work.
