<p class="p">In recent years the science concerning the physical impacts of climate has continued to expand and to disturb. Average global temperatures continue to rise [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], apparently in a process more “stepped” than as a trend [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] with record average global heat in both El Niño and La Niña years. Loss of ice from both Antarctica and Greenland is increasing and the rate of sea level rise is consequently accelerating [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Property values in parts of the U.S. East Coast may soon fall, due to sea level rise [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. There is growing concern about more intense rainfall [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], fires worsened by heat and drought [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], a weakening Gulf Stream [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and increased sinuosity of the jet stream, which can cause unusual cold at lower latitudes, even if the average global temperature is rising [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02266" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The projected trend toward a weaker and poleward-shifted jet stream is also consistent with projections of a significantly increased risk of worsening extreme heat and dryness in the Northern Hemisphere [
