<p class="p">Citation data were available for 2105 papers (98%). Over 201,000 citations were identified by Google Scholar (see 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02266-t0A3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table A3</xref> in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-ijerph-15-02266" class="xref">Appendix</xref>). Thirty two percent of these citations were for papers published since 2009 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02266-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Of these citations, the great majority (82%) were for papers scored as one, each of which was cited an average of 107 times. Papers scored 2 were cited an average of 73 times, representing 15% of the total. Papers scored as three were cited 35 times each on average and accounted for 3% of the total. The difference in these citation scores is also statistically significant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02266-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The fraction of the literature discussing existential risk remained lower in the last 5 years of this database than in the first five years (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02266-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The shift in the ratio of annual citations from the early period to the more recent years is evident in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02266-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Until 1991, the majority of citations were for papers scored as three. From 1994 the fraction of citations for papers scored as three was almost zero (3% or less) in every year until 2009. In 2013 it again fell to 3%.
