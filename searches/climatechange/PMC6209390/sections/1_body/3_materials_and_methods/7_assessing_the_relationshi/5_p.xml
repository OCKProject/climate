<p class="p">The area where rice is grown in China expanded by 6.2 million hectares between 1949 and 1958 alone (

 </xref>). Between roughly 1960 and 1970, the introduction of dwarf varieties followed by hybrid rice further extended the area in which rice was cultivated. With the exception of a few cells, the distribution of rice is confined to the area south of the Yangtze River valley. Some low probability cells in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang represent expansions of the area under cultivation during the Great Leap Forward and following the introduction of new types of rice. Our analysis uses GDD values for nonhybrid and nondwarf varieties of rice. The extended range that post-1970 varieties are able to occupy may partially explain why a small percentage of rice occupies an area that is in lower niche probabilities (
