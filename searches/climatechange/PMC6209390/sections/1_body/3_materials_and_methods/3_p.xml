<p class="p">We used temperature to examine how the crop niche changed over time for several reasons. (i) It is a primary limiting variable: This means that the extent of the crop niche cannot be increased by adding water. Our reconstructions should thus be interpreted as the maximum niche that might have been occupied by these cropsâ€”a niche that could be further reduced by limiting water. (ii) It is challenging to model how precipitation changed in the past as there are no accurate and high spatial resolution models for Asia that extend over this period of the Holocene.</p>
