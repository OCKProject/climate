<p class="p">All C-14 dates were calibrated using the IntCal13 calibration curve and the BchronCalibrate function available from the Bchron package version 4.2.6 in R (
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">49</italic>
 </xref>). Calibrated probability density curves for all dates from each site/component were then summed and normalized to one to generate estimated occupations for each site (this is congruent to the Oxcal SUM command). Sites that only had estimated date ranges were assigned a flat distribution (also normalized to one). We established site occupation spans as the 95% confidence interval of the date distribution; estimated site occupation spans for all site occupations are presented in table S2.
