<p class="p">To examine how changing temperatures could have affected the ability of farmers to grow each crop, we used a global record of Holocene temperatures (

 </xref>). We established crop niches by thresholding annual GDDs, a measure of the accumulated units of heat required by plants to complete their life cycle, for a variety of crops (table S1). We then used indicator kriging to spatially interpolate these niches across the ETOPO5 5 arc min (c. 10 km) resolution elevation model (

 </xref>,

 </xref>). Indicator kriging uses binary observations at discrete locations (such as whether a measurement exceeds a given threshold, as here) to interpolate the probability that the given threshold will be met or exceeded across a grid.
