<p class="p">We assembled chronometric data from 423 sites for the presence of different crops across our study area with a total of 1187 entries over 485 distinct occupations. Finds of crops were derived from site reports, publications on archaeobotanical remains, or compilations of radiocarbon dates (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
 </xref>). Where available, we collected associated or direct radiocarbon dates on crop remains from each site—our database currently includes 908 radiocarbon dates covering 190 sites. For sites lacking radiocarbon dates, we used established age range estimates for agricultural occupation periods reported in the literature. In cases where we had both radiocarbon dates and age estimates, we used the radiocarbon dates to reestimate occupation ranges (see below). We also excluded records for which we could not find accurate site location data (see data file S3 for details). The chronometric dataset used in our analysis is presented in table S2, with associated references. Because of the sensitive nature of archaeological site locations, table S2 does not include locational data; the entire dataset—including data excluded from the present analysis because they were from sites outside of our study area, or crops not discussed here—is archived in the Digital Archaeological Record (ID: 428089) at
