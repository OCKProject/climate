<p class="p">Although systematically derived archaeological data for storage are lacking in later periods in China, we know through textual sources that early states played an increasingly important role in extracting grain through taxation and redistributing this grain in times of hunger. A source describing agricultural strategies in Anhui, north-central China, that was composed c. 2000 BP states: “On average the state should be able to save a year’s surplus from every three years crop…so that despite natural disasters the people will not suffer misery or destruction. A state that does not have [at least] nine years stored is said to have insufficient food, one which does not have six years is said to be in peril and one which does not have three years is said to be in desperate straits” (
