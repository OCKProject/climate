<p class="p">The amount of storage carried out at these different sites mirrors somewhat the challenges they faced in returns. At Tuzusai and Taldy Balak in Kazakhstan, individual households appear to have stored roughly a year and a half of crops: Compared to Jiangzhai, we see a more substantial investment in buffering against risk. They stored slightly more crops than would have been necessary to survive on over the course of a year. We know that individuals at both sites also heavily supplemented their diet through resources derived from pastoralism, meaning that these resources lasted them even longer (

 </xref>). For wheat and barley, Tuzusai is located at an 85 to 96% probability of being in the niche, whereas millets were between 64 and 75%. The year and half of available storage closely mirrors the probability of success of wheat and barley. The inhabitants of the site likely further increased their resilience to variable returns not only by either trading in or farming a riskier crop such as millet but also through buffering by reliance on pastoral products.
