<p class="p">Some examples of household-level storage pits exist in the archaeological record of Asia; however, collating a record of the levels of storage used by individuals across Asia has been complicated for several reasons. Only a few archaeological publications contain sufficient detail on the households (and hence number of persons) with which these storage units are associated. We review the evidence for household-level storage from three datasets: (i) data from the early agricultural site of Jiangzhai (7000 to 6000 cal. BP) in the Yellow River valley of China (

 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>), and (iii) a very complete record of Korean household-level storage in pits assembled by Bale (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>) for sites ranging across the Mumum period (2900 to 2450 cal. BP). These datasets range widely both across regions and time periods.
