<p class="p">In the Korean dataset, the median number of years of storage was 1.8 years; however, a wider variability existed, with a number of sites having over 20 years of storage, such as Majeon-ri (c. 2750 to 2350 cal. BP). Korean sites appear to have been largely within the niche for these dryland crops during the Mumum period (89 to 91%); however, for rice, a crop that was also cultivated at these sites, the probability of success was far lower. Their ability to withstand variability in crop returns via reliance on storage was higher than both early Yangshao and Kazakh sites, and this may have been a function of the higher variability in returns derived from rice. While they practiced crop diversification to buffer against risk, inhabitants of these Korean sites do not appear to have relied on pastoral resources. Storage likely became an increasingly important way of dealing with risk.</p>
