<p class="p">Our analysis shows that, for most sites in our database, farmers tolerated extremely low levels of risk, particularly before 4000 cal. BP; 88.4% of sites have median probabilities of a successful harvest greater than 0.75. The trans-Eurasian exchange in crops took place during a period of time where thermal conditions were favorable to the cultivation of these crops. Following an initial climatic downturn c. 4000 to 3750 cal. BP, millet farmers in high-latitude and high-altitude Asia, who faced challenges with dwindling returns, began to innovate with systems of crop diversification following the introduction of wheat and barley. Trade may also have played an important role during this period of time. An even colder interval c. 1690 cal. BP, which began to make millet farming challenging in even central China, leads farmers to diversify their holdings and to finally shift toward consuming larger amounts of wheat and barley. Our crop niche models demonstrate that following 2000 cal. BP, the development of deeper trade networks fueled by pastoralist groups leads to the movement of grains well outside of areas where they could be cultivated. It is following this date that the exchanges across Central and high-altitude Asia coalesced to form the Silk Roadâ€”an adaptive network of exchange that included domesticated crops and that allowed humans to occupy areas well outside of the niche of any grain crop on a more permanent basis.</p>
