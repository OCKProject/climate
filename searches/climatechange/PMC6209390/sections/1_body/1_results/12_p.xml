<p class="p">Despite these crops already falling out of their climatic niches in China’s higher-altitude margins after 4000 cal. BP, farmers in the warmer low-lying north-central China continued to rely heavily on millets. Wheat and barley remained minor components of the diet of north-central China up until 200 CE (

 </xref>). However, following 200 CE, wheat and barley move from being minor crops to food staples in northern China. Rotary querns are also introduced to northern China during this period of time, suggesting that similar ways of processing wheat and barley also began to make their way over from China’s peripheries (

 </xref>). We argue not only that this shift in dietary strategies in northern China took place as a result of a gradual change in culinary preference (

 </xref>) but also that increasingly higher risk associated with growing millet led farmers in northern China to experiment with the multicropping strategies and pastoralism that were already used on their margins. This shift was likely facilitated by contact with groups more heavily invested in pastoralism such as the Xianbei, who moved into this area and who may have already been engaged in low-level cultivation of these crops on China’s margins.
