<p class="p">Between 6000 and 4000 cal. BP, the probability of being in the thermal niche ranges between 100 and 90% for sites with millet and barley, suggesting that temperature did not form an impediment to their spread. During the early years of cultivation of all these crops, farmers exploited them conservatively and cultivated these crops in areas that had a high or, in most cases, almost certain probability of success (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This high probability of success is mirrored in the storage data from central China during this period of time. Individuals stored roughly half a year of grain cropsâ€”a quantity that a family (that was also reliant on foraging) might have consumed over the course of a year, reserving some seeds for planting for the following years (see Materials and methods).
