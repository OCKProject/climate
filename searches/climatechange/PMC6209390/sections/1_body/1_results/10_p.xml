<p class="p">An event at c. 2000 cal. BP is the point when the largest changes take place in the crop niche for all six crops. For wheat and barley, large parts of the Tibetan Plateau become very cold and fall out of the thermal niche, as do the Tian Shan and Altai mountains (

BP (260 CE), almost the entire area corresponding to Mongolia falls outside of the thermal niche. Wheat and barley also experience difficulties in northern China. By 1670 cal. BP, broomcorn and foxtail millet completely lose their niche not only on the Tibetan Plateau but also across much of northwestern China (Outer and Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and North Korea); even parts of central China fall within the area that corresponds to the lower confidence interval (
