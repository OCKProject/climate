<p class="p">Millets could also have arrived at low probability sites via exchange with individuals occupying lower and warmer elevations. Archaeologists have often assumed that seeds found on an archaeological site were grown in the immediate vicinity of the site. It has been difficult for archaeologists to determine whether plant remains found on archaeological sites were locally grown because of a lack of understanding where the limits of their cultivation lay or how these limits changed with changing climates. When crops are locally cultivated, they are often found in association with crop-processing debris. In many societies, crop processing takes place on a daily basis, which results in the distribution of crop-processing waste across the site (

However, at Tuzusai in Kazakhstan (2360 to 2100 cal. BP), where such data have been reported, no crop-processing debris was found at the site for wheat and barley. Spengler

 </xref>) interprets this lack of chaff as being due to crop processing taking place off site; however, it is also possible that this indicates that the inhabitants may have derived their crops through increasing networks of trade and exchange that had begun to develop in the area. Crop-processing remains of millet can only be documented through the microbotanical record, and more work on this front is necessary to determine whether these crops were locally grown or rather traded into the area.
