<p class="p">Wheat and barley appear on the SETP several hundred years after millet-producing sites had already been abandoned—not giving farmers an opportunity to integrate these new grains into the diet (

 </xref>). On the NETP, however, wheat and barley arrived before the 4000 cal. BP cool down. Following 4000 cal. BP, millets begin to form a much smaller percentage of total grains found at a given site and are largely replaced by wheat and barley. We argue that faced with cooling climatic conditions, farmers on the NETP used a risk reduction strategy based on grain crop diversification to include cold-tolerant wheat and barley. Given the high probability of millet’s failure and the lack of available warm days for temporal diversification throughout the year, we argue that it is likely that farmers used a spatial diversification strategy—planting wheat and barley on cooler slopes and millets in warmer basins. This strategy allowed farmers to continue to cultivate millets on a small-scale basis even as their probability of failure rose sometimes to 30% (
