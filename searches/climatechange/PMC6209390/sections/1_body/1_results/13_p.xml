<p class="p">Our model demonstrates that after 2000 cal. BP is the first time that grains begin to appear at a number of sites (such as Mebrak, Kyung-Lung Mesa, Huang Niangniangtai, and several grottoes along the Silk Road), where probabilities of a successful harvest are less than 50% (

It is unlikely that the inhabitants of these sites attempted to grow crops in these areas, making trade and exchange a plausible solution for explaining the appearance of grain at these sites. This possibility is not surprising, particularly for several key sites on the Tibetan Plateau, like Kyung-lung Mesa and Ding-dun, where we know that nomadic pastoralism formed an important component of the economy (

This represents another form of spatial diversification (exchange in items like salt, fur, hide, meat, and milk for grain with individuals situated in areas of lower altitude) that grew in importance in high-altitude and high-latitude Eurasia throughout time. In the ethnographic present, Tibetan pastoralists engage in networks of trade that bring products produced hundreds of kilometers away into their settlements (
