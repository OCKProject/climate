<p class="p">Systematic archaeobotany has not been carried out at large numbers of sites dating to the historic period; however, textual records show that this period also corresponds to a substantial retreat of the Han dynasty out of Central Asia. Between 1660 and 1633 BP (290 to 317 CE), a massive southward migration began after the Jin dynasty became too weak to resist the constant incursions of “barbarians” (“Hu”) along their northern margins (

By 1633 BP (317 CE), the dynasty abandoned Chang’an and established itself in Nanjing (Jiankang) in Jiangsu—an area, while at the border of our lower confidence interval, that still fell within the niche not only for millets but also for wheat and barley. Xianbei pastoralists capture the north entirely by 1564 BP (386 CE) and rename themselves the northern Wei dynasty (

The creation of the Grand Canal during the Sui dynasty (1369 to 1332 BP or 581 to 618 CE) served the purpose of transporting grain produced in southern China from Hangzhou in south central China to Luoyang, Chang’an, and to the northern border near Beijing—an ingenious technological development for providing reliable access to food in areas marginal for grain production.
