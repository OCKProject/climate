<p class="p">A decline in the thermal niche of both broomcorn and foxtail millet takes place around 3800 cal. BP, particularly in the higher-altitude areas of the Tibetan Plateau, Tianshan and Altai mountains, and Inner Mongolia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). How did millet farmers cope with this high probability of failure following 4000 cal. BP? In the Liao River Basin, the numbers of millet remains present in archaeological sites decrease following 3000 BP and major changes in settlement distribution are seen during the Upper Xiajiadian period (

 </xref>). On the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), the impacts of this cooling episode appear to have been catastrophic: Many sites in the region appear to have been abandoned during this period of time. However, in equally affected parts of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP), at one site in Central Tibet and two sites in Central Asia (Tasbas and Tuzusai), finds of millets persist despite being at only a 60 to 70% probability of being in the thermal niche (
