<p class="p">These crops may have been exchanged along several different routes. A number of sites line up with a route that is consistent with the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (

For wheat and barley, a large and almost simultaneous cluster of sites across northern India makes a route to the south of the Himalayas route equally plausible—one that has been suggested by previous researchers as playing an important role (movies S1 and S2) (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>). This route, however, is truncated by a lack of archaeobotanical research in Assam, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. A third route for these crops’ transmission has been proposed—a route to the north of the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor. While this area remained within the thermal niche during the early years of these crops’ transmission, there is no archaeological evidence in our database to support crops moving along this route. It is worth noting that this route is also not supported by genetic evidence on barley landraces (
