<p class="p">We use a high spatial and temporal resolution model of the changing thermal crop niche for six grain crops across Central, South, and East Asia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) combined with a large (1187-entry) database that charts both the appearance and timing of use of broomcorn, foxtail millet, wheat, barley, buckwheat, and rice (see Materials and methods for details about the model and database). We use this niche model to examine the impact that changing temperatures had on humanâ€™s ability to subsist on these crops and to reveal the strategies they used to cope with these potential challenges. This model covers a wider geographic scope and temporal depth and more crop varieties than previously published thermal niche models (
