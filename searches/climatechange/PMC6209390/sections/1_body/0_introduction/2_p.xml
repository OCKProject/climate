<p class="p">Between 5000 and 1500 years ago, economic systems across Eurasia experienced major shifts as farming spread into areas far outside of its original centers of domestication. Throughout this period, humans also dealt with notable episodes of climatic change that affected agricultural returns. During this period of time, broomcorn and foxtail millet made their way from China to Central Asia, and wheat and barley moved from Central Asia to the Far East. Who spread these crops across Asia—when, how, and by what routes—has been a topic of increasing debate (
