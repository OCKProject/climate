<p class="p">While we donâ€™t profess to have all the answers, we believe there is growing evidence to support the argument that the factors driving climate change are the same as those driving corporate greed, excessive individual wealth creation, inequalities and all the other wicked problems our society faces. Hence if we can better understand and change these underlying factors we may not only reduce the impact of climate change on children and young people, but our whole society will be a better place for all. Our intention here is to help raise awareness of these issues and to urge others in the research and health sectors to get involved in the conversations and actions aimed at protecting and bettering the futures of the children of today and tomorrow.</p>
