 <xref rid="B24-children-02-00412" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Although more research is required at the regional and local levels in order to better understand, prepare for and adapt, the health and other challenges posed by climate change are becoming increasingly clear. Those living near rivers (more frequent and intense floods), seasonally arid areas (increased drought and bushfires) and areas prone to water scarcity are likely to be most affected [
 <xref rid="B22-children-02-00412" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Climate change has and is expected to further amplify the social gradient in health leading to even greater health inequity because the people who are, and will continue to be, among the first and most affected are the poor and disadvantaged who have higher disease burdens and less resources with which to protect themselves [
