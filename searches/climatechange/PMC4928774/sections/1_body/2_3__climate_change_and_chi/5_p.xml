They are smaller, have immature development and immune systems, have higher metabolic and respiratory rates, and a higher intake per unit body mass. They are likely to spend more time outdoors in vigorous activity which will increase exposures and are less capable of avoiding unhealthy situations. Their ability to handle infections, toxins and other exposures is limited.
