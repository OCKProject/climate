The ecological changes brought about by climate change are likely to manifest their effects through decreases in the availability of food and clean water causing malnutrition, diarrhoea, poor growth and developmental delays in early childhood and increases in allergens causing allergies and asthma [

 <xref rid="B35-children-02-00412" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Such outcomes are already on the increase in areas of China which are also suffering high levels of environmental pollution due to high levels of smoke from fossil fuels in the atmosphere in large urban areas. This highlights the fact that mitigating climate change by reducing fossil fuel use has both direct (via reduced pollution, 
 <italic class="italic">etc.</italic>) and indirect (via reduced harm from climate change) benefits for child health. Changing temperatures and environments are also resulting in increases in infectious diseases with some infections which only occurred in tropical areas moving into more temperate zones and also new emerging infections appear on the increase [
