<p class="p">There is no doubt that there has been a major increase in financial wellbeing over the last 100 years and that capitalism has contributed to the improved situations of millions of families world-wide. However over the last 20–30 years, as capitalism has become more extreme and focused solely on wealth creation, we have observed a range of dramatically increasing wicked problems affecting children and youth in the wealthiest countries. Suicide rates and mental health problems in young people quadrupled in Australia from 1980 to the 2000s; behavioural problems and learning disabilities have dramatically increased along with asthma and obesity. Many of the wealthiest countries have the highest inequalities across their societies which are extremely detrimental to family, child and youth health and wellbeing. A powerful warning about the pitfalls of an over-emphasis on material wealth as a measure of progress was issued nearly half a century ago:

   <italic class="italic">“Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it tells us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.”</italic>.
