<p class="p">Man-made climate change is occurring, it is a major challenge for the 21st century, and it is already affecting the health and wellbeing of populations. Any scientific evidence, particularly for something as complicated as the response of the planet and all its systems, can never perfectly predict trends nor tell us precisely what to do. In public health, we face this all the time: the human body is also a very complex organism with huge variability in both genetic influences and environmental exposures from conception and over the lifespan. We make public health policy which often targets large numbers of people based on imperfect science, but of course we continue to monitor and research the problems and adapt policies and practices as new evidence becomes available.</p>
