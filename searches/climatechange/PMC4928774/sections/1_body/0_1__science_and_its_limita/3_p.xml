<p class="p">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has recently released its predictions for the world economy to 2060 [
 <xref rid="B9-children-02-00412" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In summary these are that growth will slow to around two thirds its current rate, that inequality will increase massively and that there is a big risk that climate change will make things worse. To quote Paul Mason (Guardian Weekly 18–24 July 2014) 
 <italic class="italic">“The whole projection is overlaid by the risk that the economic effects of climate change begin to destroy capital, coastal land and agriculture in the first half of the century, shaving up to 2.5% off world GDP (gross domestic product) and 6% in southeast Asia”.</italic> The message from the OECD is important for rich countries—the best of capitalism is now over. We would like to suggest that climate change is but one outcome of a series of serious and wicked problems that are in major part due to rampant capitalism. This commentary will describe how an epidemiologist interested in child health approaches the wicked problems affecting our society, touch on the known likely effects of the wicked problem of climate change on children’s health and then illustrate the negative effects of a world that focuses excessively on wealth creation. Maybe the behaviour changes required to reduce the impact of climate change can also create a more civil society.
