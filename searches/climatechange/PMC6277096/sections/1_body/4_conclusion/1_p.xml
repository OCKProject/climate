<p class="p">The NMFS methodology presented a step by step useful guideline for the assessment. Expertâ€™s knowledge synthesized through systematic indicator scoring facilitated through an online questionnaire survey presented a unique mechanism to characterize the vulnerabilities of seven freshwater fish. Analysis of the results supported claims that native species were relatively more vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability ranks ranged from moderate to very high vulnerability. Several limitations were recognized in this study. This assessment could represent a first step effort to quantify the climate change vulnerability of freshwater fish in the province. Future assessments could produce more refined results by employing spatially explicit vulnerability assessments with species traits [

Ultimately, the quantified results presented by this study represents a relative measure of climate change vulnerability since the results lack the capacity to serve as an absolute measure of vulnerability. The scope of this assessment was limited to the impacts of temperature and precipitation as the climate factors. Future assessments should consider expanding this to include multiple climatic variables relevant to freshwater ecosystems as more robust climate models for the region emerges. In addition, out of the 27 freshwater fishes known to occur in the region, this assessment covered 7 species due to the availability of required data and expertise. Data synthesis on other species should be complete to allow for further assessments on all freshwater fish species not included in this study. However, from a planning and decision-making perspective, this study could be significant for conservation, to inform climate change adaptation planning, prioritizing monitoring and further research for freshwater fish. Since climate change would likely outpace the ability of some species to shift to suitable habitats and genetically evolve, the need for proactive management responses cannot be overemphasized. Adaptation management actions such as assisted translocation or migration, removal of non-climatic anthropogenic stressors, habitat connectivity restoration, and restoring riparian forests are some responses that can strategically target vulnerable species and habitats.
