<p class="p">The scatterplot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208182.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) demonstrates the potential climate impact for each species within each quadrant. A species with high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to withstand changes fall within the high climate impact/vulnerability. Species likely to experience higher climate impacts are located on the upper quadrant and vice versa while species occupying the right side displays limited adaptability and vice versa. The most vulnerable species can be viewed at the uppermost right quadrant and vice versa.
