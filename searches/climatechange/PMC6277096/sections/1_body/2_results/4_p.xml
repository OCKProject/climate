 <xref rid="pone.0208182.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> highlights the analysis of mean expert’s confidence scores across the selected species. From this, it is observed that on average, expert’s confidence ratings were moderate for exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and vulnerability across all species. The individual expert’s confidence scores across all indicators were analyzed to ascertain if there was agreement in these ratings across all species. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed and the result showed no statistically significant difference among expert’s confidence ratings towards all the selected species (p = 0.75).
