<p class="p">Eleven experts (42%) from a limited pool of 26 experts answered the assessment survey. Of those returned surveys 73% (n = 8) had all sections completed. Two rounds of email reminders were sent to participants who had not responded to the survey i.e. corresponding to 58% of the total participants and those with incomplete surveys to increase the response rates. Bearing little result, the research team felt that the final number of respondents represented an acceptable proportion of the identified pool of experts and thus decisively used only completed surveys for this analysis. In total this corresponded to 31% of identified experts. The justification for this decision was that similar surveys with limited pools of expertise had been used to make sound and useful judgement to conservation planning [

All participants in this study were selected from a limited available pool of experts in freshwater fish ecology and management in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Also, considering the geographic scope and a limited number of species the response rate is acceptable for this study.
