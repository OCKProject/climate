<p class="p">Exposure index scores ranged from moderate to very high indicating the magnitude of projected changes in water temperature, precipitation and anthropogenic impacts to the fish’s distribution and spatial range. The lowest exposure was predicted for Northern Pike while the highest exposure was predicted for Atlantic salmon. The sensitivity index for the species showed moderate or high sensitivity to projected changes in climatic and non-climatic factors. Atlantic Salmon and Arctic Char showed the highest sensitivity to these changes. Adaptive capacity ranged from low to moderate. None of the target species were predicted to exhibit high adaptability to projected changes. Lake Trout and Northern Pike were rated low in their adaptability to future changes. In terms of the overall climate change vulnerability, four species were ranked moderately vulnerable, two species highly vulnerable and one species high—very highly vulnerable (at a transition point) to future changes (

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Comparing the expert's scores among native and non-native species showed that native species have a relatively higher vulnerability to climate change than non-native species. This points to the possibility that by mid-century, climatic conditions may favour non-native or other exotic species than native or endemic species. A Mann-Whitney u rank sum test of the expert scores showed a statistically significant difference between native and non- native fishes (p = 0.003) suggesting experts expect higher vulnerability for native species compared to non-native species in the region.
