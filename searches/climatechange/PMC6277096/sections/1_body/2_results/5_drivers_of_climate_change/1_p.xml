<p class="p">To ascertain which factors were likely to contribute the most to the final climate change vulnerability in the region, the mean experts score for all indicators across the species was calculated. Indicators having higher scores represent those factors that would strongly influence climate change vulnerability in the region. Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s004" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref> shows the extent to which all indicators influence the overall vulnerability while Figure A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s004" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref> provides a comparison across all indicators. From the analysis, it is observed that inherent resilience, dispersive capability, dependence on environment cues impacted by climate change, exposure to temperatures and genetic plasticity constitute the major drivers of freshwater fish species vulnerability in the region. On the other hand, it can be observed that species vulnerability is driven by different contributing factors. For instance, Figure B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s004" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref> indicates that Lake Trout’s relative vulnerability (high–very high), is majorly influenced by a combination of 7 factors, while Rainbow Trout’s relative vulnerability (moderate) is mostly influenced by 6 factors. Figure B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s004" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref> provides further information for all assessed species.
