<p class="p">To identify the non-climatic factors that will interact with climatic changes to drive species vulnerability, the section of the survey which asked experts to indicate the likely non-climatic threats to each species was analyzed and categorized into 6 sub-headings (
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In total, 128 responses were generated by all experts for all the species assessed. These responses suggest that habitat degradation/loss is the most threatening non-climatic factor to a freshwater fish vulnerability in Newfoundland and Labrador. For Lake Trout and Northern Pike, 50% of expert responses i.e. 7 out of 14 responses for both species were related to habitat loss and degradation. Over-exploitation was another critically important non-climatic threat indicated by the expertsâ€™ responses.
