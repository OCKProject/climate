<p class="p">The climatic projections for Newfoundland and Labrador based on the average output of seven regional climate changes models (RCM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] predicts a mean daily air temperature increase of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius in Newfoundland and 3 to 4 degrees Celsius in Labrador. Temperature shifts are predicted to be the greatest in winter and smaller in summer and autumn with increasing variations moving north toward Labrador. Mean daily precipitation is predicted to increase in all locations, with modest surges during the winter and spring with much smaller variation during summer [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Furthermore, increased intensity of precipitation is predicted for several regions with most events favouring rain over snow. To date, there have been no efforts to consider how these changes will affect freshwater fishes in the region. Studies conducted for other temperate regions in Canada have provided some useful insights on the impacts of warming on freshwater fishes in inland lakes and streams of boreal shield ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For example, the elevated surface water temperature of shallow lakes [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], has been linked to a reduction in the availability of habitats and fragmented distributions of some cold-water fish species [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Elevated temperature has also been linked to increased stream flow, less ice cover during winter, drier summers with higher evaporation rates, and the potential for the transformation of suitable conditions to favour some cool and warm-water fishes [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In summary, some fishes could experience net benefits and others net losses due to climate change. Despite lessons from such studies, the question remains if the projections for Newfoundland and Labrador will result in negative or positive impacts to its freshwater fish species. Coupled with this concern is the uncertainties that exist in climate models, and from a decision-making perspective, the need to plan in case future events mirror current predictions. Understanding and evaluating vulnerability can be useful in this situation to inform adaptation management actions while acknowledging uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore, there is the need to profile the vulnerability of freshwater fishes in Newfoundland and Labrador to climate change.
