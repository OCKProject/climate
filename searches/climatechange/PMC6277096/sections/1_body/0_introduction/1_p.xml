<p class="p">The unprecedented rate and magnitude of climate change present a threat to global freshwater fish populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In temperate regions, the impacts to freshwater ecosystems will arise through elevated water temperatures, alterations in precipitation regimes, flow rates, onset and duration of ice cover, the frequency of disturbances such as wildfires, floods and insect infestations [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Since freshwater fishes are ectotherms, exposure to temperature-related stress can elevate physiological stress and increased metabolic demands, which directly affect growth, survival, reproduction and productivity [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In addition, temporal and spatial changes to precipitation will alter seasonal flow patterns having negative effects on critical life stages, phenology, population dynamics, and reproductive success [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Climate change can also alter the biotic components of freshwater ecosystems causing indirect impacts on freshwater fish populations. Impacts can be caused by increasing invasive species population size and distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], changes in competition and predation rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In some cases, freshwater fishes have responded to impacts through evolutionary change, spatial distributional shifts, alterations in demographic processes, or through changing the timing of seasonal migration and spawning [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The compound effect of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors have compromised the ability of fishes to cope with or respond to these changes at a pace that matches environmental changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Species are vulnerable when they possess only limited ability to adapt or respond to rapid rates of future climate change. These species face a greater risk of extinction or extirpation and are usually the focus of adaptation efforts [
