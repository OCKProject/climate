<p class="p">Climate change may outpace the ability of some species to shift to suitable habitats and genetically evolve hence the need for proactive management responses cannot be overemphasized. Conservation management in Newfoundland and Labrador would be improved by reinforcing existing practices with adaptation management approaches [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Adaptation planning and implementation frameworks links known climate change vulnerability drivers with specific conservation management objectives [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. For instance, species predicted to be highly sensitive to temperature changes, could benefit from management actions implemented at restoring riparian forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], thus enhancing the resilience of the target species to climate change. In instances where species have limited dispersal ability to migrate or colonize suitable habitats or in situations where such an opportunity has been truncated by anthropogenic activities, management efforts could aim at addressing these challenges [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Adaptation strategy could focus on enhancing the natural evolutionary responses or adaptive capacity of vulnerable species to environmental changes through conservation activities like assisted migration, translocation or enhancing habitat connectivity.
