<p class="p">From the analyses presented in this paper, climate change vulnerability ranked from moderate to highâ€”very high vulnerability; no species was ranked low in climate change vulnerability. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s003" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> discusses the driving factors of each species vulnerability. Considering that this assessment did not include all freshwater fish species recorded in the province, it is indeterminate if similar results will occur on a broad scale assessment for the region. Notwithstanding, this result is in line with findings from studies conducted in other temperate latitude regions which suggest that native species are more vulnerable to climate change and non-native species especially warm or cool water fish species may likely expand their northward range [
