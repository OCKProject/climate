<p class="p">Globally, climate change stressors are increasing the vulnerability of freshwater fishes. Native species are at the higher end of this vulnerability due to their dependence on cold, clean water [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. There is evidence that several species in Canada are already experiencing the negative impacts of climate change which would likely continue in the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Recent reports from the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) also confirm that the impacts of multi-faceted threats (including climate change) are driving the declining populations of some freshwater fishes [
