 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] was adapted for the purposes of this study. The modified NMFS framework possessed three phases: a scoping phase, an assessment phase and an analysis phase. The scoping phase comprised of activities that shaped the boundary and objectives of the research. The steps in this phase included: determining the spatial and temporal scale of the assessment, selecting the target species, identifying relevant climatic factors, selecting appropriate sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators relevant to the study objective and finally, identifying and selecting appropriate individuals with expertise in the subject area. The assessment phase represents the actual process of evaluating the vulnerability of the species. It involved the following activities: designing the online questionnaire survey and conducting the expert elicitation process. During the analysis phase, data are collated, analyzed and visualized; this includes collating experts scores, conducting a quantitative data analysis of the scores, and determining the overall vulnerability of the species.
