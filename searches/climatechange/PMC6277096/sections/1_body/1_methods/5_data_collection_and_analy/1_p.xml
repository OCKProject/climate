<p class="p">An online questionnaire was developed and employed to facilitate data collection. Participants accessed the online questionnaire through Survey monkey (an online survey tool). The questionnaire was designed into five sections consisting of twelve survey questions each relating to a vulnerability indicator. In the first section of the survey, experts assessed the exposure to projected changes in water temperature and precipitation (stream flow change) for each freshwater fish. The expert assessment was aided by climate change projections provided in [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In addition, the Nature Conservancyâ€™s climate wizard tool was provided as a link in the questionnaire to supplement expert knowledge. This tool provides spatially explicit visual maps of the study area using an ensemble of statistically downscaled Global circulation models (to a 0.5-degree grid) to project average annual temperature and precipitation changes by mid-21st century [

The fourth section assessed the cumulative effects of non-climatic stressors for each species distribution range. The final section required participants to indicate other threats or species-specific vulnerability factors not included in the survey.
