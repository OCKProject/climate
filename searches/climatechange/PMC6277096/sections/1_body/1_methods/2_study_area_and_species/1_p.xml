 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In addition, 5 non-native salmonid species were introduced in the 1880s in response to fishery policies advocating the stocking of exotic species [

 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Information on the distribution and life history variation of freshwater species in the province is limited. For the purposes of this study, vulnerability assessment was confined to those species that have well-documented information on species and population distribution, habitat requirements and life history variation combined with available scientific expertise. The target species that met these criteria include; Atlantic Salmon (
