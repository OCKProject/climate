The individuals consisted of freshwater fisheries scientists from government research agencies, conservation groups, and academia. Participants in the survey were chosen based on whether they had extensive research experience with freshwater fishes in the study area and that they possessed PhD or itâ€™s equivalent. All experts were assumed to have adequate technical knowledge of all selected species including their distribution, life history, population dynamics and status and major drivers of change and current and planned management regimes. It was also assumed that all experts could obtain new and existing information on all species with which to make sound judgments to assess the species. Lastly, experts were deemed to have the ability to articulate the justification for their assessments.</p>
