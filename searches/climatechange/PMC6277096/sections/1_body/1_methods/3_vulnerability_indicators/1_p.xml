<p class="p">Based on the IPCC’s definition [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], the climate change vulnerability of a species is characterized by three factors: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. In this study, exposure refers to the magnitude of climate change factors (temperature and precipitation) projected to impact freshwater habitats in the study area [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Projected changes in air temperature served as a proxy for changes in water temperature while projected changes in precipitation served as a proxy for stream flow since these factors correlate in freshwater ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Sensitivity to climate change refers to the degree of persistence displayed by a species in the presence of changing climate factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. It reflects the intrinsic ability to withstand changes in the environment; therefore, sensitive species will possess limited survivability to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Adaptive capacity points to the inherent ability to adapt or move to suitable habitats and is potentially determined by behavioural changes, dispersal ability, and genetic variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Sensitivity and adaptive capacity are based on freshwater fish’s intrinsic traits [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. A review of the published literature identified relevant life history and biological factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208182.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], nine of which formed the vulnerability indicators. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208182.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> provides a list of these indicators and its definition. Anthropogenic stressors were included as an element of the vulnerability indicators. Overall, 12 indicators were developed and used in this assessment.
