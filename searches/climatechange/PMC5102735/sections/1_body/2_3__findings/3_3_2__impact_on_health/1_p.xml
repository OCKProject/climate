<p class="p">The FGD explored information about recent environmental changes due to climate change and the disaster impact on the health of the coastal population. Specifically, the main aim was to get information from the participants about the impact on health (such as general health situation, mental health, and wounds) during Sidr and Aila and after Sidr and Aila. In order to understand the magnitude of the problem, information on the health condition of people in the community before the natural disaster was also gathered. Changes observed and experienced by people in relation to climate change were also expressed by respondents.</p>
