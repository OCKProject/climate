<p class="p">The third theme explored the most vulnerable population from the climate induced natural disasters. The analysis concludes that women, elderly people, and children are the most vulnerable groups of people in the community. The kind of clothing women wear causes a major obstruction in their mobility and quick recovery during an emergency situation becomes hard for the vulnerable women. These findings are similar to those in research carried out by Mehta [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Climate change affects both men and women; however, the impact is felt more by women. Climate change increases the females' burden of meeting their household responsibilities. During cyclones, children and women are more vulnerable because of their physical formation. Most of the females have a low level of education. Women may have been more at risk because they stayed behind to save or search for their children, while others escaped. Results from this research resonate with other research studies by Adebo and Sekumade [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], Adeniyi et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and Guha-Sapir et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Children and the elderly were found most vulnerable during the cyclone. They are vulnerable due to health and physical vulnerabilities and because of their inability to run fast. Children are also suffering from health problems such as malnutrition. These results are similar to other studies by Devkota et al. [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], Kendrovski and Spasenovska [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], Davies et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and Bhuiyan and Khan [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>].
