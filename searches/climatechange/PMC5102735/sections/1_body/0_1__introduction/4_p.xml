<p class="p">The climatic conditions of Bangladesh are influenced by a number of global and regional scale factors. These factors include geographical location, the effect of North-South continental scale atmospheric pressure gradient (terrestrial to oceanic), the influence of the jet stream stretched from South East Asia to Northern Africa on the monsoon wind system, changes in the solar albedo due to land use, land cover change in the region and its impacts on wind pattern, and fluctuations in the terrestrial and sea surface temperature [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Bangladesh is already evidencing the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change. The following impacts have been observed: hotter summers, irregular monsoons, untimely rainfall, heavy rainfall over short periods (causing water logging and landslides), very little rainfall in dry periods, increased river flow and inundation during monsoon, increased frequency, intensity, and recurrence of floods, crop damage due to flash floods and monsoonal rain, crop failure due to drought, prolonged cold spells, salinity intrusion along the coast (leading to scarcity of potable water and redundancy of prevailing crop practices), coastal erosion, river bank erosion, deaths due to extreme heat and cold, increasing mortality and morbidity, and prevalence and outbreak of dengue, malaria, and diarrhoea [
