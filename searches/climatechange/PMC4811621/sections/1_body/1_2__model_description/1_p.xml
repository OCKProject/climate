<p class="p">A deterministic transmission model is developed as a framework for understanding the impact of temperature and rainfall on malaria dynamics. The human population is subdivided into four classes: susceptible (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>)), exposed or incubating (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>)), infectious (
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>)), and recovered individuals who become partially immune (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>)), with 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> accounting for time in days. Individuals are recruited into the susceptible class at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> and individuals die naturally at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>. The rate of infection of a susceptible individual is dependent on the mosquito's biting rate 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>) and the proportion of bites by infectious mosquitoes on susceptible humans that produce infection 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>. 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> account for temperature and rainfall dependence, respectively. Once individuals are infected, they do not automatically become infectious as they do not have gametocytes, but they enter the exposed class 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub>, where parasites in their bodies are still in the asexual stages. Exposed humans then progress at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 </sub> to the infectious class, in which they now have gametocytes in their bloodstream making them capable of infecting the susceptible anopheles mosquitoes. Individuals recover through treatment at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, where a proportion (1 − 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>) recovers with temporary immunity and the compliment 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> recovers with no temporary immunity. Temporarily immune individuals lose immunity at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>. Infected individuals who do not seek treatment die from infection at a rate 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic>. Both human and mosquito infections take time to develop into an infectious state. Within host parasite dynamics are weather independent, but within vector parasite dynamics as well as the mosquito life cycle are weather dependent.
