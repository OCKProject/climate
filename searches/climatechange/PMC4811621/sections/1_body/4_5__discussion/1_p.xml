<p class="p">A model incorporating rainfall and temperature is analysed regarding malaria transmission. Results from the model suggest that the optimum temperature window for peak falciparum malaria transmission is 30–32°C. This is in agreement with other studies [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Furthermore, results from model analysis suggest that daily rainfall in the range of 15–17 mm is ideal for the spread of malaria. Perhaps the most interesting but unexpected result is that by 2040 malaria is projected to die out on the southern fringe of the disease in Africa. The fact that the same result was detected using projections from two different GCM models makes this a key result. A drying trend is the likely driving force for this change [
