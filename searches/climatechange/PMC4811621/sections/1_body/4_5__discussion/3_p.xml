<p class="p">The model has the following limitations: (i) it did not consider the role of human migration neither did it consider other climate variables in particular relative humidity as the tropical anopheline mosquitoes prefer humidities above 60% [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]; (ii) it did not consider the role of socioeconomic factors in malaria transmission dynamics but it would be interesting to incorporate these factors to ascertain whether climate change in combination with these factors will amplify malaria transmission in the highlands. Despite these limitations, the model is reasonable enough to be able to give a realistic picture of malaria in the African continent. Thus, results from the study will be useful at various levels of decision making, for example, in setting up an early warning and sustainable strategies for climate change and adaptation for malaria vectors control programmes in Africa. These results can be generalized to other tropical regions outside Africa.
