<p class="p">This study seeks to build a mathematical model in conjunction with the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) that will enable prediction and mapping of the current and potential future distribution of malaria in Africa as a result of climate change. The study will highlight how combining regional climate models with mathematical models of malaria transmission provides valuable tools for better understanding of future disease scenarios as climatic conditions change. We modify our previous work [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] to incorporate rainfall into the model. We focus on the construction of a realistic, climate-based malaria transmission model that captures the combined effects of both rainfall and temperature on malaria infection dynamics. This approach permits us to gain insight into the effect of climate change on malaria transmission. However, to reduce the complexity of the model genetic variation in vector competences is not explored in the same way as rainfall is not partitioned into runoff and infiltration in this paper.
