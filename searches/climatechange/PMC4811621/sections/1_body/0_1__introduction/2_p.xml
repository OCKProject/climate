<p class="p">Malaria is sensitive to climate change in the sense that the vector that spreads malaria and the parasite that causes the disease are sensitive to climate variables especially rainfall and temperature. Research on the impact of climate change on the dynamics of malaria is still ongoing [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, most studies tend to consider the effect of temperature alone on the dynamics of malaria, neglecting the impact of incorporating rainfall in the mathematical models of malaria transmission. Understanding the role of temperature and rainfall in malaria transmission is of particular importance in light of climate change as changes can alter vector development rates, shift vector geographical distribution, and alter transmission dynamics. Climate change is widely expected to significantly affect the global spread, intensity, and distribution of malaria. The question is, how is climate change going to affect the gains made thus far in trying to reduce the burden of malaria? That is a question which was once answered by Tanser et al. [
