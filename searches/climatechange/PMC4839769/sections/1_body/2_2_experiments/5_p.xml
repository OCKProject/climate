<p class="p">The expansion of croplands in the model follows a hierarchy where grasslands are converted to crops, before shrubs and trees. The result is that eligible grid cells that contain grasslands and shrubs prior to deforestation have these fractions converted to crops as well at the start of 2011. It should be noted that in TRIFFID crops and grasslands have identical biogeochemical and biogeophysical characteristics. The only difference is that grasslands can be outcompeted by other plant functional types while the crop distribution is prescribed. This means that all areas converted to crops in 2011 remain as such until the end of the experiments.</p>
