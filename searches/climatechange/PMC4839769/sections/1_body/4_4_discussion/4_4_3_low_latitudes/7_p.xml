<p class="p">Local soil warming occurs due to the same energy balance modifications seen in the mid latitudes, with higher temperatures related to a decrease in outgoing sensible heat flux that overcomes the increase in outgoing net radiative and latent heat fluxes (

The higher local soil temperature anomalies present in the low latitudes, occur due to the larger reductions in outgoing sensible heat, as well as increased rates of change in the energy budget of the soils, than what is seen in the mid latitudes (Figs
