<p class="p">The increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and warmer temperatures seen in our low latitude simulations, are climatic effects more often associated with modelled deforestation. Even then, due mostly to the soil carbon response, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature increases are not proportional to deforested area. Seeing as how the location and scale of deforestation can lead to either an increase or decrease to local and global soil carbon, our results call attention to the subtleties of this response and toward a need for a better understanding the complexity of soil carbon dynamics [
