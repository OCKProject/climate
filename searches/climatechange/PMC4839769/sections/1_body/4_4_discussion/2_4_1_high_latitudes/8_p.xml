<p class="p">The reduction in soil moisture, while less important in explaining the initial accumulation of soil carbon, is likely exerting a larger influence after about 2060, when soil carbon continues to increase (albeit at slower rates) in spite of increasing soil temperature over deforested areas (Figs

The increased moisture is likely due to the larger area used for 100% deforestation, with more snow covered areas and more cooling resulting in less ET. This result can also be observed in (
