<p class="p">In a managed forest, clear cutting has been shown to reduce soil carbon [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. At particular temperate zone sites conversion of forests to cropland resulted in about a 32% ±20% decrease in soil carbon and the conversion of grassland to forest caused soil carbon
