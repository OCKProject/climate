<p class="p">With the exception of the 100% simulations, all deforestation scenarios, regardless of location, experience further loss of forests after the initial disturbance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). In all experiments, the fraction of forest loss of the 25%-75% simulations tends to converge to around 50% in the high latitudes, 70% in the mid latitudes and 80% in the low latitudes. The 5% and 15% scenarios, continue to loose forests up to the end of the simulations. Pre-deforestation forest cover is identical for all experiments. The initial and continued forest loss percentages are based on this original, pre-deforestation value.
