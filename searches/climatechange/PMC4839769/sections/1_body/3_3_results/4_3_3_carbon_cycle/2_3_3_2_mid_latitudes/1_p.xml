 <sub class="sub">2</sub> values. After this initial pulse, the behaviour of the simulations differs. The 5%-25% scenarios show increases relative to the initial post pulse value up to year 2100. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations remain near the post-pulse value for 45% experiment while the 75% and 100% scenarios, in similar fashion to the high latitude case, exhibit continuos reductions in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> after the initial peak. Contrary to the high latitudes simulations these reductions in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are not large enough to generate negative anomalies by the end of the century.
