<p class="p">After the initial disturbance the remaining forest cover is free to change according to the vegetation modelâ€™s response to climate. In presenting and discussing our results, experiments are classified according to their initial arbitrary deforestation fraction. For example, the 5% experiment refers to the simulation in which 5% of the forest cover was removed instantaneously at the start of 2011. Average SAT, soil temperature and P-E values for the 2090-2100 decade and their 95% confidence intervals are presented in Tables
