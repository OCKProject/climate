<p class="p">The global moisture response over land over the low latitudes is less consistent between simulations than that of the high and mid latitude simulations, with most deforestation fractions changing between drier and wetter conditions during the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" class="xref">Fig 12</xref>). In all experiments, conditions become drier over deforested bins and the P-E anomalies over these areas are an order of magnitude larger than those registered in the global response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" class="xref">Fig 12</xref>). Both ET and precipitation increase over deforested bins and drying occurs because the increase in ET overtakes the increase in precipitation. It is interesting to note that the local drying is usually more intense in the mid latitudes than in the low latitude simulations (
