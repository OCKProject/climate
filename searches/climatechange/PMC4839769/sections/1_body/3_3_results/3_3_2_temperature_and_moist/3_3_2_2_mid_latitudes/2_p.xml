<p class="p">The globally averaged time series of soil temperature response shows a similar pattern to the SATs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). In all simulations, average local soil temperatures over deforested bins are warmer than those of the control, with cooling occurring outside of the deforested areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). The initial local soil temperature response is proportional to the amount of deforestation. In most cases positive anomalies continue to increase, the exceptions being the 75% and 100% simulations which, due to reduced rates of energy absorption, resulting from increased albedo and outgoing latent heat flux, have a decreasing trend following deforestation.
