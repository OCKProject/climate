<p class="p">For all simulations deforestation causes a reduction in global SAT, with the cooling being proportional to deforested percentage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The reduction in temperature is magnified at higher latitudes due to an increase in snow and ice cover and consequent increase in albedo. In the 100% scenario the average temperature change from 20°N to 40°N was -0.42K and the temperature change from 40°N and above was -0.78K. Lower atmospheric CO

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>—The term local refers to area weighted averages over the initially deforested grid cells), however soil temperatures become warmer in areas with large forest cover prior to deforestation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). This warming is due to, similarly to what is observed more commonly in the mid- and low-latitude experiments, a decrease in sensible heat flux following deforestation. Soil temperatures show a similar trend to the SAT response
