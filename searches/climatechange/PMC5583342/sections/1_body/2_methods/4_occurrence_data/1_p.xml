<p id="Par18" class="p">For the first five periods (covering 10000 BCE – 1800 CE) we compiled spatially explicit detection histories of the brown bear across Europe using a database containing published and unpublished archeofaunal records from dated archaeological and paleontological excavation sites

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 76), moors and riverbeds (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 11), as well as 272 sites without known designation. For each record, we extracted data on the presence and abundance of subfossil bone remains of brown bear, red deer (
 <italic class="italic">Cervus elaphus</italic>), and roe deer (
 <italic class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</italic>) (total abundance, median: 7, range: 1–26,428). Records containing red or roe deer, but not brown bear, served as negative controls, because both deer species were typical elements of the European fauna during the Holocene and the most frequent prey of European Stone Age hunters

 </sup>. The rationale behind this approach is that if remains of red or roe deer were present at a given site, it was suitable for preservation of bone material and, thus, for detection of brown bears, if the species had been present. This allowed us to account for imperfect detection in the archaeofaunal record, while simultaneously modelling the spatiotemporal variation in brown bear extinction and colonization rates across the European continent. In total, our dataset comprised 4,177 archeofaunal records from 3,461 excavation sites (records from archaeological layers with distinct temporal context were treated separately). We used the above records of brown bear 
 <italic class="italic">presence</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">absence</italic> in each cell and period to obtain detection/non-detection data (i.e., detection histories) for the first five periods (i.e., 10000 BCE – 1800 CE). To inform the model about the distribution of the brown bear in the last two periods, we used recent occurrence data from Chapron
