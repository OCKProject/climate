<p id="Par15" class="p">We fitted a generalized linear mixed effects model to analyse variation in reproductive rate using a 
 <italic class="italic">gamma</italic> distribution with an 
 <italic class="italic">identity</italic>-link function. In this model, we included a random effect for continent (North America, Europe and Asia) to account for differences in the phylogeographic histories of brown bear populations across continents

 </sub> into the model to test the hypothesis that energy availability during the growing season and energy expenditure during the wintering season constrain the reproductive rate of the brown bear. As the sample size varied among the study populations, we performed the analysis with and without weighting of the observations by their sample size. We calculated the weight of observations as

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>

  <italic class="italic">LI</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>

  <italic class="italic">LS</italic>
 </sub> were the sample sizes for female body mass, inter-birth interval and litter size, respectively. In the case of observations with missing information about sample size, we assumed a sample size of one. Weighted and non-weighted analyses led to identical conclusions. In the main text we report results of the weighted analysis, because it incorporates variability in uncertainty in the estimates of life-history traits among populations. We assessed whether the analysis was affected by collinearity among predictors, by calculating variance inflation factors and by using alternative variables to characterize the growing season and found the results of our analysis to be robust (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table
