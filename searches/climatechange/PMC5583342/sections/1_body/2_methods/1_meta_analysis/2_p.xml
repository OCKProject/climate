<p id="Par12" class="p">We used a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that energy availability during the growing season and energy expenditure during the wintering season impose a life-history trade-off on the reproductive rate of the brown bear (
 <italic class="italic">Ursus arctos</italic>). To do so, we compiled information on litter size (
 <italic class="italic">LS</italic>, mean number of cubs per litter), inter-birth interval (
 <italic class="italic">LI</italic>, mean number of years between litters), and female body mass (
 <italic class="italic">FM</italic>, kg) for 43 brown bear populations from North America (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 33), Europe (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) and Asia (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) from 25 published studies (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). We excluded five populations where data was not available for all variables from the analysis. Based on the reported litter sizes and inter-birth intervals, we calculated the reproductive rate as 
 <italic class="italic">RR</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">LS</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">LI</italic> (cubs per female per year) for each of the remaining 38 populations.
