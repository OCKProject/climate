 </sup>. These data represent spatially explicit reconstructions of fractional land use covering the period 10000 BCE to 2000 CE. The data have a spatial resolution of 5′ × 5′ and a temporal resolution of 1,000-year time intervals for the BCE period, then 100-year time intervals until 1700 CE, and 10-year time intervals until 2000 CE. For analysis, we extracted three variables reflecting human impact on the environment, namely the proportion of a given cell covered by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas. We used the sum of these variables as a proxy for human land use, that is, the total fraction of land appropriated by humans. Then we averaged the fractional land use for each cell across the time intervals that fell in each of the seven periods used for the metapopulation model. The time intervals that occurred at the margins of the periods received only half the weight in the calculations compared to those time intervals in the core of the periods. We resampled the land-use data to the 100-km grid for analysis. To account for uncertainties due to different assumptions about historical changes in land-use intensification (i.e., per capita land-use intensity)
