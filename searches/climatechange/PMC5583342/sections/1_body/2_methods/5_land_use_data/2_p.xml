<p id="Par20" class="p">We decided to use land use as a proxy for human impact, because unlike other measures, such as human population density, land use integrates the various effects of humans on brown bear populations. First, previous work has shown that habitat loss due to land use severely constrains the occurrence and breeding range of the European brown bear

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup>. Second, the potential for human-bear conflicts due to predation on livestock or wild ungulates increases in intensively used landscapes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, land-use intensification historically coincided with the persecution and local extirpation of the brown bear and other large carnivores in Europe
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>. This is why persecution and habitat loss are generally the most important drivers of extinction risk in mammals, and particularly in large carnivores
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>. While the behaviour of humans in relation to bears might well have changed through time, there is evidence that humans have hunted bears since at least 9000 BP
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>
 </sup> and that bear hunting and the associated rituals and beliefs were deeply rooted in the prehistoric culture of humans in the northern hemisphere
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, we expect land use to be a reliable proxy of the combined effects of hunting, persecution and human-induced habitat loss.
