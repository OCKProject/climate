<p id="Par37" class="p">We ran 10 parallel chains for each model. The initial values for the chains were drawn randomly from uniform distributions. The models were run for 4,500 iterations with an adaptive burn-in phase of 2,000 iterations and a thinning interval of 25 iterations, resulting in 100 samples per chain, corresponding to 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution. The chains were checked for convergence, temporal autocorrelation, and effective sample size using the
