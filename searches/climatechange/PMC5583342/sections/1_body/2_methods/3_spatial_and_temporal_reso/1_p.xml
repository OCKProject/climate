<p id="Par17" class="p">For our analysis, we defined seven periods: (1) 10000–7000 BCE, (2) 7000–3000 BCE, (3) 3000 BCE – 0 CE, (4) 0–1500 CE, (5) 1500–1800 CE, (6) 1950–1970 CE, and (7) 2010–2015 CE. We used the midpoint of each of the seven periods to determine the length of the time intervals Δ
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> between the respective periods in the metapopulation model (e.g., Δ
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> = 8500–5000 = 3500 years). The time intervals Δ
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> between periods were 3500, 3500, 2250, 900, 310, and 52.5 years, respectively. Moreover, we used a 100 × 100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> grid (100-km grid, hereafter) including 789 terrestrial cells across Europe for the analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). By using a coarse grain of 100 km in our analysis, we minimized the problem of missing data in the archeofaunal occurrence records and avoided inflating data quality due to inappropriate downscaling of reconstructed past land use and climate data
