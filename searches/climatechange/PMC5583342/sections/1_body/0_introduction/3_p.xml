 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>, they face a trade-off between overwinter survival and reproduction. The allocation of energy to either depends primarily on the energy reserves at the onset of hibernation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup> and on the energy required to survive the winter. Paradoxically, bioenergetic models predict that energy demands of hibernating mammals increase during warm winters, because the energetic costs of torpor increase
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. This means that less energy can be allocated to reproduction during warm winters (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). To compensate for this loss of reproductive potential, brown bears must increase energy uptake during the growing season, when they feed extensively on plant material (e.g., berries and seeds) to build up body fat before den entry

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, net primary productivity and winter temperature should impose a strong life-history trade-off for the reproductive rate of the brown bear, which could have directly affected the population dynamics of the species during the warming period after the Late Glacial.
