<p id="Par7" class="p">We combined the metapopulation model with a path analysis to disentangle the potential direct and indirect causal effects of winter temperature, net primary productivity and human land use on the extinction rate of the brown bear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). We further included elevation into the path analysis to assure that the effects of the other three variables were not simply an artefact caused by the role of montane habitats as refugia

 </sup>. We used a Bayesian variable selection procedure to select the pathways that best explained the relationships among variables. Of 1,024 possible models (all combinations of 10 paths), 16 were selected at least once during the Markov Chain Monte Carlo search (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). All of the selected models indicated that increasing land use and winter temperature were the principal drivers of extinction, with humans partially mediating the effect of winter temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This suggests that increasing winter temperatures facilitated human land use in regions with formerly unsuitable climates
