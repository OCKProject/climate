<p id="Par5" class="p">To test this hypothesis, we first compiled data about the life histories of female brown bears from 38 populations across the species’ entire geographic range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). We found that reproductive rate increases with net primary productivity, but decreases with increasing winter temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b,c</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This suggests that, due to the trade-off between overwinter survival and reproduction, changes in net primary productivity and winter temperature during the Holocene directly affected the population dynamics of the brown bear by reducing the species’ reproductive rate.
