<p id="Par8" class="p">Most strikingly, the increase in winter temperature also increased the extinction rate directly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), which is in line with the predicted negative relationship between winter temperature and the reproductive rate of the brown bear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). As expected, net primary productivity partly dampened the effect of winter temperature on the extinction rate by 26.5% (14.9–38.1%, 95% credible interval, CI hereafter). Increasing net primary productivity associated with rising temperatures after the Late Glacial may, thus, have facilitated the persistence and expansion of the brown bear in some regions. Yet, warming in Europe during the Mid-Holocene was greater in winter than in summer, with a 2 to 4 °C increase in most parts of Europe over the last 12,000 years

 </sup>. This discrepancy between summer and winter warming might have limited the adaptation of the species to suboptimal wintering conditions. After accounting for the dampening effect of net primary productivity, the remaining direct effect of winter temperature (0.94, 0.77–1.1; mean, 95% CI) was of the same magnitude as the direct effect of human land use (0.79, 0.60–0.99; mean, 95% CI). Importantly, these estimates incorporate uncertainty in model assumptions about changes in per capita land use through time and about colonization of the European continent by the brown bear from Asia, respectively (see Supplementary Methods). Thus, even after accounting for these potential biases, our results still suggest that increasing winter temperatures contributed substantially to the Holocene decline of the brown bear in Europe.
