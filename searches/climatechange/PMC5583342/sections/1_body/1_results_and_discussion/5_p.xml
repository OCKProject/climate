<p id="Par9" class="p">The model predicts that the first local extinctions occurred in southwestern Europe during the Mid-Holocene warming period (ca. 7,000 to 5,000 years ago; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The rise of the Roman Empire, approximately 2,000 years ago, marked the onset of large-scale extinctions in southwestern Europe and on the British Isles, followed by further range loss in central Europe that ultimately led to today’s fragmented relic populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The spatiotemporal coincidence of increased extinction rate with the rise of the Roman Empire could stem from direct hunting or persecution to protect livestock

 </sup>. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of range contraction also reveals that local extinctions not only followed the increase in human land use, but also closely tracked the Holocene increase in winter temperatures across Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Explicitly considering the spatial information in the distribution of archaeofaunal and contemporary occurrence records allowed us to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on the decline of the brown bear. Therefore, and importantly, direct effects of climate on megafaunal extinctions may not be evident where information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of species occurrences is not available
