<p id="Par10" class="p">Our study yields perhaps the most comprehensive glimpse into the spatial and temporal patterns of a species’ extinction in the distant past. We demonstrate that considering spatiotemporal dynamics explicitly can provide unique and more detailed insights into the causes of prehistoric extinctions than purely chronological data. We conclude that, apart from human impacts, the direct interaction of changing climatic conditions with species’ life histories is a critical pathway to species extinctions, both in the past and today. Therefore, our analysis strongly suggests that, when climatic shifts coincided with human expansions, the mere dichotomy of ‘humans

 </sup>. More plausibly, complex direct and indirect effects of humans and changing environmental conditions caused the prehistoric megafaunal extinctions that demarcate the onset of the defaunation of Earth’s ecosystems.
