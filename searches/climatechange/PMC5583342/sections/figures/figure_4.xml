  <p class="p">Spatiotemporal trends of extinction and colonization rates and occurrence of the brown bear in Europe during the past 12,000 years. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), Maps showing (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) the net trend towards extinction (red) or colonization (blue) given as the logarithm of the ratio of extinction to colonization rates [log
   <sub class="sub">10</sub>(Ext. rate/Col. rate)], and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) the probability of brown bear occurrence (blue) in each period. Estimates of extinction and colonization rates and occurrence probability were obtained from a metapopulation model based on archaeofaunal and contemporary occurrence records for the brown bear. Uncertainty in model assumptions was incorporated by a two-factorial design with two scenarios for changes in per capita land-use intensity during the Holocene (constant 
   <italic class="italic">versus</italic> decreasing) and two scenarios for colonization of the European continent by the brown bear from Asia (yes 
   <italic class="italic">versus</italic> no), respectively (see Supplementary Methods). The maps in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) were created with the statistical programming language
