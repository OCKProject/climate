   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Path diagram and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), direct effects of land use (LU), winter temperature (WT), net primary productivity (NPP), and elevation (ELE) on the extinction rate of the brown bear, as well as indirect effects of the three environmental variables mediated by humans. In (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), paths that emerged from Bayesian variable selection with a probability &gt;95% are highlighted with an asterisk (Supplementary TableÂ 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Path widths are proportional to standardized effect sizes. In (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), the violins represent the density distributions of estimated direct and indirect effects for each explanatory variable. Note that positive effects (red paths) increase extinction rate, whereas negative effects (blue paths) decrease extinction rate. Uncertainty in model assumptions was incorporated by a two-factorial design with two scenarios for changes in per capita land-use intensity during the Holocene (constant 
   <italic class="italic">versus</italic> decreasing) and two scenarios for colonization of the European continent by the brown bear from Asia (yes 
   <italic class="italic">versus</italic> no), respectively (see Supplementary Methods).
