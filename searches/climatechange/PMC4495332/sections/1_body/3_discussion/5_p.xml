<p class="p">Although our level of statistical significance was articulated at the outset of the study (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.050), our logistic regression analysis found that the variable “Number of Years in Practice” approached statistical significance at 0.053. After holding all other variables constant, the odds of agreeing that climate change is an important issue negligibly declined with increasing number of years in practice. Further research is warranted to understand this trend. However, it is plausible that because climate change is a recently documented phenomenon, dietitians practicing longer may have spent less time being aware of climate change than more recently trained dietitians.
