<p class="p">Following this, we tested the hypothesis that the belief that animal products 
 <italic class="italic">are not essential for a healthy diet</italic> predicts the promotion of diet as a climate change mitigation strategy. The corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value (0.013) for the number and percentage of survey participants that engage in activities that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy based on the belief that animal products are not essential for a healthy diet is exceedingly small, indicating that the results are statistically significant. These data suggest that those who believe that animal products are not essential for a healthy diet are significantly more likely to engage in activities that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy than those who do believe that animal products are essential for a healthy diet.
