 <p class="p" xmlns="">After a household has been affected by a natural disaster, we conduct an assessment, which is a type of screening, to assess whether the household is destitute or not as a result of a natural disaster.</p>
 <p class="p" xmlns="">We are usually notified by the members of the community â€“ such as, counsellors, community development workers and even affected community members themselves.</p>
 <p class="p" xmlns="">Once damage that has been caused by a natural disaster has been confirmed, we recommend the provision of social relief of distress in the form of food parcels (containing basic food necessities), blankets and cash.</p>
 <p class="p" xmlns="">In extreme cases of damage, we place the people affected by the natural disaster in alternative accommodation such as churches and community halls. (Social workers, pers. comm., n.d.)</p>
