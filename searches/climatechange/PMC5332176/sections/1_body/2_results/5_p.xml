<p class="p">The sensitization rates presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> were converted into estimates of clinically relevant sensitization rates using data from 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burbach et al. (2009)</xref>. These results are presented in Table S4, indicating that compared with the population sensitized to ragweed, the population clinically sensitized to ragweed in Europe is approximately 25% lower for both the baseline and 2041â€“2060. Table S4 also shows that future changes in the European population base do not greatly affect our projections, but they suggest smaller impacts in countries with decreasing populations such as Germany, Poland, and Romania, and accentuated impacts in countries with increasing populations (e.g., France, the United Kingdom).
