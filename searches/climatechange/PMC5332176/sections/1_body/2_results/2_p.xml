<p class="p">Here, the two model suites are considered to be equally plausible because they both show a similar performance in simulating pollen amounts compared with limited available observations (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hamaoui-Laguel et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, the estimated population affected was averaged across the two model suites for all further analysis. However, in the numerical results, the data for both model suites are additionally reported in square brackets as an indicator of uncertainty; the following format is used: [CHIMERE, WRF/RegCM]. All subsequent results are presented for RCP4.5 (i.e., a moderate degree of climate change) for the sake of simplicity, bearing in mind that the numbers of sensitized individuals in the future are very similar between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
