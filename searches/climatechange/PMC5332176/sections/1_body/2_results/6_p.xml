<p class="p">To estimate the potential impacts of future climate-related changes on allergy symptoms for individuals sensitized to ragweed, maps of average total season pollen (mid-July–mid-October) subdivided into monthly periods were produced and are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. These estimates indicate that particularly across France and northwest Italy, airborne pollen is likely to be present much earlier in the season (mid-July–mid-August) because of accelerated plant development. In the peak pollen months (mid-August–mid-September), more ragweed pollen is likely to be present across Europe, with the greatest increases occurring away from current pollen hotspots. Our projections suggest that pollen will persist in the air across most of Europe in the mid-September to mid-October period, likely as a result of delayed frosts (
