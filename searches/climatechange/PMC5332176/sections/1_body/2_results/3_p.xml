<p class="p">Our best estimates of the current and future population sensitized to ragweed from the pollen RSR dose–response relationship shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The sensitized population numbers are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> at the country level and are summed for EU28 and non-EU28 countries and for Europe as a whole. Overall, our estimates indicate that under the RCP4.5 emissions scenario and the reference ragweed invasion scenario, the number of people sensitized to ragweed in Europe would increase from approximately 33 million (27 million and 38 million based on CHIMERE and WRF/RegCM, respectively) at baseline to 77 million (68 million and 86 million based on CHIMERE and WRF/RegCM, respectively) in 2041–2060 owing to higher pollen counts affecting a larger spatial area. Sensitization is projected to increase in countries with an existing ragweed problem, such as Romania and Italy, partly as a result of increased pollen production by established plant populations; however, the greatest proportional increases are likely to be in areas where ragweed sensitization is currently relatively uncommon, such as Germany, France, and Poland. By 2041–2060, sensitization to ragweed will be widespread across the whole of Europe except for Scandinavia, the Baltic States, most of Spain, Portugal, and Ireland.
