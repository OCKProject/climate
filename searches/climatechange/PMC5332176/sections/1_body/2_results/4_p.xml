 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> also examines the impact of ragweed invasion scenario upon sensitization rates. Under the reference plant invasion scenario, the population sensitized to ragweed at the European level is estimated to increase from 33 million (range: 27 million–38 million) to 77 million (range: 68 million–86 million) by 2041–2060. In comparison, a slow plant invasion scenario reduces the projected future value to approximately 52 million (range: 44 million–59 million), whereas a rapid plant invasion scenario increases the projected value to approximately 107 million (range: 98 million–117 million).
