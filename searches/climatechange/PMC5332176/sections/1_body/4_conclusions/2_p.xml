<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first study to model the future impacts of climate change on plant distribution, plant life cycles, and pollen production and dispersal, as well as their subsequent impacts on pollen concentrations and allergy. Climate change consequences will not be restricted to ragweed, and a recent review has highlighted a range of other pollen-producing species that may be affected (
