<p class="p">We then used the model coefficient and the estimated ln-mean pollen count in each 50 km × 50 km grid cell to estimate an RSR for each grid cell. This operation was performed on our 2 current and 12 future estimates of ragweed pollen across Europe. We combined the gridded RSR data with NUTS3 boundaries (subdivisions of the 28 EU countries into regions of 150,000–800,000 residents) and population data, to estimate the number of sensitized individuals at the NUTS3 level. These data were aggregated to the NUTS2 level (regions with 0.8–3 million residents) because many NUTS3 areas are smaller in size than the 50 km × 50 km grid cells. NUTS data were sourced from the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat). For 12 non-EU European countries, we used boundaries and population data from the Global Administrative Areas database (
