<p class="p">For the present analysis, these 14 estimates of current and future ragweed pollen were combined with health and population data to quantify their public health significance using ragweed sensitization rate (RSR) as a health consequence. Sensitization to ragweed is related to long-term pollen exposure; thus, these daily pollen outputs were aggregated to provide estimates, on a 50 km Ã— 50 km grid, of average total season ragweed pollen.</p>
