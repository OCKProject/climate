<p class="p">To produce quantitative estimates of the potential impact of future ragweed pollen levels on RSRs, we first needed to generate a dose–response curve that would be representative of populations in locations with varying ragweed pollen levels in addition to characteristics that might confound the association between pollen levels and RSRs. Although we considered using estimates from an existing multicenter study [e.g., from the Atopica® project (Atopica® 2014), the GA
