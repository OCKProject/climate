<p class="p">One striking feature of the results is the large influence of the plant invasion scenario. The reference plant invasion scenario uses the common assumption that the flux of seeds is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richter et al. 2013</xref>). The slow plant invasion scenario assumes a limited expansion in the range of ragweed, and this scenario more than halves the overall estimated increase in sensitization to ragweed projected by 2041–2060 under RCP4.5. Thus, it strongly suggests that control of ragweed is important for public health and as an adaptation strategy against the impacts of climate change. However, control of existing plants is difficult owing to ragweed’s long-lived seeds, to its ability to evolve herbicide resistance, and to its capacity to resprout following cutting (

Controlling long-distance seed dispersal is also important for preventing plant spread, which is predominantly associated with human activity. Therefore, controls over contaminated seed and monitoring areas prone to ragweed invasion are key elements to limiting spread (
