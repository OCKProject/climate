<p class="p">Climate change is likely to affect allergic disease (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al. 2014</xref>), and the view of clinical experts is that these diseases will increase under climate change (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bielory et al. 2012</xref>) in part because of the impact on allergenic plant species (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shea et al. 2008</xref>). Impacts on allergens may be one of the most important consequences of climate change for human health (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beggs 2015</xref>). Climate change has already been suggested as one factor behind the increasing prevalence of allergic asthma (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beggs and Bambrick 2005</xref>). Pollens are a major cause of symptoms in people with allergic disease, but there is no quantitative assessment of how future climate change may affect the levels of pollen allergy in humans because the influence of climate change is complex (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reid and Gamble 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al. 2014</xref>). For example, an altered climate will affect the range of allergenic species as well as the timing and length of the pollen season, and elevated carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) may increase plant productivity and pollen production (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beggs 2015</xref>). Climate change may also affect the release and atmospheric dispersion of pollen (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bielory et al. 2012</xref>). The overall impact will be alteration of pollen season timing and load, and hence, changes in exposure. Modeling all of these processes is needed to assess the consequences of climate change on pollen-related allergic disease. Previous studies (reviewed by 
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bielory et al. 2012</xref>) have only examined some of the processes along this pathway.
