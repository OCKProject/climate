<p class="p">Here, we quantify the potential consequences of climate change on pollen allergy, focusing upon the annual herbaceous plant common ragweed (
 <italic class="italic">Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic>) in Europe (henceforth referred to as ragweed). In Europe, ragweed is an introduced species in the middle of an ongoing invasion event (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Storkey et al. 2014</xref>) and, therefore, represents a case of a human population being progressively exposed to a novel allergen. Ragweed is highly invasive; it thrives on disturbed land, with each plant producing ≤ 62,000 seeds per year. Ragweed is particularly harmful for public health because each plant produces a large amount of pollen (≤ 1 billion grains a year; 
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fumanal et al. 2007</xref>), and its allergenic potential is high (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taramarcaz et al. 2005</xref>). Unlike other types of pollen, ragweed pollen peaks in the late summer (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Essl et al. 2015</xref>). In some parts of Europe, ragweed generates ~50% of the total pollen production. In the United States, where ragweed is native, &gt; 26% of the population is sensitized to ragweed (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arbes et al. 2005</xref>). This study focuses upon ragweed sensitization as a health consequence. Sensitization occurs when the human immune system has synthesized antibodies against the pollen and reacts when reexposed, and it is a major risk factor for allergic diseases such as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma (
