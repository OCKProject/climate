 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Approach is a diagnosis tool, i.e., the first step in the interactive and strategic planning process of cities to address the challenges of water, waste and climate change (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">b</xref>). The approach has been developed as one of the actions of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on water, as well as of the Watershare community (EC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2018</xref>; Watershare 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2017a</xref>). It provides an overview of the main components of the urban water cycle by means of 25 performance indicators. At present, 70 cities in more than 35 countries have been analysed based on the approach and a number of publications have been published, presenting the results for the city of Amsterdam (Van Leeuwen and Sjerps

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2017</xref>), Dar es Salaam (Van Leeuwen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2017</xref>). Moreover, the European Commission has published the ‘Urban Water Atlas for Europe’ which includes 46 City Blueprints and illustrates the role of water in European cities. The atlas is a novel approach to encourage citizens to understand the relevance of water by combining the work of scientists, artists, politicians and municipal stakeholders with work done by schoolchildren and teachers (Gawlik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>). Based on this extensive empirical database, key insights have been obtained about the various stages of transformation that cities go through in improving their Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. IWRM is defined as a process that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems and the environment (Global Water Partnership
