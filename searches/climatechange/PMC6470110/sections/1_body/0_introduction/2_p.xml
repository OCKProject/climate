<p id="Par3" class="p">Governance institutions are faced with a variety of barriers when trying to address above long-term water challenges, which may be summarised as a combination of management fragmentation, technological lock-in, institutional inertia and the challenge of reorienting professional and organisational expertise (Brown and Farrelly 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2009</xref>; Koop et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>; OECD 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2015a</xref>; Sydow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2009</xref>). These barriers also lead to limited awareness, ill-defined water challenges and a lack of cohesion between short-term targets and long-term goals, as well as inconsistencies between sectors, policies and political agendas (OECD 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015b</xref>). Often, water-related measures are taken in an uncoordinated haphazard manner whereby quick fixes are applied, neglecting the co-benefits with other water-related and other sectorial challenges in cities (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> in Koop and Van Leeuwen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2017</xref>). Measures should be taken after a thorough diagnosis (baseline assessment) in order to find the most cost-effective and efficient approach. Although an integrated and inclusive approach is often emphasised, there are only few studies that assess urban water management in a consistent and intelligible way (OECD 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015b</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2018</xref>). Hence, such an approach is much needed in order to accumulate knowledge and facilitate active engagement of citizens, private stakeholders, professionals and policy makers (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2017</xref>).
