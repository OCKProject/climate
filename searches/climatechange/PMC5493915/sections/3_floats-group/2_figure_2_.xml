  <p class="p">Additive influences of temperature anomaly (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) and acreage of Bt corn in the agricultural districts (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) during 1996–2016 on damage to Bt sweet corn (% ears damaged) by 
   <italic class="italic">Helicoverpa zea</italic>, as indicator of field-evolved resistance to Bt corn. We estimated Bt corn acreage as the product of total area of planted corn for each year in each agricultural district of Maryland, USA and the national average percentage of Bt corn for that year. We used temperature anomaly (compared to twentieth-century averages) during the growing season (April–September) of each year of the study period as a predictor. Points represent the raw data, blue line represents the predictions from LMMs, and dotted lines denote the upper and lower confidence levels (95% CI).
