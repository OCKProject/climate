  <p class="p">Influence of Bt corn acreage in the agricultural districts of Maryland, USA during 1996â€“2016 on mean instars of 
   <italic class="italic">Helicoverpa zea</italic> on Bt sweet corn, as indicator of field-evolved resistance to Bt corn. We estimated Bt corn acreage as the product of total area of planted corn for each year in each agricultural district and the national average percentage of Bt corn for that year. Points represent the raw data, blue line represents the predictions from LMMs, and dotted lines denote the upper and lower confidence levels (95% CI).
