  <p class="p">Interactive influences of temperature anomaly and acreage of Bt corn in the agricultural districts of Maryland, USA during 1996–2016 on: (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) 
   <italic class="italic">Helicoverpa zea</italic> population abundance (Mean nightly 
   <italic class="italic">H. zea</italic> captures); and indicators of field-evolved resistance to Bt corn expressed as (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) mean kernel area consumed (cm
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and (
   <italic class="italic">c</italic>) proportion of 4th–6th instars. We estimated Bt corn acreage as the product of total area of planted corn for each year in each agricultural district and the national average percentage of Bt corn for that year. We used temperature anomaly (compared to twentieth-century averages) during the growing season (April–September) of each year of the study period as a predictor. Contour plots depict the predictions from LMMs with each dependent variable scaled on the right axis, with lower values in blue and higher in red.
