 <italic class="italic">H. zea</italic> resistance to Cry1Ab is driven by environmental conditions, and a complex genetic basis underlies insect resistance to Cry1A Bt toxins in Lepidoptera species [
 <xref rid="RSOS170210C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. We endeavoured to analyse the role of key environmental factors that also changed over time and may drive resistance evolution (namely Bt adoption and climatic conditions). While we highlight the statistical association of temperature anomaly and Bt acreage, we acknowledge the correlative nature of our study and the need for further research and detailed experiments. Detailed experiments relating toxicity and resistance development at varied Bt concentrations to temperature conditions are needed to clearly identify the mechanisms through which Bt adoption and climate change interactively influence field-evolved resistance.
