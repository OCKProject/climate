 <xref rid="RSOS170210C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] resulted in high injury to Bt sweet corn. High temperatures may stress Bt crops and possibly degrade soluble proteins, resulting in decline of Cry1A toxin expression by the plant, and thereby reduced field efficacy [

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] at warmer temperatures may buffer against population reduction from Bt toxin during resistance evolution. Additionally, increased overwintering survival due to warmer temperatures, particularly reduced length of time spent at near-zero temperatures [
 <xref rid="RSOS170210C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], affect the population dynamics of target species in Bt crops and can increase the resistant allele frequency that carries over to the following spring season [
 <xref rid="RSOS170210C68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Concurrently, at regional/continental spatial scales, the southâ€“north migration of moths already selected for resistance on Bt corn and cotton, that also are Bt tolerant [
 <xref rid="RSOS170210C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], probably enhanced the development of Cry1Ab resistance in Maryland populations. The high regional deployment of Bt corn in the mid-Atlantic region, as well as further south along the migratory route of
