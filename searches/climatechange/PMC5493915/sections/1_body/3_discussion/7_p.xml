<p class="p">Our study highlights risks and limitations of Bt technology for agricultural pest management in the context of climate change. Polyphagous, migratory species such as

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and increased Bt exposure might lead to resistance development particularly in insects for which Cry proteins are moderately toxic. Hence there is a need to incorporate the evolutionary processes affected by climate change into resistance management programmes. Given the role of temperature and increased Bt adoption for resistance development, incorporating insect resistance management plans into broader integrated pest management strategies (biological control, crop rotation, etc.) could ameliorate selection pressure, and facilitate sustainability of Bt technology [
