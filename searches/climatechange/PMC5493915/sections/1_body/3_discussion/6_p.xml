<p class="p">Our results have important implications for understanding the risk of resistance increasing and spreading, sustainability of Bt technology and regional insect pest management strategies for climate change preparedness. The expansion of overwintering range north of 40° N, increased migration due to climate change [

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and the selection pressure exerted by extensive Bt acreage in mid-Atlantic, north central and northern great plains regions in the US exacerbates the risk of resistance increasing and spreading. These results highlight the necessity for adapting existing regulatory policies on refuge requirement and resistance monitoring. 
 <italic class="italic">Helicoverpa zea</italic> sampling for monitoring and testing for resistance is currently concentrated in the southern US regions where both Bt corn and Bt cotton are grown. Expanded resistance monitoring for all Cry proteins registered against corn earworm in all high corn production regions would help detect resistance development as the overwintering range of corn earworm expands due to climate change.
