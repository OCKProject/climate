<p class="p">We analysed how temperature anomaly and Bt adoption affects insect biology, transgenic crop–pest interactions, and agricultural pest management through transgenic biotechnology. Our results suggest that temperature anomaly and its interaction with increased Bt adoption accelerated the field-evolved resistance in

While the evolution of resistance with increased Bt adoption was expected, our study highlights the important interactive effect of climate change (temperature anomaly) for resistance development.
