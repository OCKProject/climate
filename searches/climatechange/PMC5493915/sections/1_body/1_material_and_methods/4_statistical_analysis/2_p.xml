<p class="p">Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) were used to analyse the influence of temperature anomaly and Bt acreage on 
 <italic class="italic">H. zea</italic> abundance and on indicators of field-evolved resistance. The LMMs contained each of the indicators (counts, damage, consumption, instar and large instar) as response variables, site as a random effect accounting for repeated measurement, and the interaction, additive, or individual effect of (log) Bt acreage and temperature anomaly as fixed effects. We tested the interactive influence of Bt acreage and temperature anomaly prior to analysing additive or individual influences. Where applicable, the response variables were square root transformed to conform to linear model assumptions.
