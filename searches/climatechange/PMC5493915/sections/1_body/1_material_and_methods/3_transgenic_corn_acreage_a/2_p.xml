<p class="p">As predictors of field-evolved resistance, we used Bt corn (including field corn) acreage in the agricultural crop districts of the study sites in Maryland (

The Bt events and Cry proteins expressed in field corn are also expressed in sweet corn (except for Cry1F). For e.g. Attribute (expressing Cry1Ab toxin, event Bt11) and Attribute II (expressing Cry1Ab and Vip3A, event MIR162) hybrids from Syngenta Seeds, and Performance Series (PS) hybrids (expressing the Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab2 toxins, event MON89034) from Seminis Seeds. Therefore, Bt field corn acreage, which represented 81% of all corn acreage in the USA in 2015, is a good measure of the evolutionary selection pressure for resistance development in 
 <italic class="italic">H. zea</italic> against Bt Cry proteins. Area under corn production differed among the study sites, representing a range of selection pressure for resistance development. Crops (particularly corn) are planted extensively around the sites on the Eastern Shore, while western Maryland sites include urban areas. We estimated the Bt corn acreage in the agricultural districts as the product of total area of corn planted each year [
