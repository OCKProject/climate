<p class="p">Currently, a key insect pest management strategy is the genetic engineering of crops through agricultural biotechnology. The period of increased temperature anomaly in the twenty-first century coincides with the proliferation of crops engineered with genes from the bacterium

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Bt crops are adopted extensively with global plantings across 28 countries reaching about 178 million hectare in 2015, from 1.1 million hectare in 1996 [

However, the implications of altered pest insect biology and phenology during warmer climate on transgenic crop–pest interactions are complex and largely unexamined. In this study, we address the role of increasing temperature anomaly and its interaction with agricultural biotechnology (Bt crops) to understand some of the indirect impacts of climate change: crop–pest interaction, efficacy of Bt corn for insect pest management and Bt resistance in insects.
