<p class="p">For all Bt corn expressing Cry toxins, the high dose requirement for resistance management is not achieved for

During 1996–2016, the rate of increase for the indicators of resistance was significantly different between Bt and non-Bt hybrids with steeper increases for Bt than non-Bt hybrids (see fig. 1

Many sweet corn farmers in Maryland, USA either have stopped growing these Bt hybrids or are applying more insecticide sprays to compensate for the reduced control efficacy.
