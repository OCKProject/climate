<p class="p">Climatic change, as indicated by the highest global average temperatures on record, impacts agricultural productivity globally. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years recorded since 1880 occurred in the twenty-first century, and land surface temperature anomaly (difference as compared to twentieth century) during 2016 reached 1.43°C [

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, crop–pest interactions and biological control effects are complex and poorly understood in the context of climate change. Direct climate impacts on pests (e.g. life-history traits) are better understood than the indirect effects (such as crop–pest interactions and biological control) resulting in a gap between the science of predicting changes and management options [
