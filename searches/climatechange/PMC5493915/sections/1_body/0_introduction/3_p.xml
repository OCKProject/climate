<p class="p">Insects are major economic pests, and increasing temperature anomalies and warming have profound influences on insect biology and agricultural pest management. Rising temperatures accelerate insect phenology [

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Polyphagous, migratory insect pest species can benefit from warmer temperatures [

 <xref rid="RSOS170210C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], although climate change effects on insects in general are varied. Migratory agricultural insect pest responses to warmer temperatures include extension of geographical and overwintering range, increased overwintering survival, accelerated population growth, increased number of generations, increased feeding injury and earlier colonization of crops. These responses may alter the crop–pest synchrony, interactions among species, and pest management strategies [
