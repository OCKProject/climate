As a result, environmental sustainability and human development along with vector-borne disease (VBD) control historically have been especially challenging in Africa, particularly in the sub-Saharan and Sahelian drylands. Here, the VBD burden, food insecurity, environmental degradation, and social vulnerability are particularly severe. Changing climate can exacerbate the legion of environmental health threats in Africa, the social dimensions of which are now part of the international development agenda. Accordingly, the need to better understand the dynamics and complex coupling of populations and environments as exemplified by drylands is increasingly recognized as critical to the design of more sustainable interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Main body</title><p id="Par2">This scoping review examines the challenge of vector-borne disease control in drylands with a focus on Africa, and the dramatic, ongoing environmental and social changes taking place. Dryland societies persisted and even flourished in the past despite changing climates, extreme and unpredictable weather, and marginal conditions for agriculture. Yet intrusive forces largely out of the control of traditional dryland societies, along with the negative impacts of globalization, have contributed to the erosion of dryland&#x02019;s cultural and natural resources. This has led to the loss of resilience underlying the adaptive capacity formerly widely exhibited among dryland societies. A growing body of evidence from studies of environmental and natural resource management demonstrates how, in light of dryland system&#x02019;s inherent complexity, these factors and top-down interventions can impede sustainable development and vector-borne disease control. Strengthening adaptive capacity through community-based, participatory methods that build on local knowledge and are tailored to local ecological conditions, hold the best promise of reversing current trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">A significant opportunity exists to simultaneously address the increasing threat of vector-borne diseases and climate change through methods aimed at strengthening adaptive capacity. The integrative framework and methods based on social-ecological systems and resilience theory offers a novel set of tools that allow multiple threats and sources of vulnerability to be addressed in combination. Integration of recent advances in vector borne disease ecology and wider deployment of these tools could help reverse the negative social and environmental trends currently seen in African drylands.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40249-019-0539-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vector-borne diseases</kwd><kwd>Integrated vector management</kwd><kwd>Complexity</kwd><kwd>Social-ecological system</kwd><kwd>Biodiversity</kwd><kwd>Resilience</kwd><kwd>Climate change adaptation</kwd><kwd>Traditional knowledge</kwd><kwd>Adaptive vector borne disease management</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec102"><title>Multilingual abstracts</title><p id="Par730">Please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for translations of the abstract into the five official working languages of the United Nations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par7">Africa is recognized as particularly challenging in terms of human development progress among the world&#x02019;s developing regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of the variety of political, economic, and environmental reasons, the continent&#x02019;s disproportionate extent of drylands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and vector-borne diseases are major contributing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Drylands, which include hyper-arid to dry sub-humid climate zones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are naturally characterized by dust storms, temperature extremes, variable rainfall and drought, low agricultural productivity, and zoonotic and vector-borne disease emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These natural hazards, already exaggerated in drylands, are exacerbated anthropogenically through deforestation and land degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], dams and irrigation projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], pesticide and anti-microbial use, vector and pathogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and political conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Adding to this, global climate change is predicted to contribute to increasing climate extremes and drought severity in African drylands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The increased climate variability will further challenge conventional vector borne disease control efforts and require adaptive approaches that include, among other tools, novel meteorological forecasting platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Africa delineating drylands.

Focusing on the integration of dryland peoples&#x02019; distinctive livelihoods and ecological circumstances are key elements of these integrative approaches, particularly in recognition of how dryland peoples&#x02019; traditional livelihoods include adaptation to extreme climate variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, mobility and migration as a means of diluting risk historically has been a common coping strategy among dryland pastoralists such as the Turkana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Dryland farmers, analogously fine-tuned cropping systems to the varying environment, including drawing on dryland&#x02019;s unique and surprisingly rich <italic>in situ</italic> repositories of traditional crop genetic resources. Thus, dryland peoples&#x02019; traditional crop production systems historically have proved highly effective in securing well-being despite harsh conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Unfortunately, increasing sedentism, including that due to forced settlement by governments among the Maasai and other pastoralist groups has undermined these strategies, and often with negative nutritional and health consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, local and traditional knowledge relevant to coping strategies remains and can be used to help restore adaptive capacity. This has been extensively documented as applicable to rural ecosystems, including drylands (i.e., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). More recently, the applicability of participatory processes, and traditional knowledge inclusion, specifically in relation to climate change adaptation employing the social-ecological systems frame, has been demonstrated for drylands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Social-ecological systems coupling in drylands extends to the complex interplay between environments, vectors of zoonotic parasites (e.g., ticks, fleas, black flies, mosquitoes and sand flies), their relationships with humans, and transmission of bacteria, viruses, protozoa or helminths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

As such, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches employing an integrative framework that can accommodate a social-ecological systems perspective and methods of analysis is required. The area referred to as social-ecological systems theory, with its unique complex systems-based conception of resilience&#x000a0;(SESR), is particularly relevant to addressing problems such as pest management (and by extension vector control). SESR represents a large body of research and practical experience applied to environmental and natural resources management problems including pest control. The fundamentals are described in several major works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] on the basis of which an expansive body of literature has developed outside of the health sciences.</p><p id="Par12">This review examines this body of research and practice as it applies to drylands and how it may provide the basis for an integrative framework for strategies that combine vector-borne diseases and climate adaptation. We conclude with suggestions for going forward with research and methodological development to further operationalize application of the SESR framework. This includes adapting SESR practice to the increasing threats posed by the interplay of vector borne disease and changing climate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Main text</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Vulnerability of dryland populations</title><p id="Par13">Dryland rural populations of the developing regions are among the most ecologically, socially and politically marginalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Their health and economic indices include higher infant mortality and income levels typically among the world lowest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Up to 20% of drylands are &#x02018;desertified&#x02019; with their populations historically subject to extreme drought while more frequent droughts are expected due to climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Rapid population increase, degradation of the land and its productive capacity, at-risk livelihoods, and migration, including of refugees fleeing environmental conditions or violent conflict, converge in some dryland areas such as the Sahel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even in the absence of these conditions, dryland peoples&#x02019; livelihoods have been among the most negatively impacted by unsustainable development schemes, in particular those associated with agricultural intensification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The expansion into dryland rural areas of &#x02018;modernization&#x02019; including changes in land management, appropriation of indigenous societies&#x02019; land by governments, development schemes involving ecologically inappropriate and culturally insensitive technologies, such as ill-designed irrigation projects, have been widely documented as contributing to drylands environmental degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Less widely studied have been the negative health consequences apparent, for example, in pastoralist populations forced to abandon their traditional practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These negative health consequences include, for example, higher levels of malnutrition and higher rates of respiratory and diarrheal morbidity in settled versus nomadic communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In general, dryland populations live under conditions of increasing insecurity due to land degradation and desertification, which tends to worsen as the productive land per capita declines with population growth. The potential for unpredictably changing patterns of vector-borne diseases associated with climate change represents a further challenge for rural populations already facing a range of social and environmental circumstances in constant flux. Ironically, the major concerns about climate change, i.e., weather extremes and climate variability, are nothing new to dryland people who can be said to be masters of adaptation to unpredictable and extreme meteorological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>High impact vector borne diseases in African drylands</title><p id="Par16">Dryland people have co-existed and co-evolved for centuries or more with a range of zoonotic and vector borne diseases some of which, like trypanosomaisis and rinderpest, have been significantly controlled or eliminated. However, many&#x02014;of which malaria, rift valley fever, typhus and schistosomiasis are most prominent&#x02014;persist today in spite of decades of intervention programs. These diseases can have significant impacts on livelihoods. Schistosomiasis for instance has profound negative effects on child development, outcomes of pregnancy, and agricultural productivity. Schistosomiasis is thus presented as a key reason why the &#x0201c;bottom 500 million&#x0201d; inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa continue to live in poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The World Organisation for Animal Health has listed a number of High Impact Diseases that must be reported because they can have a significant negative effect on the lives of humans and animals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2018/">http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2018/</ext-link>). In arid and semi-arid environments, vector-borne diseases that have a significant impact on livestock include African swine fever, lumpy skin disease, Rift Valley fever and trypanosomiasis, the last two mentioned also having direct pathological effects on humans. Ticks and tick-borne diseases have major impacts on public health and animal health all over the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. They arguably represent the most serious health threat to livestock farmer&#x02019;s livelihoods in drylands. Direct costs associated with tick-borne diseases include mortality of livestock, due to highly fatal diseases like heartwater, East Coast fever and Corridor disease, and reduced productivity due to erosive diseases such as bovine anaplasmosis. In addition, indirect costs for tick control programmes represent a significant burden for farmers, as the use of synthetic acaricides with harmful residual effects on meat and milk for human and animal consumption is still the primary method of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Vector-borne diseases and climate variability challenges unique to drylands</title><p id="Par18">Existing evidence suggests that VBD burdens will increase for people whom are already vulnerable to climate extremes, such as those in the African continent. This is notably pronounced in the dryland areas in the sub-Saharan and Sahelian region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In this region, poor agro-pastoral communities may suffer socio-economically disproportionally more from the effects of changing climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and thus may become more vulnerable to VBD threats.</p><p id="Par19">Drylands&#x02019; distinctive biophysical, socio-political and economic circumstances along with their unique vector, pathogen reservoir, and human ecologies produce transmission dynamics and thus a VBD burden specific to these bioclimatic zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This is a consequence of two sets of characteristics unique to drylands, as distinct from wetter tropical biome types (i.e. tropical forest, woodland and grassland). First, dryland&#x02019;s high mean and extreme temperatures can result in higher transmission potential of arthropod vectors. This is a consequence of the reduced vector generation time and pathogen incubation period, increased vector population growth rates, and a longer transmission period due to warmer ambient temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Second, dryland&#x02019;s high seasonal and spatial variation in rainfall results in a more aggregated distribution of primary production. This, in turn, can produce higher VBD transmission rates through increased vector-host interactions, at waterholes and preferred rangeland foraging patches, for example. This has been shown by GPS tracking studies of patterns of spatial contact between tick larvae, livestock, and wildlife hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Climate change is expected to further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, which deserves particular attention in the context of vector-borne diseases for the above reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, diseases will be differentially affected by climate parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. It is anticipated for instance that mosquito-borne disease risk could increase as a result of the effect of increasingly localized heavy rainfall on vector breeding opportunities as demonstrated for mosquito vectors of Rift valley fever in Southern and Eastern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] or Malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. On the other hand, repeated drought conditions encourage the storage of drinking water by local populations for human and livestock consumption. This will in turn increase the number of breeding sites for mosquitoes, such as <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> the primary vectors of dengue in endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Alternatively, increased rainfall variability may have an inhibiting effect on other vectors thus VBDs, for example, leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Drylands are also characterised by socio-economic features which affect transmission dynamics and the burden of VBDs, including livelihood, demography, social organization, and health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Semi-arid regions are particularly sensitive to climate variability because the main livelihoods of their people, pastoralism and/or rain-fed agriculture, rely heavily on ecosystem functions associated with primary production such as soil erosion, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and water run-off and infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Some researchers have observed lower adaptive capacity in drier zones exhibited in the form of population&#x02019;s more limited coping strategies, which in turn may contribute to increased VBD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Changing livelihoods/land use and increased vulnerability</title><p id="Par22">Historically, as already suggested above, pastoralists in arid and semi-arid drylands relied on mobility and migration as an adaptive strategy to cope with low and highly variable rangeland productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, access to productive rangeland has shrunk, while pastoralist, and thus livestock populations, have grown along with land use conflicts. Exclusion from, or limitations placed on traditional livelihood and cultural practices have accompanied the establishment and increased enforcement of boundaries of protected areas, cropland expansion made possible through irrigation infrastructure development, and privatization of formally communal lands. These factors, and the increased land use conflicts have pushed pastoralists into dryer, more marginally productive rangelands. These marginal areas often include habitat for arthropod vectors (e.g. tsetse flies) and wildlife serving as reservoirs for zoonotic disease (e.g., trypanosomosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The presence of livestock herds on the edges of, or encroaching into, protected areas increases the risk of pathogen spill-over from wildlife. This is illustrated by the case of (non-vectorial) transmission of bovine tuberculosis in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and could also be the case for several vector-borne parasites from wildlife. This has been little studied despite their zoonotic potential, such as that of filarids from wild mammals (e.g., <italic>Onchocerca</italic> spp., <italic>Dipetalonema</italic> spp. and <italic>Loaina</italic> spp.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Other factors indirectly associated with changing livelihood and land use may contribute to dryland population&#x02019;s increased vulnerability to VBDs and climate change. Social inequality and political marginalization of certain dryland groups has been shown to increase disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Similarly, poorer health among dryland people in general is associated with a lack of political voice or ability to negotiate power relations, and limited access to resources, technologies and networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. For instance, increased exposure of pastoralists, hired herders and inhabitants of poor villages to Rift Valley fever vectors is often unaccounted for when irrigation schemes are sited nearby, while others pushed into marginal lands are at increased VBD risk as described above.</p><p id="Par25">Sedentism, urbanization, and the livelihood shifts they imply in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in other less-developed parts of the world, are also strongly associated with increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. This, in turn, can increase communicable disease risk, including that of VBDs. For example, the link between malaria and non-communicable diseases has been documented in several reports including a case-control study of 1466 urban adults in Ghana. This study found that patients with type 2 diabetes had a 46% increased risk for infection with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Thus, increasing diabetes may contribute to malaria risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

The adaptive cycle explains why historically, in most cases, management efforts have failed (e.g., most managed fisheries have either collapsed or have been over-fished, and efforts to control floods or pests frequently have resulted in worse floods or pest outbreaks). Common to all these is the aim of controlling a target variable (e.g., an insect pest) typically top down and with limited consideration of underlying changes taking place in the system over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The adaptive cycle showing how changes in social-ecological&#x000a0;systems characteristically exhibit two phases.

The complexity of living systems is largely a manifestation of this nested, hierarchical structure and associated dynamics involving interactions between levels (representing different&#x000a0;space and time scales). The adaptive cycle has proven useful for revealing how larger scale dynamics (e.g., land use and climate change) interact with smaller scale dynamics (e.g., revolts or insect outbreaks) to produce unexpected consequences.

They point out how insecticides and anti-malarial drugs used to control transmission typically achieve success, but only initially. The success reinforces the commitment to this top down approach (e.g.&#x000a0;limited community involvement in vector control), while chemical and drug resistance eventually appears in the vector and parasite populations. Meanwhile, the proportion of susceptible humans has grown as a result of reduced transmission. As a&#x000a0;consequence, the risk of an outbreak has increased while the ability to control it decreases.</p><p id="Par40">This progression corresponds to the first two phases of the adaptive cycle and a &#x0201c;pathology of disease control&#x0201d;&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in which institutions become increasingly inflexible (conservative) after initial success in controlling a disease, followed by a period of denial as warning signs go unheeded until a crisis develops.
