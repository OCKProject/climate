  <p class="p">Map of Africa delineating drylands. This shows the geographic distributions of each of the four dryland types: hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid. Each of these zones exhibits the characteristics inherent to drylands described in the text, including naturally greater climate variability than other biomes, However, Hyper-arid and Arid zones both naturally exhibit more and increasingly extreme climate and environmental conditions, including climate variability, which are expected to increase in the coming decades [
