  <p class="p">Adaptive management of Vector-borne disease (VBD) risk in a pastoral grazing system. The figure shows the linkages between social and ecological aspects as uncovered by dryland researchers, with VBD transmission added by the work reported in the present study. The economic/livelihood benefits of ecosystem functions can be extended to include the mitigation of VBD transmission associated with landscape function. Similarly, the local knowledge of Human-Environment (H-E) interactions include how livestock management decisions in consideration of external drivers effect landscape function associated with VBD transmission.
