 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. They point out how insecticides and anti-malarial drugs used to control transmission typically achieve success, but only initially. The success reinforces the commitment to this top down approach (e.g. limited community involvement in vector control), while chemical and drug resistance eventually appears in the vector and parasite populations. Meanwhile, the proportion of susceptible humans has grown as a result of reduced transmission. As a consequence, the risk of an outbreak has increased while the ability to control it decreases.
