<p id="Par43" class="p">In addition to these studies pointing to VBD emergence as proximally a consequence of landscape level dynamics several others have specifically drawn on principles developed in landscape ecology. This ecology subdiscipline is particularly relevant to understanding VDB transmission dynamics thus control. Continually changing land use mosaics viewed at the scale of human interaction (typically hectares or multiple square kilometers in the case of pastoralist movements), including varying physical structure and processes involving abiotic and biotic components, is the central focus of the field of landscape ecology [
