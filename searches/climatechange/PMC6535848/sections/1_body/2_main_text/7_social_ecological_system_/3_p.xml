<p id="Par40" class="p">This progression corresponds to the first two phases of the adaptive cycle and a “pathology of disease control” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] in which institutions become increasingly inflexible (conservative) after initial success in controlling a disease, followed by a period of denial as warning signs go unheeded until a crisis develops. A remarkable feature of the adaptive cycle is its demonstration of how disease emergence results from the interaction of variables on vastly different time and space scales [

This contrasts with the large and slow dynamics involving susceptibility (change in herd immunity in the human population). In this example, the disease system exhibits resilience.
