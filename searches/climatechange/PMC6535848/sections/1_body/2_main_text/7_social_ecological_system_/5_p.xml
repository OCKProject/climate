<p id="Par42" class="p">These ideas remain to be imported into VBD research and interventions, as it requires bridging the relatively large disciplinary gap separating biomedical science and ecology, as also found for biomedicine and social sciences [

Waltner-Toews was the first in the biomedical research community to suggest emerging infectious diseases as representing failures “to understand the socio-ecological systems we live in, and failures to respond to new understandings as they are uncovered” [

Subsequently, others specifically described the applicability of SESR framing and how zoonotic and VDB transmission dynamics, particularly the current era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, is largely driven by land use change (i.e., urbanization, agriculture intensification, deforestation) affecting host-parasite dynamics at the landscape level [
