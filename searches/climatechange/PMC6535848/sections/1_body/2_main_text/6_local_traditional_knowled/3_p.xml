<p id="Par36" class="p">Understanding how these societies exploit and manipulate biodiversity sustainably is key to understanding the resilience of dryland social-ecological systems particularly in light of increasing threats associated with climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>]. Stafford-Smith et al. elaborated on how dryland traditional and modern grazing systems function to maintain resilience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. This could best be described as a coevolutionary “dance” in which pastoralists keep step with a continually changing environment, accounting for risks while seeking to maximize benefits in the form of livestock production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Behind much of the dynamic behavior of this dryland system is the idea of ‘landscape function’, which reflects and produces the variation expressed in the variety of species of plants, animals, and microbes. Managing VBD outbreak risk can be included in this scheme, in the context of ‘landscape function,’ as noted in Fig.
