<p id="Par37" class="p">Landscape function is described as the capacity of a landscape to regulate nutrients and waterÂ and toconcentrate them in vegetated patches where soil biota maintain nutrient cycles and water infiltration, impeding runoff thus soil erosion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Vector species are of course a component of this system, and their changing distributions and abundances regulated by it. Loss of landscape function is the loss of this variability and increased homogeneity, thus dysregulation potentially including that of vector abundance.
