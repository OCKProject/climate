<p id="Par28" class="p">Understanding the strategies used for dealing with dryland environmental constraints and uncertainty, particularly in relation to biodiversity and climate variability, has advanced significantly. This includes understanding the dynamics of ‘coupled human-natural systems’ taking into account human and natural ecologies, and the multiple layers of interaction among them (e.g. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]) applied specifically to drylands systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. In fact, discovery of an intricate, complex, and dynamic relationship between resource management systems and dryland ecosystems contributed importantly to the development of complex social-ecological systems as a body of theory and practice [
