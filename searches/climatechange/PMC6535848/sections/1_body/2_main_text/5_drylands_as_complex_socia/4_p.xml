<p id="Par31" class="p">At the core of SESR as a theory of change is the “adaptive cycle”, described as metaphorical, analytical tool for understanding social-ecological systems. Numerous studies of a wide range of “managed” and unmanaged or primarily natural ecosystems tend to follow the “figure 8” pathway characterized by two phases: exploitation (growth) and conservation, and release (or collapse) and reorganization as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The adaptive cycle explains why historically, in most cases, management efforts have failed (e.g., most managed fisheries have either collapsed or have been over-fished, and efforts to control floods or pests frequently have resulted in worse floods or pest outbreaks). Common to all these is the aim of controlling a target variable (e.g., an insect pest) typically top down and with limited consideration of underlying changes taking place in the system over time [
