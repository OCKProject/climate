<p id="Par32" class="p">Adaptive cycles are cycles exhibited by human systems and natural systems, as coupled human-natural systems, at multiple levels of organization: individuals, communities, watersheds or river basins, and ultimately, globally speaking in theory, the biosphere. These cycles are exhibited by each of the smaller scale entities (subsystems) nested in the larger ones. The complexity of living systems is largely a manifestation of this nested, hierarchical structure and associated dynamics involving interactions between levels (representing different space and time scales). The adaptive cycle has proven useful for revealing how larger scale dynamics (e.g., land use and climate change) interact with smaller scale dynamics (e.g., revolts or insect outbreaks) to produce unexpected consequences. It can also be used for retrospective analysis to investigate  why and how abrupt and even catastrophic changes occur [
