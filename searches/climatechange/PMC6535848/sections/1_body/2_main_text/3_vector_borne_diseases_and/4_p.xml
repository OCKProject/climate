<p id="Par21" class="p">Drylands are also characterised by socio-economic features which affect transmission dynamics and the burden of VBDs, including livelihood, demography, social organization, and health systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Semi-arid regions are particularly sensitive to climate variability because the main livelihoods of their people, pastoralism and/or rain-fed agriculture, rely heavily on ecosystem functions associated with primary production such as soil erosion, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and water run-off and infiltration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Some researchers have observed lower adaptive capacity in drier zones exhibited in the form of populationâ€™s more limited coping strategies, which in turn may contribute to increased VBD risk [
