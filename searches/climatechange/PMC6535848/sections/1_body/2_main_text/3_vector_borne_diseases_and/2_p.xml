<p id="Par19" class="p">Drylands’ distinctive biophysical, socio-political and economic circumstances along with their unique vector, pathogen reservoir, and human ecologies produce transmission dynamics and thus a VBD burden specific to these bioclimatic zones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. This is a consequence of two sets of characteristics unique to drylands, as distinct from wetter tropical biome types (i.e. tropical forest, woodland and grassland). First, dryland’s high mean and extreme temperatures can result in higher transmission potential of arthropod vectors. This is a consequence of the reduced vector generation time and pathogen incubation period, increased vector population growth rates, and a longer transmission period due to warmer ambient temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. Second, dryland’s high seasonal and spatial variation in rainfall results in a more aggregated distribution of primary production. This, in turn, can produce higher VBD transmission rates through increased vector-host interactions, at waterholes and preferred rangeland foraging patches, for example. This has been shown by GPS tracking studies of patterns of spatial contact between tick larvae, livestock, and wildlife hosts [
