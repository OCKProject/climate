<p id="Par20" class="p">Climate change is expected to further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, which deserves particular attention in the context of vector-borne diseases for the above reasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. However, diseases will be differentially affected by climate parameters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. It is anticipated for instance that mosquito-borne disease risk could increase as a result of the effect of increasingly localized heavy rainfall on vector breeding opportunities as demonstrated for mosquito vectors of Rift valley fever in Southern and Eastern Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] or Malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. On the other hand, repeated drought conditions encourage the storage of drinking water by local populations for human and livestock consumption. This will in turn increase the number of breeding sites for mosquitoes, such as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Alternatively, increased rainfall variability may have an inhibiting effect on other vectors thus VBDs, for example, leishmaniasis [
