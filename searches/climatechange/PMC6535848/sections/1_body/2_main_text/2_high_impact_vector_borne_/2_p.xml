<p id="Par17" class="p">The World Organisation for Animal Health has listed a number of High Impact Diseases that must be reported because they can have a significant negative effect on the lives of humans and animals (

In arid and semi-arid environments, vector-borne diseases that have a significant impact on livestock include African swine fever, lumpy skin disease, Rift Valley fever and trypanosomiasis, the last two mentioned also having direct pathological effects on humans. Ticks and tick-borne diseases have major impacts on public health and animal health all over the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. They arguably represent the most serious health threat to livestock farmerâ€™s livelihoods in drylands. Direct costs associated with tick-borne diseases include mortality of livestock, due to highly fatal diseases like heartwater, East Coast fever and Corridor disease, and reduced productivity due to erosive diseases such as bovine anaplasmosis. In addition, indirect costs for tick control programmes represent a significant burden for farmers, as the use of synthetic acaricides with harmful residual effects on meat and milk for human and animal consumption is still the primary method of control [
