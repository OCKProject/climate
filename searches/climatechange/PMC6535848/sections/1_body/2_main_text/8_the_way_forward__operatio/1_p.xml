<p id="Par45" class="p">SESR-framed drylands research has revealed how dryland ecosystems, either with minimal human activity or those exploited by traditional pastoralist societies, maintain relatively high levels of resilience. This contrasts with numerous cases in which social-ecological system dysfunction (i.e., a systemic pathology exhibited as repeated episodes of degradation) where resilience has been compromised. This includes the adaptiveÂ governance of VBDs, climate change adaptive capacity as well as that required to manage the potential for climate change to exacerbate VBD threats.</p>
