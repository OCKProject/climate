<p id="Par25" class="p">Sedentism, urbanization, and the livelihood shifts they imply in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in other less-developed parts of the world, are also strongly associated with increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]. This, in turn, can increase communicable disease risk, including that of VBDs. For example, the link between malaria and non-communicable diseases has been documented in several reports including a case-control study of 1466 urban adults in Ghana. This study found that patients with type 2 diabetes had a 46% increased risk for infection with
