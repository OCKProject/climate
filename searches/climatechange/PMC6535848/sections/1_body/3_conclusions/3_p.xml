<p id="Par58" class="p">A literature does not yet exist describing intervention-oriented research that involves community-based participatory research and practice that combines climate change adaptation and vector-borne disease control. Evidence from studies across separate literatures strongly suggests a significant untapped potential in this regard. Thus, further development and testing of transdisciplinary-participatory action research methods around knowledge, both formal and local or traditional, of meteorology, human and vector ecology, and landscape dynamics should be a priority.</p>
