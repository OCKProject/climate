<p id="Par8" class="p">Application of the new understandings of environmental change and human adaptation recently generated by interdisciplinary studies examining social and ecological dimensions and their linkages in dryland systems will also be required. Among these, those employing integrative, ecosystem-oriented approaches and sustainability science offer a promising alternative to conventional drylands development approaches of the past, and renewed hope for reversing the above trends [

Focusing on the integration of dryland peoples’ distinctive livelihoods and ecological circumstances are key elements of these integrative approaches, particularly in recognition of how dryland peoples’ traditional livelihoods include adaptation to extreme climate variability [
