 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], span multiple disciplines including but not limited to the biomedical, public health, and environmental sciences. As such, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches employing an integrative framework that can accommodate a social-ecological systems perspective and methods of analysis is required. The area referred to as social-ecological systems theory, with its unique complex systems-based conception of resilienceÂ (SESR), is particularly relevant to addressing problems such as pest management (and by extension vector control). SESR represents a large body of research and practical experience applied to environmental and natural resources management problems including pest control. The fundamentals are described in several major works [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] on the basis of which an expansive body of literature has developed outside of the health sciences.
