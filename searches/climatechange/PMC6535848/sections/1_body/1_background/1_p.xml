<p id="Par7" class="p">Africa is recognized as particularly challenging in terms of human development progress among the world’s developing regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Of the variety of political, economic, and environmental reasons, the continent’s disproportionate extent of drylands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>] and vector-borne diseases are major contributing factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Drylands, which include hyper-arid to dry sub-humid climate zones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) are naturally characterized by dust storms, temperature extremes, variable rainfall and drought, low agricultural productivity, and zoonotic and vector-borne disease emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. These natural hazards, already exaggerated in drylands, are exacerbated anthropogenically through deforestation and land degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>], dams and irrigation projects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], pesticide and anti-microbial use, vector and pathogen resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>], and political conflict [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Adding to this, global climate change is predicted to contribute to increasing climate extremes and drought severity in African drylands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. The increased climate variability will further challenge conventional vector borne disease control efforts and require adaptive approaches that include, among other tools, novel meteorological forecasting platforms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>].
