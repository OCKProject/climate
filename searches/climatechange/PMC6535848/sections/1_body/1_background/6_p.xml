<p id="Par12" class="p">This review examines this body of research and practice as it applies to drylands and how it may provide the basis for an integrative framework for strategies that combine vector-borne diseases and climate adaptation. We conclude with suggestions for going forward with research and methodological development to further operationalize application of the SESR framework. This includes adapting SESR practice to the increasing threats posed by the interplay of vector borne disease and changing climate.</p>
