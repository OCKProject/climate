 <p class="p">Many studies demonstrate that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>) can promote root nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in legumes such as lucerne (
  <italic class="italic">Medicago sativa</italic>). But when elevated temperature (eT) conditions are applied in tandem with eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, a more realistic scenario for future climate change, the positive effects of eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> on nodulation and BNF in 
  <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> are often much reduced. Silicon (Si) supplementation of 
  <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> has also been reported to promote root nodulation and BNF, so could potentially restore the positive effects of eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> under eT. Increased nitrogen availability, however, could also increase host suitability for aphid pests, potentially negating any benefit. We applied eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> (+240 ppm) and eT (+4Â°C), separately and in combination, to 
  <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> growing in Si supplemented (Si+) and un-supplemented soil (Si-) to determine whether Si moderated the effects of eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and eT. Plants were either inoculated with the aphid 
  <italic class="italic">Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> or insect-free. In Si- soils, eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> stimulated plant growth by 67% and nodulation by 42%, respectively, whereas eT reduced these parameters by 26 and 48%, respectively. Aphids broadly mirrored these effects on Si- plants, increasing colonization rates under eCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and performing much worse (reduced abundance and colonization) under eT when compared to ambient conditions, confirming our hypothesized link between root nodulation, plant growth, and pest performance. Examined across all CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature regimes, Si supplementation promoted plant growth (+93%), and root nodulation (+50%). 
  <italic class="italic">A. pisum</italic> abundance declined sharply under eT conditions and was largely unaffected by Si supplementation. In conclusion, supplementing 
  <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> with Si had consistent positive effects on plant growth and nodulation under different CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature scenarios. These findings offer potential for using Si supplementation to maintain legume productivity under predicted climate change scenarios without making legumes more susceptible to insect pests.
