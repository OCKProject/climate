  <p class="p">Graphical summary showing how Si supplementation affects 
   <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> growth, root nodulation and susceptibility to 
   <italic class="italic">A. pisum</italic> in current and predicted changes to the climate and atmosphere. Compared with ambient CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature conditions 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold>, eCO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> had beneficial effects on plant growth and nodulation 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold>, but these were negated when acting in combination with predicted increases in temperature 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold>. Si supplementation 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> restored root nodulation to comparable levels as those seen under eCO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> conditions (without warming) and stimulated plant growth beyond this. Aphid responses were decoupled from changes in nodulation and growth with Si supplementation.
