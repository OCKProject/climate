<p class="p">Despite increasing evidence that the effects of eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are often modified by eT, and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>, comparatively few studies manipulate both factors in tandem (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on plant traits were not seen to the same extent when eT conditions were applied. This study therefore lends support to the notion that, wherever feasible, multiple environmental factors should be tested (
