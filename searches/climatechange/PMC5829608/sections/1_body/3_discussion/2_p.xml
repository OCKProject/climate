<p class="p">Aphid abundance was strongly suppressed by eT and this most likely explains why aphids did not benefit from increases in plant growth and nodulation that arose under Si+ conditions under eT. While aphid numbers often increase with higher temperatures via faster development and increased fecundity, this increase ceases abruptly over a certain temperature threshold because of the adverse effects on, for example, embryo development and maturation (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ryalls and Harrington, 2017</xref>). This temperature threshold depends on species, aphid biotype, and geographical region (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ryalls, 2016</xref>) and temperatures above 28°C are likely to reduce aphid growth and development (
