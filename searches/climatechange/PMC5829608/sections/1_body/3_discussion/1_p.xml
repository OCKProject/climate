<p class="p">Results from this study suggest that Si supplementation may mitigate the negative impacts of eT on plant growth in 
 <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> which was potentially due to stimulation of root nodulation, despite the reduction in nodulation at higher temperatures reported in previous studies (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ryalls et al., 2013b</xref>). Even more advantageously, this increased nodulation did not increase susceptibility to an aphid pest at eT, which had previously been observed for Si-induced increases in nodulation at ambient temperatures (
