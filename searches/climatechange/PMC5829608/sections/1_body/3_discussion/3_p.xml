<p class="p">Several studies using temperature gradient greenhouses have examined the impacts of eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and eT on legume performance, including root nodulation (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). These studies report a general trend for eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> promoting nodulation, but only at the elevated experimental temperatures. This was probably because the elevated temperature range used in experiments (c. 24°C; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aranjuelo et al., 2008</xref>) was still within the optimal range (19–25°C) for nodulation in temperate legumes, so inhibitory effects of temperature on nodulation wouldn’t necessarily have occurred (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</xref>). When temperature was elevated beyond 25–30°C, root nodulation in

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (aCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and by 56% under eCO
