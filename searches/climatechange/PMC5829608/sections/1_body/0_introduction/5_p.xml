<p class="p">The objective of this study was to determine how eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and eT, acting alone and in combination, affected root nodulation and plant growth in 
 <italic class="italic">Medicago sativa</italic> in untreated (Si-) and Si supplemented (Si+) soil. We additionally aimed to establish whether these factors affected the abundance and colonization success of an insect herbivore (the aphid 
 <italic class="italic">Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>). We hypothesized that eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases growth and root nodulation in 
 <italic class="italic">M. sativa</italic> but eT negates these effects. Si supplementation increases nodulation, even under eT, and therefore maximizes plant growth regardless of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature conditions. We hypothesized that aphid abundance would be positively linked to plant growth and nodulation, whether driven by Si supplementation or changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature conditions.
