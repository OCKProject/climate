<p class="p">Soil conditions play an important role in determining the extent to which eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and eT affect root nodulation in legumes (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aranjuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies report that supplementation of soil silicon (Si) levels promotes growth in legumes (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Miyake and Takahashi, 1985</xref>;

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>), though we know less about the functional role of Si in legumes compared to other plant families such as the Poaceae (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cooke and Leishman, 2011</xref>). Moreover, Si supplementation can increase rates of root nodulation and symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mali and Aery, 2008</xref>). However, how these positive effects of Si on nodulation are affected by eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or eT, alone or in combination, have not yet been addressed. If Si could maintain nodulation rates under future climate change scenarios, such as eT, which usually decrease it, then such supplementation could be important in the mitigation of climate change impacts on agriculture.
