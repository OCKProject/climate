<p class="p">Eighty lucerne plants were grown in each of four CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature-controlled glasshouse chambers (320 plants in total) using a fully factorial design of ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (aCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; 400 μmol mol

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (640 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) at ambient (aT) and elevated temperature (ambient + 4°C; eT). aT was set at 26/18°C day/night representing the average daily temperature (November to May) over the past 30 years for Richmond, NSW, Australia (Australian Bureau of Meteorology). eT (30/22°C day/ night) replicated the maximum predicted temperature increase for this region within this century (

Environmental conditions were monitored continuously throughout the experiment and temperature readings were verified with portable temperature loggers. To minimize ‘chamber effects’ associated with using four chambers, plants were circulated within each chamber every 5 days (apart from when plants were inoculated with aphids to avoid dislodgement of the insects) and chambers were swapped every c. 10 days by transferring plants between chambers and adjusting the environmental conditions accordingly. While this does not eliminate pseudoreplication, using this approach in these chambers has provided matching empirical results to fully replicated experiments, whether using multiple chamber replicates or multiple experimental runs (
