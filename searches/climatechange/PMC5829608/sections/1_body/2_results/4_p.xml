 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). In contrast, eT caused substantial declines (-65%) in aphid abundance and reduced their ability to colonize plants, falling by 48 and 43% on Si- and Si+ plants, respectively (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Aphid populations at eT were similar regardless of Si treatments. In short, aphid abundance was always lowest at 30Â°C and Si promotion of plant growth and nodulation was decoupled from aphid performance, such that Si+ conditions led to increased nodulation (and potentially BNF) without increasing aphid numbers.
