<p class="p">Root nodulation increased when plants grew under eCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (+27%) and Si+ conditions (+50%) (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>), but eT caused significant declines in nodulation (-32%). In Si- soil, root nodulation patterns generally mirrored changes in plant growth (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>
 </bold>, respectively). Levels of root nodulation were universally high in plants growing in Si+ soil and other factors (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, temperature, and aphid presence) no longer had significant impacts (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>
 </bold>). This was particularly true for the negative impacts of eT, which was reversed under Si+ conditions, reflected by the significant interaction of these treatments (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Our rudimentary estimate of nodule density (nodules per unit of root depth) suggested this was not affected by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (other than the weak interaction described below) but declined by 25% under eT (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). Nodule density increased (c. +45%) under Si+ conditions and, like nodule abundance, there was a significant interaction between Si treatment and temperature, whereby negative effects of eT were reversed under Si+ conditions (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). There was a very weak interaction between Si, aphids, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>.
