<p class="p">Modelling and global studies predicted that changes in climate may be a significant extinction driver in the tropics [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and particularly for the tropical Andes high plant extinction rates are expected [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Tropical species may be especially susceptible to 21st century changing climates due to the fact that communities have evolved under less variable temperatures at distinct temporal scales than those inhabiting high-latitude climates. This high sensitivity to temperature has been already measured in the field showing decelerating growth of tropical trees with subtle increases in average temperature [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and also reduced precipitation [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Species with an overall wide distribution but locally restricted to mountain habitats of the northern Andes may suffer increase risk of extinction. This is the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic>, the only conifer of Yungas forests with a key role in the community and ecosystem, which adds urgency to the design of conservation actions.
