 <xref rid="RSOS180513C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], we described genetic patterns along the 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> range. Northern populations show reduced genetic diversity, which may negatively affect adaptability, increasing stress intolerance and susceptibility to diseases, thus limiting their capacity to respond to future scenarios. Severe reductions in suitability are also predicted for central populations and consequently the concomitant genetic losses, given that some of these populations hold unique isozyme variants (e.g. 15. San Lorenzo population) or exclusive chloroplast DNA haplotypes (e.g. 10. San Andres population) [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Hence, possible local extinction of these populations prompts an aggravating factor that may potentially impact on the species’ gene pool due to the loss of unique genetic variants and elevated haplotype diversity present in this area [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. A critical situation occurs towards the southern distribution because the model predicts total loss of optimal conditions (
 <xref rid="RSOS180513TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>). Populations located in an area between 22 and 23° S latitude are genetically heterogeneous and hold relatively high genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and one unique chloroplast haplotype [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Thus future 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> establishment will be limited and the forest will probably be maintained by surviving adult trees. Under this new scenario, and considering that 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> is a cold-tolerant species (or at least sensitive to warm), high-elevation southernmost areas should be considered the first priority in conservation actions as they could function as refuge areas for this and other species ecologically associated with this currently cold subtropical forest.
