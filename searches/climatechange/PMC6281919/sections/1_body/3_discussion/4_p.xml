<p class="p">The future model predicts that southern populations of the distribution will have a combination of precipitation and temperature that will cause the species to become locally extinct due to hydric and thermal stress intolerance. While in the northern part of the distribution, although one of the most relevant variables of the model, i.e. summer temperature and precipitation, may go into an unfavourable state and the other may not, the condition of both favourable (optimal) variables for the species would not exist. Thus, only the combination of hot temperature and optimum precipitation or optimum temperature and dry climate can be achieved. These combinations of increased precipitation and temperature may facilitate the entry of neotropical species (tolerant to hot climates) that would outcompete
