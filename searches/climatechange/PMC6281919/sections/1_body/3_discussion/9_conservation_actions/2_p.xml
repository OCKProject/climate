 <xref rid="RSOS180513C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The interpretation of ENNMs results in light of genetic data can contribute to the identification of wild populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic>, which may be considered conservation priorities under a climate change scenario, as a northern Monteagudo and southern Concepcion population that harbour unique haplotypes and in turn are already under unsuitable hot and dry conditions. The most drastic situation is predicted for southern populations that will be susceptible to local extinction by low precipitation and high temperatures. The southern area is considered a hotspot of endemicity and its inclusion in a system of protected areas has been previously recommended [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. We suggest prioritizing conservation actions in both current and future areas of importance for 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei,</italic> as suggested by Altamirano 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Along with the loss of southern subtropical 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic>, the whole mountain ecosystem will be threatened, because this conifer characterizes montane forests and many species depend on it such as epiphytes, ferns and birds [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Thus, cloud forests will probably remain as relict vegetation in more humid physiographical units, such as ravines on southern slopes. The collapse of an entire community can exceptionally occur with the demise of a single ‘keystone’ species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic>, which is the dominant unique conifer of tropical-subtropical montane habitats. Loss of native forest is a key conservation concern globally, for reasons of biodiversity conservation, climate change and ecosystem services [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Distribution models, developed with calibrated climate variables [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], agree with the general pattern of future retraction and upward migration of premontane forest along the Andes. Thus, long-term germplasm preservation of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> populations is recommended by maintaining a seed bank or through 
 <italic class="italic">ex situ</italic> cultivation of specimens in arboreta as well as urgent 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> conservation actions [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], particularly of populations outside protected areas, in order to counteract inbreeding and maladaptive effects [
