<p class="p">Specifically, we can affirm a general trend of squeeze of the entire 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> range, because the conditions will vary locally, so that precipitation and temperature have an additional effect that can be exacerbated at particular local areas, to the detriment of the species' environmental niche. Effectively, 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> is affected by precipitation and the temperature of the warmest quartile, its optimum condition being the combination of moderate precipitation (400–575 mm) and mean temperature (17.5°–22.2°C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS180513F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). Throughout 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> distribution the temperature condition is determined by elevation, while the wet season is associated with wet summers. However, if the summer becomes dry or warmer, the environmental niche is lost. As the species inhabits a narrow mountainous area, and is already at the treeline, 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> would only survive at microsites, which will represent refuges for cold-tolerant species inhabiting low latitudes.
