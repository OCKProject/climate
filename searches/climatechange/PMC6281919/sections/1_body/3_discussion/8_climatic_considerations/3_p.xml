<p class="p">In general, in most climate change studies, the displacement of species is attributed to changes in temperature, and for taxa inhabiting altitudinal gradients the upward displacement hypothesis prevails in response to thermal conditions [

 <xref rid="RSOS180513C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. However, in our focal species, the precipitation of the warmest quartile has the highest percentage contribution to the model, and this combined with the temperature of the warmest quartile are the variables that most strongly (i.e. 73% contribution to the model) condition suitability. Therefore, in a mountain environment of subtropical latitudes, whether the species is characterized as cold tolerant or not apparently does not imply that thermal changes are the ones that most strongly modify its environmental niche, but rather water stress during hot periods.
