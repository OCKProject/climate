<p class="p">Contemporary plant range changes are most frequently reported for mountain regions, with upward elevational shifts of the mountain treeline being the most commonly documented response to increasing temperatures [

 <xref rid="RSOS180513C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] detected upslope shifts in response to temperature changes in 38 Andean tree genera. Also future ecological niche modelling for 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus acuminata</italic> predicts losses in the low-elevation areas of the montane cloud forest and gains at higher altitudes in response to higher temperature. An upward shift of premontane forest was suggested as a general response of all Yungas vegetation strips, so that a general increase in the altitudinal levels was expected along the Andes [

 <xref rid="RSOS180513C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. From the many climate change studies, it was shown that predicted responses of taxa will depend on species' tolerance to rising temperatures and their ability to migrate, combined with anthropogenic land degradation and/or reduced availability of suitable habitats, resulting in rapid losses of potential areas and high risks of extinction [
