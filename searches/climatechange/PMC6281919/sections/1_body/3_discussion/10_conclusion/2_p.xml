<p class="p">A high consensus among 13 future climate models shows that 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> will experience an overall range squeeze of its currently occupied total area due to combined drying/warming trends that prevent the opening of new suitable areas for the species, thus substantially threatening the persistence of the species as a whole. Given that loss of native forest is a key conservation concern globally, urgent measures are needed to conserve 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> in order to preserve the ecosystem services that such a unique conifer provides in montane forests along the subtropical Andes.
