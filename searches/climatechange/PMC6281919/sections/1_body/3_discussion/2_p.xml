<p class="p">The models projected for 2050 and 2070 are surprising in their predictions because, contrary to expectations for latitudinal expansion, i.e. poleward migrations or altitudinal change, the subtropical 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> will locally shrink its range. While we cannot discard the possibility for potential upward migration as predicted for montane taxa, the evidence presented here strongly suggests that all populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> will be affected by the new climatic conditions. It was suggested that the main risks related to projected climatic changes for the twenty-first century are linked to either high variation of local climates, development of novel climates, or the disappearance of extant climates [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Our results are in concert with the significant modification as well as the loss for local conditions suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> persistence under changing climates. Therefore, the local extinction of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> populations seems to be the inevitable outcome under the tested scenarios. We also hereby show that the combined effects of changing temperatures and the modification of precipitation regimes may lead to unexpected and previously underestimated local ecological responses.
