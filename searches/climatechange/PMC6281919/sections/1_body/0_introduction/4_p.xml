<p class="p">Traits that enable species to persist in a particular ecological environment are often maintained over time, a phenomenon known as niche conservatism [

Unless they are capable of rapidly adapting or adjusting through plasticity and/or shifting their distributions poleward and/or upward as is required to remain within their thermal niches, many species are predicted to experience range contractions and high local population extinction risks [

Thus, populations formerly confined to cool mountaintops will tend to lose habitat typically consisting of highly unsuitable rocky substrates or will be virtually eradicated from the top of lower mountains as found in the Guayana Highlands [
