<p class="p">Potential range shifts of species tracking their optimum climate as well as the detection of populations at risk of local extinction in the short term can be successfully predicted using models such as ecological niche modelling [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] or environmental niche models (ENNMs). ENNMs are useful tools for projecting potential shifts in the distributions of suitable conditions for species [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], under the assumption that the speciesâ€™ ecological niche does not evolve to meet changing scenarios [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and that species' ranges are determined by climate [
