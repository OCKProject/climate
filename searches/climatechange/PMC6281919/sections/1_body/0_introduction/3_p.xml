 <xref rid="RSOS180513C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Their consequences remain highly uncertain due to severe threats from direct human exploitation (e.g. logging, agricultural expansion) and the indirect influence of human-accelerated environmental change. An improved understanding of the factors that affect species' distributions of tropical assemblages is necessary in order to contribute to the management and protection of these forests [
