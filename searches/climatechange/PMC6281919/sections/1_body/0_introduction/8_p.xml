<p class="p">The aim of this work is to estimate the short-term changes in the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> for the mid-late twenty-first century and assess local population vulnerabilities under plausible climatic scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Here we modelled two future (year 2050 and 2070) potential range of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> under contrasting emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, i.e. RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) based on 13 different available high-resolution Global Climate Models (GCMs). We discuss the results and potential long-term viability of the entire species and sampled populations along the range of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> using previously published genetic data in order to guide conservation actions of such ecologically relevant montane species.
