<p class="p">Tropical forests have shown a striking variability in their vulnerability to warming by climatic change [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Nonetheless, most such evidence comes from lowland tropical forests. Pessimistic models used realized thermal niches to predict strong impacts of warmer conditions without considering that upper thermal limits of the fundamental niches are mostly unknown. By contrast, more optimistic views suggest that evergreen lowland tropical forests are among the least vulnerable biomes to warming, given low absolute increases in temperature compared to upper thermal tolerance limits [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as available land area decreases with elevation [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Also, most predictions under climate change suggest a temperature increase and the displacement of the ‘equatorial limit’ of plant species towards higher, i.e. colder, latitudes [
