<p class="p">Heterogeneous conditions along speciesâ€™ ranges may result in locally adapted and thus genetically differentiated populations. Also among-population genetic divergence might be a consequence not only of differential selection pressures but also population isolation [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, under changing scenarios, modification of distribution ranges may significantly impact on species' gene pool and population long-term persistence. This may include the loss of unique genetic variants and/or genetic diversity due to bottlenecks or founder effects, as well as modification of gene flow rates or potential for adaptation, which should be taken into consideration in management and conservation plans.
