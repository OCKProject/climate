 <italic class="italic">Podocarpus parlatorei</italic> occurs in montane environments from 17 to 28° S latitude and elevations that vary from 1200 m.a.s.l. at its southern limit in Argentina to 3000 m.a.s.l. at its northern limit in Bolivia. It is considered a pioneer species, and abundant regeneration is associated with large-scale disturbances of anthropogenic and natural origin [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. At its southern limit, 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> generally occurs as pure forests, whereas in the north it grows underneath the canopy of 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus acuminata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cedrela angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Juglans australis</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It is wind-pollinated, and fruits are dispersed by gravity and/or zoochory ([
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]; R. Salinas, Environmental Secretary, Catamarca, Argentina, personal communication). The populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> are naturally disjunct and populations are ecologically subdivided into northern, central and southern sectors that are genetically divergent from one another as a result of historical isolation [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In Bolivia, it grows on the Peruano–Boliviano Yungas and continues to the south in Argentina, on the Boliviano–Tucumano formation [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Ecologically, 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> is a montane and relatively cold-tolerant taxon and thus it can be considered relatively sensitive to warming both due to adverse abiotic effects and poor competition with lowland trees [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Previous studies based on environmental niche models suggest that during cooling trends during the last glacial maximum 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> expanded its range towards eastern and southern lowlands compared with its present-day high-elevation distribution [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Its conservation status is near threatened [
 <xref rid="RSOS180513C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and is listed as CITES Appendix 1, which includes species with maximum risk of extinction (
