<p class="p">Mid-late twenty-first century climatic conditions for 2050 (mean of 2041–2060) and 2070 (mean of 2061–2080) were derived from 13 Global Climate Models (GCMs; electronic supplementary material, table S3) for two contrasting greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (IPCC, AR5). RCP2.6 assumes that global annual greenhouse gas emissions (measured in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-equivalents) peak during 2010–2020, with emissions declining substantially thereafter. Global temperature increase averages c. 1° by 2081–2100. In RCP8.5, emissions continue to rise throughout the twenty-first century and by 2081–2100 global temperature increase by 3.7°C [

 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> MaxEnt model was projected onto conditions predicted by each of the GCMs to obtain 13 models of predicted suitability for the species for 2050 and 2070. Ensemble models were calculated by averaging all model outputs to obtain a consensus species suitability during 2050 and 2070 for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.
