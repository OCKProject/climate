<p class="p">Because BIO
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> (precipitation of warmest quarter) and BIO
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (mean temperature of warmest quarter) were the bioclimatic variables with the highest contribution to the model (electronic supplementary material, table S2), we analysed for each of them the mean of 10 MaxEnt replicates univariate response curves and identified threshold conditions that defined optimum (mean probability of presence &gt;0.4) and suboptimum (mean probability of presence &lt;0.4). This generated range maps of dry (D), optimum (O) and wet (W) conditions for BIO
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> and cold (C), optimum (O) and hot (H) conditions for BIO
 <sub class="sub">10.</sub> We then generated classified maps of D, O, W and C, O, H for modern future (2070) RCP2.6 and 8.5 mean conditions (based on predictions of the 13 GCMs). These layers were cross-classified within ArcGis 10.2 to obtain modern-2070 (RCP2.6 and 8.5 transition maps of conditions for both bioclimatic variables).
