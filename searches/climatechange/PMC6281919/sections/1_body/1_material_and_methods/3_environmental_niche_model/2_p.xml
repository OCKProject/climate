 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> were used as training data over the entire current distribution of the species (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Potential modern distribution of the species was modelled using 10 000 background points. Background points were randomly placed across a rectangular area extending 13–29° S and 63–74° W using MaxEnt default procedure. A minimum set of current climate (1960–1990) variables at 30 arc-sec resolution (downloaded from WorldClim 1.4, 
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/current" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/current</uri>) were selected by jackknifing techniques that maximized regularized training gain (a measure of sample likelihood that describes how much better the MaxEnt distribution fits the presence data compared to a uniform distribution) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The final model included variables Bio
