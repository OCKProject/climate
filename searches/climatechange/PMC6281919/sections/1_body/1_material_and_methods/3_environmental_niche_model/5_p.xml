<p class="p">In order to estimate the possible fate of known 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> populations sampled for genetic analyses, we assigned to each of the 24 selected populations the corresponding state of BIO
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> and BIO
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>(D, O, C and C, O, H) for the modern and 2070 periods (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). For this, we calculated a 10 km buffer area (approx. 400 pixels) around each population coordinate and assigned the most frequent state (D, O, C and C, O, H) to each population.
