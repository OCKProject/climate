<p class="p">Contrary to our expectations of latitudinal and/or altitudinal range shifts our results show dramatic reductions in the overall bioclimatic suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">P. parlatorei</italic> across its entire range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS180513F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, figure S1). These reductions in suitability were more moderate for RCP2.6. Under this scenario, the central and northern populations retained a certain amount of suitability in 2050 and through 2070 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS180513F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>; electronic supplementary material, figure S1); however, the southern range of the species (population 21–24) becomes virtually unsuitable even by 2050. The scenario RCP8.5 shows a much stronger effect with overall strong reductions of suitability (
