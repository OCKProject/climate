Nineteen of the 24 populations are currently growing in optimal thermal conditions while the remaining five develop in hot environments. Of these 19, 8 (42%) are expected to become hot under the RCP2.6 scenario and 16 (84%) will do so under the RCP8.5 scenario while none will become cold. The remaining five (mostly northern) populations already in hot conditions under the current climate will remain under this condition in the future (
 <xref rid="RSOS180513TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>). Twenty-one of 24 populations currently develop in optimal rainfall levels while three thrive in dry conditions. Eighteen out of 21 populations (86%) currently in optimal rainfall levels will become dry under RCP2.6, whereas 12 (57%) will become dry under the RCP8.5 scenario. Of the three populations currently thriving in dry conditions, two (the northernmost and southernmost populations) will remain in the dry condition and one northerly population will reach optimal rainfall by 2070 (for both RCP2.6 and 8.5;

Of all populations remaining in the future in optimal thermal condition, none will remain in future optimal rainfall conditions. Likewise, none of the populations remaining or reaching optimal rainfall levels in the future will have corresponding optimal thermal conditions (
