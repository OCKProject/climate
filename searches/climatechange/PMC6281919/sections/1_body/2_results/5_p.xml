Many of these areas where aridification is expected to overlap with high-elevation areas, which in turn are expected to become thermally optimal, suggests a switch in the limiting factor that induces potential range retractions rather than shifts. On the other hand, some central and northern areas that are predicted to remain rainfall-wise optimal, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario (O─O, dark green in
