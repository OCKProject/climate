<p class="p">We predicted that species with long‐distance migrations would be less able to advance egg laying in response to earlier onset of summer, as these species use migration cues that are unrelated to climatic conditions on their breeding grounds (Both et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Jonzén et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Saino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Visser, Both, &amp; Lambrechts, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Additionally, the rigid schedules and the sheer distances long‐distance migrants travel may further constrain phenological advancement in these species (Helm, Gwinner, &amp; Trost, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In contrast, we predicted that short‐distance migrants would be better able to accurately time their nesting phenology, as their wintering site conditions are likely more indicative of conditions on their breeding grounds (Both et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Doxa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Jonzén et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Saino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Visser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In addition to distance, other factors such as location of wintering site, northbound migration route, and whether a species travels over land or water could also influence the ability of species to adjust egg laying, as these factors may influence the reliability of species to predict conditions on the breeding grounds during migration. In addition to changes in arrival dates, species may also be able to advance egg laying by reducing the time between arrival and egg laying (Visser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, as early‐nesting species may already be nesting as early as possible, we predicted that late‐nesting species would be better able to adjust egg laying in response to earlier onset of summer, assuming the period between arrival and breeding is longer than in early‐nesting species. Finally, we were unable to predict whether opportunistic or conservative species (Saalfeld &amp; Lanctot, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) would be better able to adjust egg laying, as both species exhibit traits that may enhance their ability to adjust to annual conditions. For example, opportunistic species may benefit by selecting favorable breeding locations on an annual basis, allowing them to adjust to annual climatic conditions (Kempenaers &amp; Valcu, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Lanctot &amp; Weatherhead, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Lanctot et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), while conservative species (that exhibit high site fidelity) may benefit by learning from the past experiences (Visser, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) or repairing with prior mates that would allow for earlier egg laying (Soikkeli, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1967</xref>; Jehl,
