<p class="p">From 2003 to 2016, shorebird nesting and snowmelt data were collected on eight 36‐ha plots near Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33517-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Plots were selected based on previous research activities in the area, accessibility from the road system, and suitable densities of shorebird nests. The eight plots reflected the general diversity of habitat types and species of shorebirds found nesting in the Utqiaġvik vicinity. Plots 1–3 were monitored in all 14 years; plots 4 and 6 were monitored only in 2003 and 2004, respectively; plots 5 and 7 were monitored from 2004 to 2016 (13 years) and 2005 to 2016 (12 years), respectively; and plot 0 was monitored from 2013 to 2016. We divided all plots into 144 quadrants (50 × 50 m) using wooden stakes placed every 50 m to facilitate data collection. Habitat within the study plots consisted mainly of tundra dominated by sedges, grasses, and moss interspersed with small ponds. This created a mosaic of low, wet marsh habitat and higher, well‐drained upland habitat (Brown, Everett, Webber, MacLean, &amp; Murray,
