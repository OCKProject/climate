<p class="p">Shorebird nests were located using single‐person area searches, two‐person rope drags, and opportunistically during most days between early June and early July (see Saalfeld &amp; Lanctot, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref> for description of methods and effort). We visited nests found with less than four eggs (modal clutch size for all species) daily until clutches were completed or until clutch size remained unchanged for two consecutive days. For clutches found during incubation, we floated 2–4 eggs to determine incubation stage (accuracy of which was typically within 4 days of the true hatch date; Liebezeit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). We estimated nest initiation dates (i.e., date first egg laid) for nests found during laying (14% of nests) by assuming one egg was laid per day, and for nests found during incubation by (1) subtracting a species’ incubation period (based on the Birds of North America accounts; Poole, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) from hatching dates for successful nests (59% of nests) or (2) using estimated development age based on flotation for unsuccessful nests (27% of nests). Our ability to find and estimate nest initiation dates for the majority of nests was likely enhanced by high nest survival rates in this region (Lanctot et al. unpublished data) due to an active fox removal program that was initiated in 2005 (Barto, Pratt, &amp; Sinnett,
