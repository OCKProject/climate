<p class="p">We estimated the percentage of snow cover within 36, 50 × 50 m quadrants equally spaced throughout each study plot to the nearest 5% every 2–5 days until ≤10% snow cover remained. We estimated the mean snow cover across all quadrants on each plot on a given date and then linearly regressed these values through time to determine the date when 20% snow cover was present on each plot in each year. We chose 20% as our cutoff value, as shorebirds begin initiating nests once enough snow‐free land is available (Grabowski et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Grabowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; but see Liebezeit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we chose 20%, as it could be calculated in most years. As the annual date for 20% snow cover was highly correlated (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>11) with the date of 50% snow cover for years when data were available, this particular cutoff value likely had little impact on our results. In both 2009 and 2016, snow cover was present, but &lt;20% on one plot during the first snow survey. Therefore, because winter winds keep snow from accumulating on the tundra and snow melts rapidly once temperatures reach 0°C, we used the date prior to the first survey as a conservative estimate of 20% snow cover for these plots. We also excluded nests on two plots lacking snowmelt information in 2004 when relating nest initiation dates to date of 20% snow cover.
