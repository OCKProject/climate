<p class="p">We captured adult shorebirds on nests using a modified luchock trap (or bow‐net; Priklonsky, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1960</xref>) and marked them with a US Geological Survey metal leg band, a unique combination of colored leg bands and a single dark green flag, uniquely engraved for a few species. We documented the return of individuals by capturing them or resighting them at nests, the latter usually at distances &lt;3 m from observers where bands could easily be seen. Our extensive nest searching and capture/resighting effort allowed us to document the return of individuals among years and whether individuals mated with a new or the same individual.
