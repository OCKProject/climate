<p class="p">For species that regularly returned to the study area to breed in successive years, we determined whether an individual tended to always nest at the same time within a calendar year by calculating the number of days between nesting attempts in different years. Next, we investigated how the timing of egg laying varied among individuals compared to within individuals for each species. To do this, we calculated the repeatability of laying dates between years for individuals following Lessells and Boag (
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>), in which variance components were calculated from the mean squares from an analysis of variance (PROC ANOVA; SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Repeatability (

These analyses were done for three species that each had ≥48 individuals observed for 2–9 years: Dunlin (
