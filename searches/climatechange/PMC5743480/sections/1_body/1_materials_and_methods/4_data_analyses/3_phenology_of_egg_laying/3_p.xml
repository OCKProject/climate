<p class="p">Because renesting can potentially bias our understanding of relationships between snowmelt and nest initiation, we removed all known renests occupied by individuals who had been identified with an earlier nest in the same season. Additionally, we repeated analyses after removing the last 25% of nests laid to assess the effect of including potential renests. We chose this approach because renests typically occur later in the season, but are difficult to document (Gates, Lanctot, &amp; Powell,
