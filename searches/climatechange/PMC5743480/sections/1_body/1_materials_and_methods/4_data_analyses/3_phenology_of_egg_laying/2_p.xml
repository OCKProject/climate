<p class="p">To determine the ability of shorebirds to adjust their timing of egg laying in response to variable snowmelt, we first determined if nest initiation dates were influenced by timing of snowmelt by relating individual nest initiation dates to date of 20% snow cover using a general linear mixed model with plot as a random effect. Next, we determined whether shorebirds have advanced their laying dates over the 14‐year study by relating nest initiation dates to year using a general linear mixed model with plot as a random effect. These and all subsequent analyses were conducted separately for each species after removing years with inadequate sample sizes (i.e., &lt;5 nests per year).</p>
