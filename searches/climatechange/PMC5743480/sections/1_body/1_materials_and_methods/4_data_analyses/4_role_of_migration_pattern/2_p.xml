<p class="p">We determined whether wintering location, migration pattern (distance and migration route), timing of nesting (mean nest initiation dates), or settlement strategy (conservative or opportunistic) was related to a species’ ability to respond to changing snowmelt conditions by qualitatively comparing the slope parameter from the regression of nest initiation date and date of 20% snowmelt among species with differing life‐history characteristics (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33517-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). We chose to use this relationship, instead of the relationship with year, as not all species had sufficient data in all years, potentially biasing comparisons. All species, however, were observed for the entire range of snowmelt conditions (e.g., data were available from both early and late snowmelt years).
