<p class="p">To control for spatial variation in snow accumulation and melt, we used snowmelt measurements recorded at the plot level within each year for all analyses. We assessed the level of annual variability in timing of snowmelt by documenting changes in the mean date of 20% snow cover within plots among years. Additionally, we determined if timing of snowmelt advanced in the past 14Â years by relating the date of 20% snow cover within plots to year using a general linear mixed model with plot as a random effect (PROC MIXED with standard variance components; SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>
