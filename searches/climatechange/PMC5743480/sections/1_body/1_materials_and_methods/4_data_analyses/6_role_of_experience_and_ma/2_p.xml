<p class="p">To determine if individuals learned from past nesting experiences, we investigated whether individuals adjusted their date of nest initiation relative to when they nested in their first year. To do this, we related the difference between laying date and date of 20% snow cover in the initial capture year to the difference in the following year using a general linear model (PROC GLM; SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We expected individuals that nested too early (e.g., before snow had melted) in their initial year to adjust their laying dates to be later in their second year and vice versa. These analyses were restricted to the three species (i.e., Dunlin, Semipalmated Sandpiper, and Red Phalarope) with adequate return rates (see above).</p>
