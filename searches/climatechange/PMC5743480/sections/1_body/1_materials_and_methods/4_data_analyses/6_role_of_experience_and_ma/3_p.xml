<p class="p">Next, we determined whether mate fidelity affected an individual's date of egg laying by comparing differences between nest initiation dates and date of 20% snow cover for individuals that nested with the same mate versus individuals that nested with a new mate using an analysis of variance. Here, we restricted analyses to individuals observed in both their initial capture year and the year after and for which their mate was identified in both years. We categorized nests in the following year as either exhibiting mate fidelity (i.e., nests with both members of the original pair) or not (i.e., nests with one member of the original pair, but a new mate). These analyses were restricted to biparental incubators with adequate return rates (i.e., Dunlin and Semipalmated Sandpiper). Given low sample sizes and the insignificance of sex above, we combined information for both sexes in these analyses.</p>
