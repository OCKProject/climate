<p class="p">Regardless of migration route, the date when species first arrive on the breeding grounds relative to the start of egg laying may constrain a species’ ability to advance their nesting phenology. Indeed, the two species (i.e., Dunlin and Semipalmated Sandpiper) that nested the earliest on our study plots also responded the least to timing of snowmelt. Although we do not have exact arrival dates of species investigated in this study, it seems likely that these species are already nesting as early as possible given current arrival dates. For example, it was estimated that, on average, Dunlin is currently nesting just 4–7 days after arrival (Doll,
