<p class="p">In addition to timing of egg laying, settlement strategy may also influence a species’ ability to advance nesting phenology, with species exhibiting an opportunistic settlement strategy potentially more likely to respond to changing snowmelt conditions than species with a conservative strategy. This may be due to the ability of opportunistic species to travel across large portions of their breeding range while assessing breeding site conditions and ultimately making adjustments in timing that conservative species may be unable to achieve (Kempenaers &amp; Valcu,

 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The highly variable conditions at Utqiaġvik (e.g., mean annual snowmelt ranged from 28 May to 16 June) may limit the ability of conservative species to use the past experiences to react to future conditions. Surprisingly, even the additional benefits from repairing with the same mate did not allow conservative species to adjust adequately, although repairing with the same mate did result in slightly earlier egg laying dates, although not significantly. Western Sandpipers, however, did not follow this general trend, with this species exhibiting the greatest response to timing of snowmelt despite having both conservative and opportunistic traits. Why this species did not conform to the general pattern is unclear but could be due to this species being on the fringe of its breeding range in Utqiaġvik with numbers increasing since 2008. Therefore, changes to the population occurring at the same time as changes in snowmelt conditions may have confounded our results. More work, however, is needed to tease apart these potentially confounding factors and to verify the qualitative analyses conducted here.
