<p class="p">The current inability of many species to keep pace with earlier summers in the Arctic is likely to have profound impacts on these species. This is because delayed nesting (relative to snowmelt) decreases the probability of hatching during peak insect emergence (Saalfeld et al. unpublished data), ultimately resulting in reduced juvenile growth and survival rates (Schekkerman et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Saalfeld et al. unpublished data). Further, delayed nesting reduces the time available for adults to renest should their first nest fail (Gates et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), for adults to rebuild body reserves lost due to egg laying and incubation duties, and for adults and chicks to acquire sufficient reserves for earlier and successful southbound migration (Meltofte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Taylor, Lanctot, Powell, Kendall, &amp; Nigro, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Tulp &amp; Schekkerman, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Earlier and warmer summers, however, are just one way climate change is affecting arctic‐breeding shorebirds. Climate change is also changing or projected to change the extent, quality, and location of breeding locations (Wauchope et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). As a result, migratory birds may need to fly longer distances or switch migratory routes to reach suitable breeding habitats; both of which, along with continual threats to wintering and migratory stop‐over locations, may result in the inability of species to accurately time phenology on the breeding grounds. Therefore, continuing to understand species‐specific adaptability remains important for determining the potential long‐term impacts under future climate change scenarios.
