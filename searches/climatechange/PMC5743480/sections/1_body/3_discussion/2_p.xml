<p class="p">By the end of the century (i.e., 2100), climate change is predicted to advance the onset of summer by 8–11 days throughout the Arctic (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, at our study site in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, snowmelt is already occurring 11 days earlier than just 14 years ago (0.8 days/year). This rate is much faster than that estimated for the previous six decades in this region (0.13 days/year from 1940 to 2000; Stone, Dutton, Harris, &amp; Longenecker, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). However, it should be noted that while we have one of the longest continuous datasets on shorebird nesting phenology, the time span of this analysis was still relatively short (14 years) in comparison with decades or century‐long climatic change predictions. In addition, our results may have been heavily influenced by conditions in the past few years (e.g., the last 2 years with extremely early snowmelt). Nonetheless, this drastic change in the start of summer is likely to have large consequences on the species inhabiting this region, especially migratory birds that may be especially vulnerable to phenological mismatch. As predicted, shorebirds in this study responded to earlier snowmelt by advancing nesting phenology (varying among species from 0.1–0.9 days earlier per year), although no species appeared capable of keeping pace with advancing snowmelt.
