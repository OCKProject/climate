<p class="p">Previous studies have suggested that differences in adaptability among species may occur due to the variation in migration strategies (Both et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, we found little commonality in migration patterns among species with similar adaptation abilities. One potential reason for this may be due to the sheer distances all species traveled between wintering and arctic‐breeding grounds, with even the shortest distance migrants traveling thousands of kilometers to winter in southern North America. Therefore, conditions experienced on wintering grounds, even for the shortest distance migrants, were likely unrelated to conditions in the Arctic, impeding the ability of any species to adjust departure times based on annual conditions. Migration route similarly did not appear to impact the ability of species to advance laying dates. Adjusting migration timing to breeding site conditions, however, is only possible if conditions experienced during migration are correlated with conditions on the breeding grounds, and species are able to alter migration speed (Ely, McCaffery, &amp; Gill, 
 <xref rid="ece33517-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">in press</xref>). However, our assessments of the effects of migration patterns on nest initiation timing were quite coarse; more information is needed on specific migratory routes and stop‐over locations and durations used by species to assess how environmental factors at staging and breeding sites influence the ability of species to adapt to earlier summers.
