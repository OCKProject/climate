<p class="p">We found that six of the eight shorebird species exhibited phenological advancement in laying dates (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33517-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), although no species appeared fully capable of advancing egg laying to keep pace with advancing snowmelt (i.e., all slopes significantly &lt;1; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33517-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Species that appeared most responsive to timing of snowmelt included Western Sandpiper (

 <italic class="italic">Calidris melanotos</italic>), and Red Phalarope, with slope parameters ranging from 0.44 to 0.55; all other species had slopes &lt;0.4 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33517-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These trends remained consistent when comparing advancement rates, with Western Sandpiper, Pectoral Sandpiper, and Red Phalarope advancing egg laying by 0.34–0.98 days/year, while all other species advanced laying dates by &lt;0.3 days/year (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33517-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). American Golden‐Plover (
 <italic class="italic">Pluvialis dominica</italic>) and Red‐necked Phalarope (
 <italic class="italic">Phalaropus lobatus</italic>) showed no significant advancement, although low sample sizes of these species may have reduced our ability to document advancement.
