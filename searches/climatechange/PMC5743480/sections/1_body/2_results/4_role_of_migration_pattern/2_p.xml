<p class="p">Little commonality existed in wintering location and migration strategies among species with similar responses to timing of snowmelt (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33517-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). However, we did find that species exhibiting an opportunistic settlement strategy (e.g., Pectoral Sandpiper and Red Phalarope) were more likely to respond to changing snowmelt conditions (i.e., larger slope parameters) as compared to species with a conservative settlement strategy (e.g., Dunlin and Semipalmated Sandpiper), while species exhibiting traits of both settlement strategies exhibited moderate response rates (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33517-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). This pattern, however, did not hold for Western Sandpiper which exhibited the highest response rate of all species, but exhibited traits of both settlement strategies (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33517-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, we found that species that historically nested the earliest (i.e., Dunlin and Semipalmated Sandpiper) also exhibited the lowest response rates as compared to later nesting species; however, as timing of nesting was correlated with settlement strategy, we were unable to differentiate which of these two life‐history characteristics was more important (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33517-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>).
