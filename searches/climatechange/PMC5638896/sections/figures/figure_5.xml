  <p class="p">Changes in DOM darkness in the Manitowoc River and Lake Michigan during 2011. Darkness is expressed as DOC-specific absorbance at 305â€‰nm. Note the strong increase in color that, along with increases in DOC concentration, contributed to the decrease in SIP during the period of rain in June before day 180. This was followed by a summer-long decrease in darkness due to decreases in terrestrial DOM inputs and photobleaching of the DOM by sunlight. Manitowoc River at the U.S. Geological Survey gage station and Lake Michigan, Red Arrow Beach.</p>
