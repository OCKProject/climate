  <p class="p">Changes in modeled depth of survival for the human pathogen 
   <italic class="italic">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> as a function of DOM concentration (as dissolved organic carbon, DOC). The 24 h survival is the percent inactivation in 24 h by solar UV-B near summer solstice. Data are from nine of the ten study lakes and sites in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; Negra is missing due to the lack of DOM data. In the clearest, lowest DOM lakes high inactivation can occur even at depths of greater than 10 m, while at higher DOM concentrations inactivation depths decrease to a fraction of a meter. Note the variable response to DOM concentration which is due largely to variations in DOM quality (darkness, DOC-specific absorbance) among lakes. Less UV-sensitive pathogens will have correspondingly shallower inactivation depths, with the most UV-resistant species such as adenovirus not even being susceptible to solar UV inactivation at the surface of a lake within a single day.
