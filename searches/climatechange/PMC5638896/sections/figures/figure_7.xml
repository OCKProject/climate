  <p class="p">Global climatology of daily SIP at Earth’s surface. This was calculated with an atmospheric radiative transfer model using as input daily ozone column and climatological cloud data observed by satellites during 1990–2000. Computed spectral irradiances were weighted by the DNA action spectrum and integrated over 24 hours, to yield the daily doses that are used here as a proxy for SIP at the Earth’s surface (above the water surface). Maps were developed with IDL Version 8.4 (linux × 86_64 m64). (c) 2014, Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Inc. (
