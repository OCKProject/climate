  <p class="p">Browning-induced reductions in UV transparency in Lake Giles, northeastern Pennsylvania, USA. Long-term increases in DOM and decreases in UV transparency (depth to which 1% of subsurface 320 nm penetrates) related to browning of this and other lakes in the northeastern USA have corresponded closely with a two-fold or greater reduction in SIP (see Fig.
