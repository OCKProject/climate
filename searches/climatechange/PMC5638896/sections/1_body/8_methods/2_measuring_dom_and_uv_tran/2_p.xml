 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) Red Arrow beach was sampled on Sundays, Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays from June 3, 2011 to September 5, 2011. The four river sites were sampled from June 4, 2011 to September 1, 2011. At three of the river sites, each sample used for our measurements was a composite of six subsamples (each 290 ml) taken from the stream’s thalweg using a Niskin sampler. At the 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> St. Bridge Manitowoc River site (river mouth), twenty sub-samples (each 75 ml) were composited to create one 1800 ml sample. All samples were prepared for UV-visible, and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), measurements within 6 hours of collection. At Red Arrow beach, water samples were obtained from Lake Michigan for UV-visible spectral measurements and DOC analysis using Total Organic Carbon (TOC) certified amber glass bottles with Teflon lined caps (Scientific Products) at depths that were 0.15–0.20 m below the water’s surface in water that was 0.5 m deep. Other water samples for microbial analysis were collected as described in Section 9060 of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (1999) 0.15–0.20 m below the water’s surface in water that was 0.5 m deep, using sterile polyethylene terephthalate bottles (Idexx).
