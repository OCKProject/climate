<p id="Par27" class="p">These Manitowoc region water samples were prepared for UV/visible spectral measurements and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis by filtering each water sample through a 0.2 µm polycarbonate Millipore filter within 6 hours of collection. The filtrates were stored in TOC approved bottles at 4 °C until analysis. UV-visible absorption spectra of the water samples were determined using a Perkin-Elmer LAMBDA
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> 35 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer. Measured absorbances (A
 <sub class="sub">λ</sub>) in the UV-visible spectra were used to calculate absorption coefficients (i.e.,
