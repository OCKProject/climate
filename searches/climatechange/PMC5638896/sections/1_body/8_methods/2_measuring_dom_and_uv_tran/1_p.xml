 </sup>. Water samples were collected in the surface waters of lakes with a Van Dorn bottle and spectral scans carried out on GF/F-filtered subsamples in a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOC-5000 or TOC-V

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> potassium biphthalate). Dissolved absorbance was obtained from GF/F-filtered samples with a Shimadzu UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-160U, UV-1601, or UV-1650). Raw absorbance values were corrected by subtracting the average absorbance of a Milli-Q water blank between 775–800 nm and calculating Naperian dissolved absorption coefficients
