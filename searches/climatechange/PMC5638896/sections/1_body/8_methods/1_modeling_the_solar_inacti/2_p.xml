<p id="Par22" class="p">In-water radiation was computed from the incident atmospheric radiation by applying Snell refraction and Fresnel reflection (for unpolarized light) at the air water interface, and Beer-Lambert propagation to depths below the surface. For the direct beam, the entry and propagation geometry is straightforward because the angle of incidence at the air-water interface equals the solar zenith angle. Diffuse radiation (which frequently exceeds the direct solar beam at UV wavelengths) was assumed to be hemispherically isotropic, and was subdivided into N angular sectors of equal area measured from the zenith (cosine-weighted), so that each of the N beamlets had its own angle of incidence in air, and then (through Snell’s law) its own angle under water. The total irradiance at any depth was computed by summing the contributions from the direct beam and the N diffuse beamlets, each component having experienced a slightly different propagation angle and thus slightly different Beer-Lambert attenuation. Typically, N = 10 was used, with no significant improvement from finer subdivisions.</p>
