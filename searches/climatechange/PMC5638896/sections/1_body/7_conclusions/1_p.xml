<p id="Par20" class="p">The spectral absorbance data on natural water bodies and modeling of SIP presented here extend previous studies by demonstrating the potential for precipitation to elevate DOM concentrations in inland and coastal waters, thus decreasing the potential for solar UV radiation to inactivate pathogens. This study is a first step and further empirical surveys and experimental studies are needed to confirm the importance of solar UV inactivation relative to other environmental controls of pathogen abundance. Environmental data collected under natural solar radiation conditions that include spectral attenuation in the water column across environmental gradients of temperature, pH, and other important regulators of pathogen survival are necessary to identify the complex interactions that will ultimately regulate pathogen abundance in surface waters. Studies of species-specific variations in pathogen susceptibility to solar UV damage as well as repair mechanisms will also be essential to estimating the importance of SIP relative to other environmental controls of waterborne diseases of humans and wildlife.</p>
