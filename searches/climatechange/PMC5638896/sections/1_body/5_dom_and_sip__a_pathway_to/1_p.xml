  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>
 </sup>. Our modelling suggests that increased DOM and reduced SIP will contribute to increased pathogen survival following heavy precipitation. In many cases, increases in infectious diseases are associated with lower water clarity as well as increased runoff, even in areas with advanced drinking water treatment
