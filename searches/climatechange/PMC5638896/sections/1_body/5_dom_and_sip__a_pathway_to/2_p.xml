 </sup>. Field incubation experiments that manipulated solar UV in two lakes revealed substantially higher infection prevalence in treatments shielded from natural solar radiation. In lakes with lower DOM concentrations, fungal epidemics started later in the year (when incident sunlight was reduced) and were smaller in magnitude.
