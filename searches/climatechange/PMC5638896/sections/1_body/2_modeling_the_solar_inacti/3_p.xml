<p id="Par9" class="p">The clarity of inland waters and thus the potential for solar inactivation of waterborne pathogens varies greatly over space and time. For example, 1% of incident 320 nm UV reaches depths of tens of meters in some of the most transparent lakes and drinking water reservoirs in the world, but only a few centimeters in less transparent lakes

 </sup>. DOM and other dissolved and particulate compounds reduce water transparency and thus exposure to disinfecting solar UV as well. Modelling the SIP for lakes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for which we have water transparency data reveal strong differences over space and time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). SIP can be reduced by an order of magnitude due to (1) increases in sun angle related to time of year, (2) the lower water transparency in some lakes vs. others, and (3) reduced water transparency in nearshore vs. offshore sites in Lake Tahoe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The nearshore habitats of Lake Tahoe where SIP is low, are also where human use is high, and water intakes are located
