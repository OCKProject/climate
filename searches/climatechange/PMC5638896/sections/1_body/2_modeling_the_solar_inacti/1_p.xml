<p id="Par7" class="p">The UV spectrum can be divided into UV-A (315–400 nm), UV-B (280–315 nm) and UV-C (200–280 nm) wavebands. While germicidal lamps for disinfection use primarily the short wavelength, high energy UV-C radiation, here we focus on the inactivating effects of natural solar radiation. Ozone in the stratosphere prevents any UV-C from reaching Earth’s surface and removes most of the solar UV-B, particularly wavelengths shorter than about 295 nm. But the longer wavelength UV-B that reaches Earth’s surface is still potent enough to induce damage to DNA as well as other cellular components
