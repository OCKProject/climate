<p id="Par8" class="p">Quantifying the effects of solar UV on pathogens in aquatic environments requires knowledge of (1) the number of photons and spectral composition (how many photons at each wavelength) of the UV reaching the surface of the water, (2) the transparency of the water to UV, including spectral absorption, and (3) the spectral sensitivity of the pathogen, referred to as an action spectrum or biological weighting function. The indirect effects of UV (e.g. by producing reactive oxygen species, ROS, such as singlet oxygen, especially in the UV-A region) may also play an important role in disinfection

For the underwater estimates for waterborne pathogens we average this over the top 1 meter depth since these surface waters are where humans, wildlife, and many aquatic organisms are likely to have the most exposure. We estimated SIP using the biologically active UV-B reaching the water surface and penetrating into the water using the Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV, version 5.3) model

 </sup>. The sensitivity of different pathogens to UV-C in germicidal lamps has been more extensively investigated than that for solar UV-B. Therefore, as a first order estimate, we used available data on UV-C inactivation and the DNA action spectrum to estimate the SIP of several pathogens and indicator species for natural solar radiation (Table
