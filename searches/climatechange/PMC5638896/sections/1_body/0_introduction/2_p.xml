 </sup>. Here we explore a previously suggested but largely unrecognized mechanism through which heavy precipitation may increase waterborne pathogens. This mechanism involves increases in terrestrially-derived DOM that reduce penetration of solar UV in surface waters

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. DOM strongly and selectively absorbs the shorter wavelength UV in sunlight, thus reducing the potential for solar UV to inactivate waterborne pathogens

 </sup>. Although the ability of solar UV to inactivate waterborne pathogens has long been recognized, the importance of this nexus of precipitation and DOM-mediated reductions in water transparency and solar UV inactivation of pathogens has not previously been quantified. Here we examine the evidence for this link by first highlighting recent literature on the sensitivity of waterborne pathogens to the UV in natural sunlight. We then quantitatively assess the potential for natural variations in incident sunlight and water transparency to alter inactivation of various pathogens. We present a case study from Lake Michigan that demonstrates the effects of storm events on the potential for solar disinfection, and discuss the implications of changes in UV exposure in inland and coastal waters for waterborne pathogens and the spread of infectious disease globally.
