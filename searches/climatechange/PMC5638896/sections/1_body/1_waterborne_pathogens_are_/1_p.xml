 </sup>. The ability of solar UV-B radiation to inactivate bacteria in natural oceanic waters and the reduction of this solar inactivation potential in waters with reduced transparency has also been documented

 </sup>. Collectively these data provide strong evidence for the potential of sunlight to inactivate pathogens in natural surface waters including coastal and inland waters on which humans and wildlife are heavily dependent.
