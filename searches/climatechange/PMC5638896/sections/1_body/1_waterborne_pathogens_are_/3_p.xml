 <italic class="italic">Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> is a common and widespread contaminant in surface waters and an indicator species for protozoan pathogens in drinking water. It causes cryptosporidiosis that can lead to chronic illness and even death in children, the elderly, and the immune-compromised. Infectious oocysts of

 <italic class="italic">parvum</italic> are spread primarily by faecal-oral contact by humans and livestock. The oocysts are resistant to chlorination, but natural solar UV substantially reduces (ten fold or greater) their

In this latter study, natural waters with higher DOM concentrations reduced this solar UV inactivation, with the extent of the inactivation depending on the source water and DOM concentration. Effective inactivation by sunlight has also been demonstrated in a variety of non-human waterborne pathogens including those that infect lizards
