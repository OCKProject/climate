<p id="Par18" class="p">Several factors may lead our model to underestimate SIP. First, we estimate SIP for only the top 1 meter of surface waters, while in very clear systems UV-B may penetrate deep enough for substantial SIP at depths deeper than 1 m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). This may lead to an underestimate of the effects of DOM on SIP. Second, the model uses only dissolved absorption coefficients, and yet there are many systems such as rivers and shallow reservoirs where inorganic particulates may account for a substantial portion of light attenuation in the water column. Third, nutrient pollution or climate warming may enhance algal growth, and blooms of filamentous algae such as

 </sup>. Fourth, our analysis is based on DNA damage by the UV-B component of the solar spectrum, but UV-A may also play an important role in solar inactivation of pathogens. While DOM attenuates UV-B most strongly, it also attenuates UV-A, which produces ROS such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, that have been shown to inactivate pathogens due to damage to cell components other than DNA

 </sup>. In some cases, the inactivation of viruses by sunlight may be greater in the presence of DOM than in its absence if the photoproducts increase virus inactivation more than the DOM reduces exposure to UV damage

 </sup>. Species-specific UV tolerance and environmental factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and ionic composition of the water also need to be considered

 </sup>. Oxygen depletion and pH may be particularly important in waste stabilization ponds where dissolved oxygen can be rapidly depleted and pH can exceed 8.5

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>

 </sup>, photoenzymatic repair of UV-damaged DNA is also dependent upon longer wavelength UV-A and visible light
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>
 </sup>, and may consequently reduce SIP, especially at sub-lethal levels of UV exposure. The presence or absence of photoenzymatic repair and variation in its spectral dependence among pathogen species as well as the attenuation of these longer wavelengths by DOM are also important processes that will influence SIP, and need to be explored further.
