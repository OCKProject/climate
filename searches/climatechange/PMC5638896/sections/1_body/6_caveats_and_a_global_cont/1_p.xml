<p id="Par17" class="p">The abundance of waterborne pathogens is regulated by multiple factors, and many of the environmental controls are system- and pathogen-specific. Several useful models that simulate the effects of natural sunlight and multiple other factors that control water-borne pathogens have been developed

 </sup> are increasing our ability to quantitatively estimate how variations in DOM reduce solar UV disinfection. Our UV absorbance data from a wide variety of inland surface waters and modeling of SIP suggest that widespread reductions in water transparency are reducing the SIP for waterborne pathogens over space and time. In addition to DOM concentration, DOM quality (darkness) is critical to determining UV absorbance and thus SIP of pathogens. For example, if we use the absorbance spectra that are the basis for estimating SIP in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> to plot the depth of different levels of solar inactivation of 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptospordium parvum</italic> as a function of DOM concentration, we find an increasingly shallower depth for a given level of pathogen inactivation with increasing DOM concentration (as dissolved organic carbon, DOC, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). These inactivation depths vary over two orders of magnitude due to differences in DOM concentration. The scatter apparent in this relationship is due to variation in the UV absorbing capacity (DOC-specific absorbance, or “darkness”) of the DOM among lakes, or even within lakes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Variations in DOM quantity and quality are due largely to differences in hydrology, weather conditions, and climate in the given region
