<p id="Par10" class="p">One of the strongest signals of changing water clarity in inland waters in recent decades is the doubling of the concentrations of DOM in regions of northeastern North America and northern Europe
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>. This phenomenon, known as browning, can substantially reduce water clarity on time scales ranging from individual storm events to seasonal, inter-annual, and inter-decadal time periods
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. The causes of browning are multiple and include recovery from acidification

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>, and increased precipitation related to climate change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. The increases in the quantity as well as darker color of terrestrially-derived DOM associated with browning result in greatly increased absorption of UV and reduce SIP, fostering increased survival of waterborne pathogens. For example, long-term increases in DOM and reductions in UV transparency in Lake Giles in northeastern North America

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup> have been very closely correlated over time in recent decades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and translate to a two-fold reduction in SIP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
