<p id="Par11" class="p">The penetration of UV into water bodies is controlled in large part by input of terrestrially-derived DOM to surface waters

 </sup> and therefore by precipitation and hydrologic conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. Increases in precipitation lead to water-saturated wetlands and soils with lower oxygen that produce greater amounts of DOM, ultimately transported by increased runoff to rivers, lakes, and coastal oceans. This leads to higher concentrations of DOM and reduced UV transparency

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. In regions such as the northeastern USA, extreme precipitation events have increased by as much as 71% between 1958 and 2012
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. These extreme precipitation events can induce abrupt reductions in water clarity due to increased inputs of both dissolved and particulate substances to inland waters
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. Extreme storm events contribute a major portion of the annual DOM flux from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. For example, a single hurricane event in 2011 (Irene) contributed 19% of the 2011 annual DOM exports from a forested catchment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. Space-for-time modeling based on data from over 1,000 boreal lakes in Norway indicate that future increases in air temperature and precipitation will increase DOM concentrations by as much as 65% in surface waters
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. Modeling of carbon flux from the Mississippi River basin to the Gulf of Mexico from 2001–2010 showed that DOM export was approximately 30% higher during a wet year and 30% lower during a dry year compared to the average during the study period
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. Modeling studies that focus on hydrologic changes and hold other factors such as land use change constant have estimated an increase in annual DOM export into the Gulf of Maine of up to 40–50% or more in some rivers from 1930 to 2013
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>. Most of this increase was during the fall and winter when sunlight for solar disinfection is low. The increase in DOM combined with seasonal decreases in incident solar radiation during the fall and winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) will accentuate the reduction in SIP in coastal receiving waters during these periods. Indonesian rivers in peatland-dominated landscapes that drain into coastal oceans deliver twice the discharge volume and higher DOM concentrations during the wet season (35 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) compared to the dry season (28 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
