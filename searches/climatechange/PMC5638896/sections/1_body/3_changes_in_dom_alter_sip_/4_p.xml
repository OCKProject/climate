<p id="Par13" class="p">While climate change is leading some regions to experience greater precipitation and heavier precipitation events, in regions such as the western USA, drought conditions have become prevalent in many recent years. Drought conditions increase water clarity and thus UV exposure in clear-water lakes

 </sup>. Drought reduces the dissolved and particulate matter that is washed into inland and coastal waters, and increases water residence times, thus prolonging exposure to degradation of DOM by sunlight

 </sup>. This greater water transparency may in turn lead to higher SIP in the affected surface waters. Adequate spectral absorbance and DOM data necessary to thoroughly explore the impact of warm, dry conditions on SIP are not available. However, two lines of evidence support an increase in SIP during warm, dry conditions such as drought. First, DOM output from rivers is lower in dry vs. wet seasons or years as discussed in the references above. Second, in the case study reported below, we show how the warm, dry summer periods are periods of increased water clarity and SIP.
