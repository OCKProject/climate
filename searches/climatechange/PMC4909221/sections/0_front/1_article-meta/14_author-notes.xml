   <bold class="bold">Competing Interests: </bold>ALCUE-Net and BiodivERsA are initiatives gathering programmers and funders of research in many domains, including the biodiversity and climate change interface. ALCUE-Net is promoting collaboration between Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean for environmental sciences, while BiodivERsA is promoting pan-European research on biodiversity, including its international competitiveness and visibility. This requires mapping activities such as the bibliographic analysis made in the current study. This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
