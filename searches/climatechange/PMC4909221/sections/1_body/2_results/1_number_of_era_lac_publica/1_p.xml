<p class="p">The number of peer-reviewed publications that arose from collaborations between ERA and LAC countries on biodiversity, climate change and at the interface of biodiversity and climate change all increased exponentially between 2003 and 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157441.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>), with the highest exponential coefficients for the biodiversity/climate change interface (biodiversity/climate change = 0.28; climate change = 0.22; biodiversity = 0.15). As a control trend, the exponential coefficient for the publication number between ERA and LAC on all topics other than biodiversity and climate change was only of 0.087 during the same period. The total number of ERA-LAC co-publications at the interface of biodiversity and climate change between 2003 and 2013 was 500. The proportion of publications corresponding to this interface as compared to the sum of publications on ‘biodiversity’ plus ‘climate change’ increased 3-fold over the last decade from 2.2% to 6.9% (significant linear increase, R2 = 0.81, p &lt; 0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157441.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). In parallel, a 8-fold increase was observed for the proportion of publications on the biodiversity/climate change interface regarding the sum of publications on all other topics (dash line, R2 = 0.92, p &lt; 0.01,
