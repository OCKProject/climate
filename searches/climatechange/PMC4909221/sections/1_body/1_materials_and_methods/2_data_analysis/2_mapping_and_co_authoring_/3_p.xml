<p class="p">We computed two indicators to evaluate the role of each country within the ERA-LAC co-publication network [
 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]: (i) the scientific production level, i.e. the number of publications produced, normalized by the maximum number observed, and (ii) the betweenness centrality, normalized by the maximum value observed, which indicates how strongly a country acts as a bridge with other countries in the ERA-LAC network. Centrality indices are essential tools for the analysis of networks as they are designed to rank the actors (e.g., countries) according to their position in the network, which can be viewed as the prominence of actors embedded in a network structure. Most centrality indices are based on shortest paths linking pairs of actors, measuring, e.g., the average distance from other actors, or the ratio of shortest paths an actor lies on. Following [
 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], publication networks can be described as a graph G = (V, E), where the set V of vertices represents countries of all authors in the publications, and the set E of edges represents links between countries. We can define a path from s ∈ V to t ∈ V as a sequence of vertices and edges, beginning with s and ending with t, such that each edge connects its preceding with its succeeding vertex. The length of a path is the sum of the weights of its edges. Let σ
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> denote the number of shortest paths from s to t, where σ
 <sub class="sub">ss</sub> = 1 by convention. Let σ
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> (υ) denote the number of shortest paths from s to t that some υ ∈ V lies on. The betweeness centrality C
 <sub class="sub">B</sub>(υ) of each country can be calculated as (
