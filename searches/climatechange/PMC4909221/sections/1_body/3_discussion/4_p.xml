While no individual ERA country reached levels of co-authorship like that between the United States of America and LAC, the ERA as a whole equalled North Americaâ€™s level of scientific partnerships with LAC. This pattern probably illustrates comparable economic units and funding flows between North America/ERA and LAC [
