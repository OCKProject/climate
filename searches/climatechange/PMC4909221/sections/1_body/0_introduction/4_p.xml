<p class="p">However, it is not clear how these European, trans-continental and bilateral research programmes impact scientific cooperation at the interface of biodiversity and climate change. Political leaders in the European Union (EU) and in LAC have long recognised the importance of incorporating scientific knowledge into proposed solutions to the increasingly complex challenges that biodiversity loss and climate change pose to society at both local and global scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. More knowledge-based solutions to these challenges are needed with the recent creation of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the debates associated with the December 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21), and the need for the European Research Area (ERA) to explore nature-based solutions [

 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. ERA and LAC countries together host a great proportion of the worldâ€™s biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, cooperation at the interface of biodiversity and climate change should interest both, and demand holistic and regional approaches. But the outcome of the different research programmes developed for promoting ERA-LAC research collaboration remains to be evaluated, in particular for hot topics like the interactions between biodiversity and climate change.
