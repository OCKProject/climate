 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, both issues are particularly complex, and addressing them requires skills and research inputs that span countries and disciplines [
 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Interdisciplinary teams have largely been promoted by funding programmes that direct research to development and politically desired goals [
 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Though collaborative research teams are common in studies of global, multi-faceted problems, international interdisciplinary research networks are not easy to build [
 <xref rid="pone.0157441.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In particular, creating an effective international, interdisciplinary team is not as simple as bringing together a group of scientists from different disciplines and countries. It requires the development of common research languages, methods and models across both team members and countries [
