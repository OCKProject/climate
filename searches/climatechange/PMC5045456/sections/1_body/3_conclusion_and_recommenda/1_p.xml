 <italic class="italic">Tembien</italic> suggest that more than 96 % of local farmers were able to perceive the adverse effects of climate change. They apparently noticed that climate change drastically reduced the amount of rainfall, which evidently exhibited in terms of occurrence of frequent drought with its immediate consequences on loss of their livestock and crop productivity. In the due course of responding the negative effects of climate change, producers of small ruminants continued to pursue multiple adaptation methods. Field -based assessments on indicators of multiple adaptation choices were conducted and the estimated results indicated that nearly 96 % of the farmers were found to use marketing. During drought periods, farmers used to sell their livestock because of fear of lack of natural grazing and animal feed.
