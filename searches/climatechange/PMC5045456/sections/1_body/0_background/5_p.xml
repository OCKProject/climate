<p class="p">Adaptation therefore remains one of the policy options to address climatic challenges prevailed on the livestock sector such as on sheep and goats (Deressa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2008</xref>; Di Faclo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>). This has great relevance for developing countries seeking to maintain food security if it is focused to go hand-in-hand with the long-term policy priority among poor farmers (Di Faclo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>; Tubiello 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2012</xref>). Their decision to adapt to climate change depends on socio-economic and environmental factors (Taruvinga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2013</xref>). Obviously, farmers with the low capacity to adapt are generally the most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate variability and change. Within the spectrum of livestock versus adaptation methods to climatic change, many researchers have identified important adaptation strategies (Dick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2008</xref>; Henry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2012</xref>; Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2012</xref>). Despite significant progress, many questions regarding the prospects for ruminant animals mainly of sheep and goats have yet to be recognized (Panin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2000</xref>; Legesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). Some studies (Dick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2008</xref>; Tologbonse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2011</xref>) indicate that different adaptation methods to climate change are applied by sheep and goats farmers at different agro-ecological zones, but these studies failed to identify the determinants of each adaptation method used by each farmer located at each agro-ecological zone. This study, therefore, seeks to analyze the determinants of choices of adaptation strategies to climate change by sheep and goat farmers in the Southern and Central Tigray Zones, North Ethiopia.
