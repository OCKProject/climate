<p class="p">Although the benefits from sheep and goats hold great promise, the current level of its contribution to supporting rural livelihoods is low due to climate change related factors. Thermal, nutritional, and water related stresses, and restlessness are some of the consequences of climate change related factors that affect sheep and goat productivity (AL-Haidary

Increased incidence of disease and parasitic infection, decreasing trend of feed and fodder resources, low productive and reproductive performance are some of the consequences mainly related to the negative effects of climate change (Henry et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2013</xref>). As sheep and goats are owned by the poor section of the rural community who are living in dire poverty, any intervention that improves the productivity of sheep and goats could have positive contribution in reducing the existing poverty in the area.
