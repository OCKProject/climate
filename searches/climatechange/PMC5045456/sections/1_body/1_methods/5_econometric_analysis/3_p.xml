<p class="p">Identification of each factor that influences the behavior of farmers is very important. Although the multinomial probit can be used to measure the set of adaptation choices being applied by sheep and goats producers, its limitation is difficult to make interpretations for the simultaneous influences of explanatory variables on each outcome variable (endogeneity problem cannot be addressed using multinomial probit). This is because the local adaptive choices practiced by the farmers are either substitutive or supplementary of one another. Even if the univariate probit model is possible to estimate the adaptive choices of farmers on the available alternative measures, it is prone to bias due to neglecting the common factors that are not observable and unmeasured. In this case, a separate measurement using probit model never shows the relationships among various adaptation choices.</p>
