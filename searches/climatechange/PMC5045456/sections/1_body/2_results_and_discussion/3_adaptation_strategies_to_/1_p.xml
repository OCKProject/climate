<p class="p">The distribution of adaptation strategies used by sheep and goat farmers in response to climate change is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The most common adaptation strategy is marketing during shock. A total of 307 (96.5 %) farmers were found to use marketing during shock as a climate change adaptation strategy. This practice enabled farmers to sell their sheep and goats during extreme weather events because animals were unable to resist long dry periods due to deficiency of feed and water. However, this has its own drawback, as animals will not be fetching good prices; ideally it is recommended that farmers participate in the normal time market. The second most commonly used adaptation strategy by the farmers is home feeding. Out of the total respondents, 285 (89.6 %) of them practiced this adaptation strategy. As reported by key informants and group discussants, this was mainly because of the introduction of area enclosures in almost all communal lands of villages by which farmers were obliged to feed their animals at home. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, provision of shade during extreme weather events, hot and cold season, was the least practiced adaptation option to cope with climate change effects. This may be because of incidental expenses related to building houses and preparation of bedding that require to incur the high cost of materials and skilled human capital.
