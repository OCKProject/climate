<p class="p">The distribution of adaptation strategies by agro-ecological settings is also presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. In all the three agro-ecological settings, marketing during climate shock is the most commonly used option. On the other side, providing shade during hot and cold season is the least practiced adaptation practice in all the study sites. The table clearly shows that farmers exercising provision of shade in lowland agro-ecological zones consisted of small proportion (22.8 %) as compared to those of in the mid-land (54 %) and highland (52.7 %) regions. Since goats are relatively tolerant of high temperature and are better able to survive in the lowland, farmers in this area may be reluctant to engage in putting up shade, compared to those in the midland and highland areas who mainly rearing sheep.
