<p class="p">Socio-economic and institutional characteristics of the households are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Three hundred eighteen households in three agro-ecological settings were enrolled in this study. Two hundred forty five (77.0 %) were male-headed households; whereas the remaining 73 (23.0 %) were female-headed. Household heads had a mean age of 43 years, and this ranged between 21 and 72 years. Education has an important effect on the choice of adaptation strategies. This is because educated individuals are expected to be exposed to better information about climate change; thereby he/she chooses compatible adaptation strategies. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, 126 (34.6 %) were illiterate (at least they cannot read and write) and 18 (5.6 %) respondents completed secondary school and above. A significant number of the households (92.8 %) had access to credit, and over 60 % participated in off-farm activities. Particularly, the number of off farm participants in the midland agro ecological zone (Alaje district) was found to have the smallest share as compare to the two agro-ecological zones (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). As confirmed by key informants and group discussants, most farmers in Alaje district have fertile farmlands and better opportunity to grow crops and vegetables using irrigation practices. This allowed farmers to stay in own farming instead of pursuing off farming. Income at household level is also an important variable, but under reporting of income by respondents is also expected. Because people are less willing to reveal their income compared to their expenditure. Thus, to control this variable expenditure was used as a proxy for income in this study.
