<p class="p">Prior to the main estimation, pre-estimation, tests were undertaken. Multicollinearity was tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Contingent Coefficient (CC) for continuous and discrete explanatory variables, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). VIF for all continuous variables were &lt;10, and CC for all discrete variables was &lt;0.75, which indicate multicollinearity is not a serious problem in the model estimation (Gujarati

 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). This could be the reason that educated individuals in the study area are engaged in searching off farm job. Therefore, they are less likely to participate in farming practice in which adaptation is required. Only those variables whose coefficients are statistically significant at 1 and 5 % probability levels were discussed.
