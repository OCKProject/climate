<p class="p">Farming experience in the rearing of sheep and goats was one of the explanatory variables thought to affect adaptation strategies to climate change. Farming experience positively and significantly affects the choice of having crossbred animals and shading adaptation practices. This effect suggests that farmers with longer periods of farming experience were more likely to understand climate change and its negative consequences and are more willing to respond to climate change effects through implementing different adaptation practices. In addition, farmers with experience observe changes over time and compare such changes with the current climatic conditions, which enable them to respond to climate change. This result is consistent with other numerous studies (Dhakal et al.
