<p class="p">As expected, different farmers live in different agro-ecological settings, take up different adaptation options (Deressa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2008</xref>; Tazeze et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2012</xref>). This explanatory variable was found to have a significant effect on the provision of shade, having crossbred animals, and home feeding. The model showed a positive relationship of adoption to having crossbred animals and shading adaptation practices, but not for the home feeding practice. This implies that being a resident in highland agro-ecological zone, as compared to that of midland, increases the probability of having crossbred animals and implementing shading practice; whereas it reduces the probability of using home feeding adaptation practice.
