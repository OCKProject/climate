<p class="p">Farming in the lowland agro-ecological setting and involvement in farm associations affects the outcome variable negatively, though the latter was expected to affect the outcome variable positively. This is because, as key informants interview reveal, farm associations build social-capital that supports farmers in providing different technical guidance and advice about agricultural production and overall rural development. Long-dry season is one of the features of lowland agro-ecological zone as compared to other agro-ecological zones, which affects animal feed to be scarce and decreases its nutritive value. Hence, farmers in lowland agro-ecological settings are less competitive in the market of sheep and goat, which indicates that revenue from the sales of sheep and goats, is quite low. Assuming other factors constant, living as a farmer in lowland agro-ecology and involved in farm association decreases the sale of sheep and goats by 1224 and 1982 birr, respectively.</p>
