<p class="p">The result (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>) shows that annual income from the sale of sheep and goats was positively related to farmer’s adaptation practices. Home feeding and having crossbred animals affect the income from the sale of sheep and goats at 1 % significance level. Practicing home feeding and having crossbred animals increased the revenue from the trade of sheep and goat by 1877 and 1182 birr
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> respectively. Other variables such as herd size and access to credit have positive and significant effects on the income. As the herd size increased, animals offered to the market also increased, which results in additional revenues. As the herd size increased by one unit, the sale of sheep and goats increased by 498 birr. Access to credit also has a positive influence on the sales of sheep and goats. This may be because access to credit reduces the financial burden to purchase animal feed and other farm inputs, which boost their agricultural production overall.
