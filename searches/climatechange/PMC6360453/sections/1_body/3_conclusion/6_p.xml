<p class="p">Decarbonization requires dramatic changes in energy systems and policies. Consideration of how policies influence not only the availability of low‚Äê and noncarbon energy technologies but also total energy production and consumption can lead to more sustainable outcomes. Technologies have unintended and unanticipated consequences due to interactions with social, economic, and political forces. In order to effectively reduce carbon emissions, structural changes, such as reducing income inequality, increasing sustainable consumption, and implementing effective regulatory mechanisms, are all necessary.</p>
