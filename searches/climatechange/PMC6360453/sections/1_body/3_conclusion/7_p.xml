<p class="p">The areas of social science literature reviewed in this article point to multiple avenues for future data collection and research. First, there is a significant need to fill data gaps at household, community, and other local levels on drivers as well as mitigation‐ and adaptation‐related issues. Second, we need to increase our understanding of consumer demands, choices, and commodity use, all of which will help target areas in which to reduce emissions. Third, there remains a need to integrate more fully knowledge of physical and social systems, both for understanding driver‐related pathways and for creating successful adaptation and mitigation opportunities.</p>
