<p class="p">This article has summarized bodies of recent research in anthropology, archeology, geography, and sociology on the drivers of climate change, with a focus on the anthropogenic drivers of carbon emissions and factors that influence the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation strategies. As a whole, the research reviewed from these social science disciplines highlights that among the key human factors contributing to climate change are the roles of and connections among economic conditions and development; demographic growth and changes; power, social stratification and inequality; technology; infrastructure; and land‐use change. These factors' near‐ and long‐term dynamic interactions across spatial scales and institutional contexts shape the pathways and options for mitigation and adaptation.</p>
