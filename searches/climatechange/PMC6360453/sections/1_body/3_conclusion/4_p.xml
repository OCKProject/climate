<p class="p">Land use and land transformation are important drivers of climate change because they result from complex interactions on multiple levels. Significant aspects include global treaties, global and local economic forces, national policies and politics, urban–rural relationships, household behaviors, and local infrastructure. Along with exploring this complexity, the social sciences offer alternative adaptation and mitigation strategies that take into account historical ecology and different temporal‐scale relationships between the natural world and the social world.</p>
