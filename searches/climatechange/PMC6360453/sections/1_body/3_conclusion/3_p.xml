<p class="p">Economic activities, and associated growth in income and consumption are major drivers of carbon emissions. Power, social stratification and forms of inequality are often key factors that shape outcomes, including carbon emissions at national and subnational levels. Analyses at the micro‚Äêlevel, such as the household, and in particular spaces, such as urban areas, emphasize that sociocultural contexts are important for understanding consumption as a driver. Population growth is a major driver of climate change, but not all humans contribute equally to carbon emissions.</p>
