<p class="p">World Society Theory, a neo‐institutional tradition within sociology, highlights the role of global institutional structures in influencing social change and environmental outcomes (Meyer, Boli, Thomas, &amp; Ramirez, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). World Society Theory argues that nation‐states are socially constructed actors embedded in a transnational system of structures, agents, and norms that legitimate and encourage some actions and not others. A central actor within world society theory is the International Nongovernmental Organization (INGO). Environmental INGOs are theorized to both reflect and carry forth the content of world society to nation‐states and subnational actors (Longhofer &amp; Schofer, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0147" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Studies in this tradition have found that ties to the pro‐environmental world society (a stronger presence of environmental INGOs) are associated with modest reductions in national‐level carbon emissions (Givens,

 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Research in this tradition also indicates that the effect of economic growth on carbon emissions has moderately decreased in magnitude through time in nations that are most central in the global network of environmental INGOs (Longhofer &amp; Jorgenson, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). In other words, world society integration can help facilitate a decoupling between economic development and emissions.
