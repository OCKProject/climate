<p class="p">In the United States as well, environmental regulations can lead to reductions in carbon emissions from fossil‐fuel burning power plants. Analyzing plant‐level and state‐level data with multilevel modeling techniques, sociologists Grant, Bergstrand, and Running (
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) assess state policy effects on individual power plants' emissions. Both direct strategies, such as emission caps and targets, and indirect strategies, such as public benefit funds, lower plants' emissions and thus can be viable building blocks in a federal climate regime. Other recent research, using longitudinal data from all 50 U.S. states, indicates that the effects of population and affluence on state‐level carbon emissions are substantially moderated by congressional representatives' pro‐environmental voting (Dietz, Frank, Whitley, Kelly, &amp; Kelly,
