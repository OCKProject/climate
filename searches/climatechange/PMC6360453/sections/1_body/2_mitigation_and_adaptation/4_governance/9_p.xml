<p class="p">CDMs use carbon offsets to manage anthropogenic climate change, generally by harnessing technology or engineered solutions through large‐scale energy generation plants or chemical manufacturing facilities that use technology to capture carbon. Social science critiques have identified limitations of CDM programs and policies. For instance, capital flows from offsetting in the compliance market mirror distributional inequities of direct foreign investment: sub‐Saharan Africa attracts less than 2% of such investment, while China, Brazil, and India—the three largest recipients—together receive the bulk of the CDM investment (Bailey, Gouldson, &amp; Newell,
