<p class="p">Research in political sociology also shows the importance of governance structure. A recent study employs multilevel modeling techniques to analyze carbon emissions from fossil‐fuel power plants in the 25 post‐Soviet transition nations in Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia (Jorgenson, Longhofer, Grant, Sie, &amp; Giedraitis, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Various plant‐level factors are associated with higher emissions, including coal as the primary fuel source, plant size and age, capacity utilization rate, and heat rate. Regarding governance, results indicate that plant‐level emissions are lower, on average, in the transition nations that joined the European Union (EU), whose market reforms and environmental directives are quite relevant for emissions reductions. These negative associations between plant‐level emissions and EU accession are larger for the post‐Soviet nations that joined the EU earlier relative to those that joined more recently.
