<p class="p">Human responses to the risks and impacts of climate change largely fit into two categories: mitigation and adaptation (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014c</xref>). “Mitigation” refers to a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of carbon and other GHG (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014b</xref>). “Adaptation” refers to adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects; such adjustments moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014a</xref>). Both mitigation and adaptation occur at various spatial and temporal scales, using approaches that apply technological, economic, institutional, regulatory, ecosystem‐based, informational, and social factors (Carmin et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Rosenzweig et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0194" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In addition, mitigation and adaptation decisions are subject to path‐dependency, meaning current options are often constrained by the outcomes of past decisions (Ehrhardt‐Martinez, Rudel, Norgaard, &amp; Broadbent, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). While the drivers of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG are largely international and global, the effects of contemporary climate change are experienced locally (Miller Hesed &amp; Paolisso, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0161" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This section discusses how approaches to mitigating and adapting to climate change are influenced by both long‐term and near‐term social processes as well as relationships between various actors.
