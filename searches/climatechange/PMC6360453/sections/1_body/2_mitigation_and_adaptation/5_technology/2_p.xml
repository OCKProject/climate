<p class="p">Energy use has evolved over millennia, and because its current concentration in fossil fuels is integral to economic growth, changing that concentration will likely be difficult within the structure of the contemporary world economy (Antonio &amp; Clark,

For example, increasing energy efficiency through technological innovations is often assumed to be an effective strategy for reducing energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency lowers the price of energy and related services, however, so it may increase demand for them and thereby cause total emissions to rise—a point that William Stanley Jevons first argued in the nineteenth century (York &amp; McGee,
