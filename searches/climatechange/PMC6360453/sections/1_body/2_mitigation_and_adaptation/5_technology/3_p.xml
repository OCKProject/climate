Their findings indicate that each of these factors has a significant interaction with efficiency and thus shapes environmentally destructive rebound effects. Related research finds that the dirtiest 5% of fossil fuel power plants in nations throughout the world are disproportionately responsible for large shares of their sectors' total emissions. If these plants continued generating the same amount of electricity but met particular intensity targets through enhanced efficiencies or through other means, the world's total electricity‚Äêbased carbon emissions could be reduced by as much as 40% (Grant, Jorgenson, &amp; Longhofer,
