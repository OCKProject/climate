<p class="p">An important example of the unanticipated consequences of technological change is the role of renewable energy: it is not necessarily the case that adding renewable energy sources without structural changes to the economy will reduce fossil fuel use. Sociological research by York (
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0235" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>) indicates that in nations around the world since 1960, growth in nonfossil fuel sources only minimally displaced fossil fuel use (controlling for economic growth, population growth, and other factors)â€”that is, nonfossil energy sources were largely added to, rather than in place of, fossil energy sources (see also Greiner, York, &amp; McGee,

This finding, although superficially surprising, fits with a long tradition of research in technology studies which finds that technologies often have unanticipated consequences, due to interactions with social, economic, and political forces. Other sociological research suggests that interactions between the increasing use of renewable energy sources and economic growth may also lead to a tighter coupling of GDP to carbon emissions because renewables are more likely to be used to replace nuclear power than to replace fossil fuels, thus maintaining the dominance of fossil fuels as the base load electricity source (Thombs,
