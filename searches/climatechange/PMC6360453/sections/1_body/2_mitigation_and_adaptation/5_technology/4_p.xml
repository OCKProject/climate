<p class="p">In an effort to effectively identify hyper‐polluting plants throughout the world that are disproportionately responsible for the electricity generation sector's total emissions, Grant, Jorgenson, and Longhofer (
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) employ qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) techniques to analyze the conjoint effects of global, political, and organizational conditions on fossil‐fueled plants' carbon emissions. QCA treats cases as combinations of attributes and uses Boolean algebra to derive expressions of combinations associated with an outcome. Such a technique is well suited to evaluate higher‐order interactions and determine which of several possible combinations of factors are most relevant for an outcome. Their findings reveal that hyper‐polluters' emission rates are a function of four distinct causal recipes, which they label coercive, quiescent, expropriative, and inertial configurations, and these same sets of conditions also increase plants' emission levels (Grant et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Coercive and quiescent configurations enhance plants' ability to externalize their carbon emissions by neutralizing and manipulating potential sources of resistance, whereas expropriative and inertial configurations inhibit plants' ability to curb emissions by subjecting them to opportunistic behavior and forces of inertia.
