<p class="p">By looking at long‐term changes from the past, archeology demonstrates that similar outcomes occurred in different areas that were affected by local climate change patterns (Redman, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0183" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). For example, the Long Term Vulnerability and Transformations Project based at Arizona State University, in collaboration with the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization, compares multiple societies' responses to sudden impacts of climate change in the thirteenth through fifteenth centuries CE. While the environment and societies were radically different, cases of successful adaptation had common underlying structural patterns. Although researchers have also identified painful transitions and full‐scale societal collapse, common successful adaptations include balancing population size against available resources, having a diverse portfolio of food and other choices, social networks that reduce risk, storage systems, mobility and migration, equal access to resources, and reduction of barriers to resources (Nelson et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0167" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Historically, resistance to adopting tools from other cultures and over‐commitment to forms of fixed infrastructure, such as irrigation, have often led to adverse path dependency. Societal collapse is known to be associated with inflexible or out‐of‐phase management responses and the depletion of the social capital that legitimizes collective responses. Research by Chase and Scarborough (
