 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0184" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) uses adaptive‐management strategies that draw upon long‐term perspectives developed through archeology. The Resilience Alliance and other interdisciplinary networks of scientists and practitioners work on not only improving response to sudden (often catastrophic) threshold crossing events but also identifying warning signals that such thresholds are being approached (i.e., forecasting tipping points, while there may still be time to mitigate and adapt). Threshold crossings are normally a complex mix of environmental and social factors, and developing a wider spectrum of such “red flag” variables can alert managers to oncoming transformations. For example, Streeter, Dugmore, Lawson, Erlendsson, and Edwards (
