<p class="p">Anthropologists, archeologists, geographers, and sociologists have demonstrated that land‐use transformation is an underlying cause of anthropogenic climate change. Some evidence to support this conclusion is derived from the long, continuous record of human‐induced changes. Land‐use transformation results from contextual and proximate causes. Contextual causes include a range of international market and institutional arrangements. Proximate causes are human activities that more directly contribute to emissions.</p>
