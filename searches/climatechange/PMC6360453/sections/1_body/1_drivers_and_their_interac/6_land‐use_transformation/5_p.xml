For example, Brazil's history of highway and hydro‐electric dam infrastructure development in the Amazon demonstrates how investments can lead to unanticipated and unsustainable population booms. These booms not only lead to challenges in human wellbeing through a lack of services, economic inequalities and loss of livelihood, but also related ecological challenges like deforestation, with attendant climate consequences (Fearnside,

National governments often play active roles in development that results in deforestation, while local growth coalitions press for road building and development, even when national governments pull back from deforestation‐causing activities (Rudel,
