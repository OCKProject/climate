<p class="p">A number of factors account for the positive associations between emissions and income inequality and wealth inequality. Higher‐income and wealthier groups tend to consume more goods and services as they engage in Veblenian status‐consumption (Veblen, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1934</xref>) or consumption competition (Schor, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). These dynamics lead households to increase their spending to keep up with the visible lifestyles of higher‐income, wealthier households, which in recent decades has entailed consumption of energy‐intensive luxuries such as multiple homes and private planes. The wealthy are also owners of polluting firms and energy producing enterprises. To protect these assets, they are more likely to use their economic resources to gain political power, which they use to dominate the policy environment (Downey,

 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and recent sociological research, reviewed above, has shown that increased working hours are drivers of energy consumption and carbon emissions (e.g., Fitzgerald et al.,
