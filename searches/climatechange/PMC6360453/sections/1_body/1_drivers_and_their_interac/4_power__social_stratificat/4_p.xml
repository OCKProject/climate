Larger shares of value added, in comparison to shares of pollution, are generally prompted within more‐developed countries, while less‐developed countries experience more environmental destruction and associated health impacts per unit of value added for their contribution to global supply chains (Burns, Davis, &amp; Kick,

Bangladesh, Cambodia, and India are leading producers of textiles, and Laos, Myanmar, and several nations in Africa have many sites of “land grabs,” the buying or leasing of land for export production on terms unfavorable to local people, with consequences for the environment and climate change, including deforestation (Marselis, Feng, Liu, Teodoro, &amp; Hubacek,
