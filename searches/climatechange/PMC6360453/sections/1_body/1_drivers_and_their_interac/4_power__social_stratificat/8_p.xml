<p class="p">Another important aspect of inequality related to emissions is ecologically unequal exchange, a perspective that cuts across multiple social science disciplines, including anthropology, geography, and sociology. Unequal international exchange is the assertion of asymmetrical power relationships between more‐developed and less‐developed countries, as the former gain disproportionate advantages at the expense of the latter through trade patterns and global production networks. Ecologically unequal exchange refers to the environmentally damaging removal of energy and other natural‐resource assets from and the externalization of environmentally damaging production and disposal activities to less‐developed countries. Research in this tradition indicates that asymmetrical trade relationships and global production network characteristics contribute to the growth of energy use, production‐based carbon emissions and deforestation within developing nations (Bunker,
