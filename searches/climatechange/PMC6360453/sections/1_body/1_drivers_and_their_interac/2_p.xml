<p class="p">The long‐term and near‐term drivers of climate change continuously interact (Dietz, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Among the anthropogenic drivers of carbon emissions that anthropology, archeology, geography, and sociology investigate are economic systems, including growth, cycles, consumption, and trade; power, social stratification, and inequality; population growth and demographic shifts; technology; infrastructure; and land‐use change and land transformation. “Long” and “near” terms are often defined differently within and between disciplines. “Long‐term” may be applied to several decades, one or more centuries, or even longer periods, while “near‐term” may refer to a period shorter than a year.
