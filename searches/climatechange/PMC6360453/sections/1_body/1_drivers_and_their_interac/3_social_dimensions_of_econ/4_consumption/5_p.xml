<p class="p">Consumer practices are important as well. An increase in energy‐intensive practices, such as greater use of heating and cooling or a shift to daily showering, tends to increase emissions, but modifying these practices or adopting others, such as choosing public transportation over driving, can reduce emissions (Dietz, Gardner, Gilligan, Stern, &amp; Vandenbergh,

Choosing green energy options, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, has been shown to have a strong spatial pattern of adoption leading to the conclusion that “peer effects” can be a strong force in consumer choices. Adoption often occurs among neighboring residences, irrespective of economic class and political party (Graziano &amp; Gillingham,
