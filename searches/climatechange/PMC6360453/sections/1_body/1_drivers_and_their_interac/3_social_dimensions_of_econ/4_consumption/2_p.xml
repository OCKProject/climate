<p class="p">As consumption is frequently the largest component of output, social scientists have studied its role in GHG emissions. Thus, the rise of consumer society or consumer culture, in which human beings increasingly practice a consumer‐oriented way of life, can be understood as a driver of emissions (Baudrillard,

Income, infrastructure, social organization, and culture all affect expenditure patterns and investment and in turn have direct effects on climate change. Higher income and wealth generally lead to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions. And according to research in geography, the urbanization of populations, particularly in low and moderate income settings, is also associated with the development of high resource‐consuming lifestyles (Leichenko &amp; Solecki,
