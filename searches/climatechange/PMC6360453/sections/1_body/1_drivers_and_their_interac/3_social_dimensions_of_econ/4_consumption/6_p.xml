<p class="p">The “lifestyle” concept is also useful in analyzing carbon emissions. The ways in which people live and consume are reflected in the consumption patterns of societal groups with different socioeconomic characteristics, such as identity, education, employment, or family status (Baiocchi, Minx, &amp; Hubacek, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Housing is one significant aspect of lifestyle‐related choices (Huddart Kennedy, Krahn, &amp; Krogman, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Suburbanites, especially in more affluent nations, generally purchase large, capacious homes with substantial heating and cooling requirements. Commuting distance and access to public transportation, recreation areas, city centers, public services, and shops are other important neighborhood‐specific, lifestyle‐associated determinants of carbon emissions (Baiocchi et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Drivers for different lifestyle groups have been assessed by geographers at fine spatial scales using big data (Hubacek et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Geo‐demographics uses a large set of spatially specific variables of characteristics that account for household context as it contributes to emission patterns. The key determinants of lifestyle‐related emissions, as identified through this type of analysis, could also impede change and emissions reduction.
