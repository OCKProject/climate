<p class="p">Carbon disparity across nations changes with increasing income. Research in geography by Hubacek et al. (
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017a</xref>) shows that when countries are ranked from lowest to highest income, substantial variation becomes evident among lower‚Äêincome countries: there is a declining disparity of carbon footprints within a country as income increases. The disparity in carbon footprints declines as countries become richer, but the average carbon footprint increases along with income. They also find for all countries that the carbon footprint grows with increasing income even though carbon intensity tends to decline, that is, more lower carbon consumption expenditures (such as a larger share of healthcare or education) are added into the consumption mix as income rises.
