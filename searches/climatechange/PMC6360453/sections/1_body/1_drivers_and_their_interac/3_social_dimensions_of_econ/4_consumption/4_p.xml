<p class="p">Anthropologically and sociologically, understanding consumption as a driver takes into account cultural and social contexts (Dietz, Stern, &amp; Weber, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), such as through examining status consumption and status competition (Ehrhardt‐Martinez &amp; Schor,

 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0229" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Status seeking contributes to emissions as it leads people to purchase carbon‐intensive consumer goods and services, such as large homes, large vehicles, frequent vacations, and other luxuries, which have tended to serve as status markers on account of their social visibility (Schor, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Consumption patterns are also capable of helping to reduce emissions, however, when green products such as hybrid vehicles or solar roof installations become high‐status indicators (Griskevicus, Tybur, &amp; Van Den Bergh,
