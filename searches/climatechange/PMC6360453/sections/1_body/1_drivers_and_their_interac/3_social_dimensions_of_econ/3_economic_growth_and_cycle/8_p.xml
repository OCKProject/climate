<p class="p">The collapse of the Soviet Union also led to declines in GHG emissions. During the 1990s, the former Soviet republics experienced demographic and economic decline along with de‚Äêurbanization, all of which influenced carbon emissions. Studying these trends, York (

The related infrastructural momentum (the energy capacity and demand stemming from durable infrastructure like roads, pipelines, and factories, that persist even in economic downturns), however, meant that former Soviet republics still had higher emissions than other low to moderate income nations that had not industrialized so intensively (York,
