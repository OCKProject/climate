<p class="p">Recent sociological analyses of national carbon emissions have also highlighted notable temporal differences in the effects of urbanization across regions, which is tightly connected to processes of economic growth (Jorgenson, Auerbach, &amp; Clark, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For nations in Asia, the estimated effect of urbanization (measured as the percent of the nation's population residing in urban areas) on emissions has increased in magnitude through time, while for nations in Latin America, the estimated effect of urbanization has fluctuated slightly through time, but continues to be moderate in magnitude. For the wealthier nations in North America, Europe, and Oceania, the effect of urbanization on emissions is larger than for nations in other regions, but gradually decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by a moderate increase in the early 2000s. Related research shows that in developing nations with a larger urban slum prevalence, the overall effect of urbanization on carbon emissions is suppressed to some extent, given that households in urban slums are structurally disadvantaged and generally consume less fossil fuel energy and other carbon‚Äêintensive goods (Givens,
