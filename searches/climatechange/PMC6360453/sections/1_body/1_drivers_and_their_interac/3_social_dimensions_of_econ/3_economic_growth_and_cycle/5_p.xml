<p class="p">Similar modeling techniques that include interactions between time and measures of GDP per capita have been used in studies of the effect of economic growth on the “carbon intensity of human well‐being” (CIWB)—a ratio between per capita carbon emissions and a measure of human well‐being—for samples of nations in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa (Jorgenson, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Findings suggest that the effect of GDP per capita on CIWB is relatively large, positive, and stable in magnitude through time for nations in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and has increased in magnitude through time for nations in the other regional samples (Jorgenson,
