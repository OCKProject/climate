<p class="p">Sociologists have also analyzed differences in how components of GDP contribute to emissions. For example, a series of cross‐sectional (Schor,

 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) show that working hours are strongly associated with carbon emissions, whether considering just developed countries, both developing and developed countries, or within the United States, across states. The strongest relationship is what has been called the “scale effect:” the number of hours worked is associated with the size of aggregate output. Countries that have reduced average hours, such as Northern European countries, are lower emitters, ceteris paribus. The second, smaller channel of influence, (the “composition effect”) occurs via household decision‐making: holding income constant, households with less free time engage in more carbon‐intensive consumption. This hypothesized effect has not been measured directly, but is evident in economy‐wide analyses.
