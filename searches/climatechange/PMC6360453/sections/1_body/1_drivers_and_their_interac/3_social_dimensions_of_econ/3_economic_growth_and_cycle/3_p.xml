<p class="p">Briefly, ecological modernization theory suggests that processes of modernization result in added reflexivity throughout the socioeconomic system (Mol,

Technological development and environmental consciousness, both of which go hand‐in‐hand with economic development, are seen as key components of modernization via the greening of industrial production processes, including reduced fossil fuel consumption, while also leading to more sustainable forms of consumption. In contrast, treadmill of production theory argues that since market economies are predicated on increasing profits through expansion, energy consumption and forms of pollution continually expand while overall environmental conditions deteriorate (Gould, Pellow, &amp; Schnaiberg,

 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>). Thus, economic development involves increases in resource use and waste generated from the various stages in production processes, including increased fossil fuel consumption and resultant carbon emissions.
