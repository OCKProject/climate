<p class="p">The size and growth of the human population are well established as major drivers of environmental change, including carbon emissions, and much social science research provides empirical evidence supporting these claims (Burns et al.,

However, the complex environmental effects of population growth, combined with other demographic factors, are less often documented. While population growth in poor nations, which tends to be higher than in rich nations, contributes to rising energy consumption and emissions, research in geography and sociology suggests that such growth threatens global climate stability less than wealthy nations' consumption practices do (Hubacek, Baiocchi, Feng, &amp; Patwardhan,
