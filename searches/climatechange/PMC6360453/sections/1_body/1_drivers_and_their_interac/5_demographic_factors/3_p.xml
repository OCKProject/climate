<p class="p">Beyond population size and growth, other demographic characteristics with important implications for emissions include age distribution, number of households, and average household size in a given population (Adua, York, &amp; Schuelke‚ÄêLeech, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Energy use and emissions tend to be higher when a larger share of the population is working aged (York, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0232" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In developed countries, with larger aging populations, low fertility helps to suppress emissions, but the changing age structure only modestly limits emissions, at least in the short term (York, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0232" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In some contexts, the number of households is a more important driver of environmental impacts than is the number of people (Liu, Daily, Ehrlich, &amp; Luck, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; York &amp; Rosa, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0241" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Household size is declining in affluent nations, which leads to increases in energy consumption and carbon emissions (Weber &amp; Matthews, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0227" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Average household size also has begun to decline in rapidly developing countries as well (Leichenko &amp; Solecki, 
 <xref rid="wcc554-bib-0143" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>).
