<p class="p">While far from an exhaustive review of what the four disciplines have to offer, the article covers important contributions from these disciplines that inform knowledge of drivers and responses to climate change. It begins with discussions of temporal dimensions, identifying and presenting interactions between long‐term and near‐term human drivers of carbon emissions. Next, descriptions of the disciplines' contributions to the understanding of mitigation and adaptation are provided. The conclusion includes a summary of key lessons offered by the four disciplines as well as suggestions for future research.</p>
