<p class="p">Shorebird populations and flyways across the planet are currently being affected by other stressors, many of them unknown, in addition to climate change, e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-International1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>. These impacts are resulting in severe population reductions 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Brown1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Bart1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>. Based on our analyses, adding the stresses and risks imposed by a changing climate to this already threatened baseline renders shorebirds even more vulnerable to extinction. If we are correctly to understand the risks to which shorebirds are exposed, and to identify and implement effective conservation strategies and actions, it is important that we understand these vulnerabilities, particularly those that will occur due to climate change. The purpose of this study was to assess the climate change risks to shorebirds and incorporate these into existing vulnerability evaluations so that we gain a better understanding of the entire panoply of risk factors to which these species are exposed, and their resulting overall vulnerabilities.
