<p class="p">What would it take to accurately and precisely predict change in extinction risk due to climate change for migratory shorebirds, or for any species, rather than taking the relatively coarse approach we did in this paper? Certainly there have been detailed assessments of expected regional changes in shorebird populations in response to climate change

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-AielloLammens1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[113]</xref>, and one could create models to link species to landscapes via simulation. But what would be required for accurate, reliable predictions? Strictly speaking, to build a convincing case for an accurate prediction, the first thing we would need is accurate models of climate change. Although there are many models of climate change, and they agree in general with climate trends, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the exact amount of changes in expected temperature and precipitation, e.g.

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[115]</xref>, particularly at the fine geographic scale that would be needed to understand biotic responses, including the effects of changes in wind patterns 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Gill1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[116]</xref>. Because hydrological models are complex (i.e., non–linear, with feedback and chaotic dynamics), more accurate data are unlikely to improve model predictions
