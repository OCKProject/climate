 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Klaassen1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[98]</xref>. Our separation of species into distance categories was done by looking for natural breaks in the migration distance data, resulting in distances being divided into 5 categories (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108899-g001" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Migration distances were calculated from the approximate center of each species' breeding range to the approximate center of each species' wintering range using data from NatureServe 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Ridgely1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[99]</xref>. The two exceptions were Bristle–thighed Curlew and Bar–tailed Godwit, which are not covered by this database. Known migration distances placed these species in the greatest–distance category.
