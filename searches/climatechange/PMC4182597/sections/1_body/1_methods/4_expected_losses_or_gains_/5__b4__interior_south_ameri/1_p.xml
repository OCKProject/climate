<p class="p">Ecological modeling based on climate change models indicates that increased aridification in South America will have the following effects: first it is likely to result in the replacement of currently forested areas in the Amazon by savanna habitat and seasonal forests

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Malhi1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[71]</xref>. Experimental droughts in the eastern Brazilian Amazon resulted in increased tree mortality, which also supports the expectation of declining rainforest habitat 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-LoladaCosta1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[72]</xref>. This is unlikely to benefit shorebirds as few use the existing savanna habitats in central South America. Second, the existing grassland areas in central and southern South America will become drier
