 <xref rid="pone.0108899-US1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[13]</xref>. IUCN lists five shorebird species in North America as Near Threatened or at higher risk, and four additional species in these categories for the Western Hemisphere 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-International2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[14]</xref>. The causes of these declines are not well understood but most likely include loss of breeding, migration, and wintering habitats, and disturbance and exploitation

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Austin1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[17]</xref>. It should be recognized, however, that the factors causing such changes could be global, since population reductions have been seen in virtually all shorebird flyways from North and South America, to East Africa, to Asia and Australia, e.g.,
