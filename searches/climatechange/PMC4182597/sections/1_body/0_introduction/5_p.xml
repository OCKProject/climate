<p class="p">Categorizing vulnerability to extinction based on a suite of characteristics, such as population size and rate of decline, is used widely e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Millsap1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Gardali1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[31]</xref>. The best known models are those of Partners in Flight and IUCN (also used by BirdLife International) 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Panjabi1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[32]</xref>. Their categorization approach to vulnerability also can be used to evaluate species' changes in vulnerability as ecosystems change over time, e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Higdon1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[33]</xref>. Partners in Flight (PIF) uses a model to assess vulnerability based on population trend, relative abundance, threats during the breeding and non–breeding seasons, and breeding and non–breeding range sizes. For each category, each species receives a score of 1 to 5, with 5 associated with greatest risk. These scores are summed using several different formulas, each of which is used to determine species of conservation concern for particular reasons. A similar system was developed based on the same set of basic variables for the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Brown1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>, although the resulting risk categories are defined somewhat differently. None of these systems includes risk due to climate change. In this paper, it was our overarching goal to determine the degree to which climate change will alter the extinction risk level assigned to shorebird species in the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, and for this method to be compatible with the PIF ranking system.
