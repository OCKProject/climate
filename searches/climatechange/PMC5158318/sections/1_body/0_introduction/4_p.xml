<p class="p">Here we explore the influence of narrative in the professional communication of climate science research, acknowledging that the perception of narrative can be subjective and context-dependent [

 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. We hypothesized that scientific papers with more narrative text are more likely to be highly cited than those with less narrative (i.e., more expository) text, using citation frequency as a proxy for a paper’s influence on the field at large. To test this hypothesis, we derived six elements of narrativity from studies on narrative comprehension [

 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and the literatures of psychology [

 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and narrative theory [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and used these six elements to evaluate the degree of narrativity in 732 abstracts taken from the peer-reviewed scientific literature on climate change. We then assessed the relationship between narrativity in these journal abstracts in the context of other factors known to influence citation rate, including journal identity, abstract length, and number of authors.
