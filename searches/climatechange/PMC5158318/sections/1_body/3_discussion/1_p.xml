<p class="p">Our results reveal that—at least among the set of peer-reviewed climate change literature included in our dataset—articles featuring more narrative writing styles are more often cited. This effect is independent of year of publication, number of authors, or abstract length. Of the narrative elements we tested for, the use of sensory language, conjunctions, connectivity between sentences, and appeal (or plea) to the reader all positively and significantly influenced citation frequency. Of these four attributes, appeal [i.e., to the reader] is perhaps most broadly construed and least understood. Nevertheless, the fact that appeal emerged as a key factor in the PCA suggests its importance in climate science writing. It could be the case that appeal is positively associated with narrativity because, in the context of climate science, authors are likely to offer a recommendation (where recommendation is one definition of the term) that is identifiable to or understood by the reader.</p>
