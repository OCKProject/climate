<p class="p">Our study design did not allow us to test the mechanism(s) of association between narrativity and citation frequency. However, our results add to a growing literature that underscores an important role for narrative communication structure in readersâ€™ abilities to process and recall information. Without knowing the specific cognitive mechanism(s) involved, it appears that the uptake and subsequent use of scientific information is positively influenced by narrative writing styles.</p>
