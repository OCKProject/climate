<p class="p">Our findings are consistent with the prevailing understanding across a range of fields that audiences tend to understand and recall narratives—that is, stories—far better than information received in other ways [

The result is surprising, though, in the context of professional scientific communication, in which expository styles dominate the published literature, word counts are strictly limited by editorial policies, graphics are routinely used to present results, and citation frequency is often considered to depend largely—even primarily—upon the strength of the science. These conventions and constraints would seem to eliminate any role for narrativity in professional scientific writing, but our results indicate otherwise.
