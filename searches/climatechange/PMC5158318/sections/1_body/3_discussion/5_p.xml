<p class="p">Peer-reviewed scientific discourse is often viewed as a special form of communication, exempt from the qualities of narratives that humans inherently relate to. However, our findings support an alternative interpretation: scientists can engage readers and increase uptake by incorporating narrative attributes into their writing styles. Among the variables we tested, connectedness, or the extent to which sentences are logically related, has the greatest positive influence. Moreover, the use of evaluative commentary can be used to positive effect. By incorporating such attributes into their writing, scientists can more closely mirror the way we as humans experience and understand the world.</p>
