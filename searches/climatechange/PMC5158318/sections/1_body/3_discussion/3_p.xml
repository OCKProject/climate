<p class="p">Despite the significant effect of narrative style, we found the journal of publication—particularly as captured by the journal’s impact factor—was most closely associated with citation frequency of individual articles. However, we found an unexpectedly strong correlation between narrativity and journal impact factor: more highly cited journals feature more narrative writing styles. We might speculate that this effect stems from differences in editorial policies that subtly encourage or discourage narrative styles, or that, especially in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic>, effectively communicating to a highly interdisciplinary audience requires a more narrative style. It may also be that more senior authors—presumably publishing in higher-impact journals more often—feel freer to write in a more narrative style. Whatever the reason, the message to authors is clear: up to a point, more narrative writing styles can increase the uptake and ultimate visibility of one’s research.
