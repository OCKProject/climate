<p class="p">Online contributors evaluated abstracts by first reading instructions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167983.s003" class="xref">S1 Text</xref>) and an example question, and then answering a series of six questions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167983.s004" class="xref">S2 Text</xref>) for each abstract. These questions were intended to evaluate each abstract with respect to indicators of narrativity (described in the next section). Contributors were paid per submitted page, each of which included five abstracts and the corresponding questions.
