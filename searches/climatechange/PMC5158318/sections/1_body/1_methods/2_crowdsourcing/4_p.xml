<p class="p">We used the following measures to ensure high quality responses: 1) gave access to this job only to CrowdFlowerâ€™s highest ranked contributors (the site ranks them based upon past performance); 2) set a minimum completion time for each page of work; and 3) restricted contributor location to a number of countries in which English is the primary language and literacy rates are high: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. Although our primary reason for imposing this restriction was based on language skills, we note that these countries largely correspond to those that dominate climate change publications, both in terms of number and citation frequency [
