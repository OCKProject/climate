<p class="p">We identified 19 journals with the largest number of articles meeting these criteria, and then retrieved the abstracts, citation counts, and other relevant information through the database Web of Science (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167983.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>; raw dataset N = 802 abstracts; N = 732 after quality control; see below). These abstracts differed in citation frequency by two orders of magnitude, having been cited between 1 and 1205 times as of March 30, 2016 (median = 69; we did not collect data on papers with zero citations in order to avoid the problems associated with log-transforming zero data), and reflected the expected left-skewed distribution.
