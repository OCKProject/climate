<p class="p">We treated Question 2, “Does the narrator refer to himself in the text?” as a “test” question, or secondary quality-control mechanism, due to its objectivity (i.e., unlike some of the other narrative indicators, the existence of a first-person narrator has a “true” answer). After considering all seven responses for this question, respondents who answered in the majority were included in the analysis, whereas respondents who answered in the minority were assumed to be in error and their responses were omitted entirely from the analysis. This improved our confidence in the responses and subsequent analysis. After omitting these minority responses, we averaged the scores across remaining responses for each independent variable to yield a dataset with one value per indicator for each abstract.</p>
