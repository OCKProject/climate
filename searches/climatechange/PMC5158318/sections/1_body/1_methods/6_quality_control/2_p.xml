<p class="p">Narrative variables with “yes/no” categorical responses (i.e., the indicators “setting”, “narrative perspective”, and “appeal”) were assigned numeric binary values (0 or 1) by rounding respondents’ mean scores (e.g., where 5 out of 7 respondents scored an abstract as having a direct appeal to the reader, the mean appeal score for the abstract was 5/7, or 0.71, and we rounded this score to 1 to reflect the idea that the abstract did indeed contain a direct appeal). We used the mean response scores for the other, non-binary narrative variables (“conjunctions”, “connectivity”, and “sensory”). This turned an otherwise discrete variable into a continuous variable, creating an index that captured variations in perceptions of narrativity. For example, contributors might count different numbers of connective phrases and links in a piece of text. Taking the mean, and thereby including the disagreement among responses, produced an overall measure of perceived connectivity for that piece of text. These methods incorporated the subjective nature of narrativity into the results.</p>
