 <italic class="italic">Connectivity</italic> refers to words or phrases that create explicit links within the text, either as a specific reference back to the same thing or repetition of a word from the previous sentence, provided it carries the same meaning [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. We assessed connectivity by asking contributors to count the number of times that words or phrases from one sentence were used to create an explicit link to the sentence immediately preceding it. We provided contributors the additional instruction to look for logical linkage between ideas. We then normalized the resulting counts by abstract length.
