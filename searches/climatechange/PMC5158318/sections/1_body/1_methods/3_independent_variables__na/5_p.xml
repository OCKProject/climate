 <italic class="italic">Conjunctions</italic> are used to connect words and phrases, binding narratives together in a logical form [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. We used the presence of conjunctions to determine the extent to which an abstract is logically ordered, based on the observation that a temporal or causal ordering of events is an essential, and distinguishing, characteristic of narratives [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], one which implies momentum towards completion [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and evokes human understanding [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We assessed the use of conjunctions by asking contributors to count the number of times that conjunctions signifying cause and effect, contrast, or temporal ordering appeared in the text. We then normalized the resulting counts by abstract length.
