<p class="p">We used citation frequency as a measure of article influence. A large body of literature supports the use of citation analyses as frameworks for evaluating science communication [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Citations reflect the cumulative nature of science and the extent to which a piece of work is represented in a body of literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0167983.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and can therefore be used as to evaluate the degree of influence of a publication on its field. We used Web of Science to establish the number of citations for the articles associated with each abstract in our dataset. We log-transformed citation counts to account for the skewed distribution in citations.
