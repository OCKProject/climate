<p class="p">Following ordination of the six narrative elements using PCA, PC1 served as our index of narrativity, and was significantly correlated with log(citations) (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.05, p = 10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167983.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). PC1 (Narrativity index) varied significantly among journals (p = 10
 <sup class="sup">−15</sup>), and correlated strongly and positively with log journal impact factor (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.62, p = 6 x 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>; carried out on PC1 journal means to avoid pseudoreplication), such that higher-impact journals tended to have more narrative articles (
