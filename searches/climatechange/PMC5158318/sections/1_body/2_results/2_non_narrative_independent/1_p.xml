<p class="p">We found no citation effect for abstract length after accounting for journal (different journals feature abstracts of different lengths); papers with more authors had subtly, but significantly, more citations than those with fewer authors even after controlling for journal (log(N authors), p &lt; 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup>; each additional author was associated with an additional 0.4 citations in the dataset). Citations varied predictably by journal (ANOVA; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.43; p &lt; 10
 <sup class="sup">−15</sup>), and this effect was largely captured by journal impact factor (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.37; p &lt; 10
 <sup class="sup">−15</sup>; log(2010 impact factor)). Year of publication (2009 vs. 2010) had a small but significant effect on citations (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.05; p = 10
 <sup class="sup">−10</sup>; the average paper from 2010 had 1.5 fewer citations than the average paper from 2009).
