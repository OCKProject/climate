<p class="p">A general increase in water availability might be beneficial for the agricultural sector but there are other potential problems in the form of flooding during intense rainfall and higher peak flows. Therefore, the return periods (2, 10, 100 years; 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0163941.e005" class="xref">Eq 5</xref>) of peak flows were investigated and compared with baseline scenarios. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163941.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> reveals the percentage increase or decrease of return flows for each basin in the dry and wet season. For the dry season, an increase in peak flows were found for the CNCM3 and MPEH5 models in Luzon, whereas the magnitude of return flows would remain unchanged according to the BCM2 model. It was also expected that Luzon will experience the most dramatic increase in peak flows for all scenarios. Luzon and Viscayas can expect an increase in return flow compared to the baseline in the dry and wet season (see
