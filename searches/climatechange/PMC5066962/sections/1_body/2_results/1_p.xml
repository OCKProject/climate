<p class="p">The results of the STREAM calibrations and seasonal water availability are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163941.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, where the downscaled average (1979-2010) seasonal water balances (precipitation-evaporation) are shown for four different periods (Dec-Feb, Mar-May, Jun-Aug and Sep-Nov) across the Philippines, with values mostly positive, and ranging up to 3000 mm. For climate Types I and III, values are mostly negative during the dry season, which means water from soil storage is mostly evaporated. The different climate types (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163941.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) are well represented, with relatively dry periods for Types I and III in the months Dec-May (two left figures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163941.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>), whereas Type II is relatively wet during these periods. For climate Type IV, the water balance is relatively even throughout the year, while water availability is higher in mountainous regions compared to lower elevation areas.
