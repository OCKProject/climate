<p class="p">This study provides a general assessment of plausible climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources in the Philippines. However, for the available data, the relatively coarse scale of the climate data and the nationwide approach, specific aspects such as land cover changes or hydraulic infrastructure that might significantly impact local hydrology were not explicitly accounted for in this study. The hydrology model is a simple water balance model without sophisticated water routing. The estimations presented of river flows are at the basin outlet but does not include spatio-temporal dynamics within the basin. Important climatological features such as tropical cyclones and El Ni

A more direct link between the climate models, downscaling techniques and hydrological model would facilitate the investigation of a wider range of options.
