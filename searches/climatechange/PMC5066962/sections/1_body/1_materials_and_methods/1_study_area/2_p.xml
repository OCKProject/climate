<p class="p">The climate of the Philippines can be divided into four distinct categories using the modified Coronas classification [
 <xref rid="pone.0163941.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0163941.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163941.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. Climate Type I is characterized by a distinct dry period from November to April and a wet season from May to October. Type II results in rainfall being evenly distributed throughout year, but with a very pronounced rainy season from November to January. In Type III, the seasons are not very pronounced, but a relatively dry period prevails from November to April. Finally, in Type IV, precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year. In this analysis, we used the modified Coronas classification as the basis of making the distinction between dry and wet months.
