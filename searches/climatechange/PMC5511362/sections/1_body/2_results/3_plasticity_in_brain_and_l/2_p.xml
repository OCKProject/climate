<p class="p">We used the whole‐transcriptome (RNA sequencing) data to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the male sticklebacks that experienced warm winter temperatures and the control males reared in normal winter temperatures across all annotated genes in the Ensembl stickleback genome assembly. Approximately 79 million of paired‐end reads were produced after sequencing for each sample, and 90% of them could be uniquely mapped to the reference genome. General statistics of mapping for each sample can be found in Table 
 <xref rid="eva12487-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>. Of 22456 genes, only those with nonzero total read count were considered for differential expression analyses (brain tissue: 
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 20,307 genes; liver tissue: 
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 18,781 genes). Our analyses revealed that 36 genes in the brain and 44 genes in the liver were differentially expressed between the control and warm‐treated fish at a level of adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; .05 (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12487-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Transcriptome results indicated a tissue‐specific regulation, and there was no similarly regulated gene between the brain and liver. There were more downregulated (i.e., lower expression in the warm‐treated fish compared with the controls) than upregulated genes in both tissues. Average log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fold changes in the upregulated and downregulated genes were 0.95 and −1.20 for brain, and 1.77 and −1.80 for liver. Relative change in transcript abundance of all genes and the list of DE genes with more information are provided in Fig.
