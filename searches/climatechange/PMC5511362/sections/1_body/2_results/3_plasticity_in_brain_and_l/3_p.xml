<p class="p">We present results from Gene Ontology (GO) and enrichment (g:GOSt) analyses using DE genes at a level of adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; .1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12487-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) but analyses including only those at adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; .05 gave similar results. In brain, the DE genes significantly represented biological process GO categories related with several metabolic processes, energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Mitochondrion cellular component and some molecular functions related with oxidoreductase activity and hormone activity were also significantly represented by the affected genes in brain transcriptome. Overall, these results suggested a regulation of genes related to metabolism in the brain of warm‐acclimated sticklebacks. The genes related to hormones (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">smtlb</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> pomca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">tshba</italic>) were the most differentially expressed in the brain (log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fold changes &lt; −2, Table 
 <xref rid="eva12487-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). In the liver transcriptome, there was no GO category significantly represented by the DE genes.
