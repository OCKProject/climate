<p class="p">Male sticklebacks that experienced warm winter temperatures were significantly smaller than the control individuals at the beginning of the breeding season (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12487-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a; Table 
 <xref rid="eva12487-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Standard length showed significant heritable variance, and there was a strong positive genetic correlation across environments (i.e., control and warm winter; Table 
 <xref rid="eva12487-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). This cross‐environment genetic correlation significantly differed from 0 and did not differ from 1, indicating that different genotypes showed a fixed plasticity (no G × E) in body size at sexual maturation in this stickleback population (see Fig.
