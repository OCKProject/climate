<p class="p">The control males expressed relatively larger red area, indicating a greater investment in nuptial coloration, at the beginning of their territorial phase compared to the warm‐treated males, whereas there was no difference in individual peak coloration between the treatment groups (Figure

 <xref rid="eva12487-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Both early and peak coloration showed significant genetic variance, and cross‐environment genetic correlations also indicated a fixed plasticity (no G × E) in these traits (Table
