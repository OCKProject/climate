<p class="p">Transcription of most candidate genes was significantly influenced by winter temperature treatment in the same pattern as the whole‐transcriptome results (Figure

 <xref rid="eva12487-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Genes involved in oxidation–reduction and ATP synthesis, 
 <italic class="italic">ND5</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ATP6</italic>, were upregulated in the brain tissue of the warm‐treated male sticklebacks, whereas genes related to thyroid (TH), somatolactin (SL) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) hormones, 
 <italic class="italic">tshba</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> smtlb</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">pomca</italic>, were downregulated. Another candidate gene 
 <italic class="italic">kdm7aa</italic> (lysine‐specific demethylase) was downregulated in the brain, but the difference between the treatment groups was not significant. In the liver, significant downregulation of membrane protein tetraspanin gene, 
 <italic class="italic">tspan13a</italic>, and ATP‐binding cassette gene, 
 <italic class="italic">abca2</italic>, and upregulation of transducing‐like enhancer gene, 
 <italic class="italic">tle3a</italic>, were observed. The expression of 
 <italic class="italic">apoba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cecr5</italic> in the liver did not significantly differ between the control and experimental sticklebacks.
