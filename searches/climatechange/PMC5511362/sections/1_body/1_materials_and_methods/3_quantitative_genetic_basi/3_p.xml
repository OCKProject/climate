<p class="p">To test whether the degree of phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature treatment varied across genotypes (G × E) by testing and estimating genetic correlations between the two thermal environments, we fit bivariate animal models to treatment group‐specific traits (see Kruuk,

 </sub>) and residual (ɛ

Because no individual belonged to both treatment groups (i.e., no single individual expressed a trait in both environments), residual covariance between the two groups was set to zero (Cov
 <sub class="sub">R</sub>
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>= 0). Additive genetic covariances and correlations between the control and warm‐treated males were estimated based on the pedigree included as a random effect in the bivariate models. The significance of additive genetic covariance was tested by LRT between the above model (i.e., with unconstrained genetic covariance) and a model with the covariance set to zero. To test for G × E, the unconstrained model was compared to a model in which genetic correlation between environments (control and warm winter) was fixed to one by LRT. This tests the hypothesis that the genetic correlation across environments is one (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">G</sub>
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>= 1); that is, different genotypes show the same level of plasticity (fixed plasticity) in response to winter temperature.
