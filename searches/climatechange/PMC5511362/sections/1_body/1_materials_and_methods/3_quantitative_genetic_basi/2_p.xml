<p class="p">Additive genetic variance and genotype‐by‐environment (temperature) interactions (G × E) in key life‐history traits of male sticklebacks (i.e., size at maturation, relative size of nuptial colour area in the early territorial period, and seasonal peak nuptial colouration) were tested using restricted maximum‐likelihood mixed models implemented in ASReml (version 3). We first estimated additive genetic variances in standard length and early and peak colorations in univariate animal models, including the overall trait mean (μ) and experimental treatment (control or warm winter scheme) as fixed effects and the additive genetic effect (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) based on the pedigree information (here, full‐sib and half‐sib relationships) and residual error (ɛ) as random effects. Growth tank‐specific common environment effect was initially included as an additional random effect, but it was removed from the models presented here because its variance was zero in all traits (

 <sub class="sub">C</sub>
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>= 0; likelihood ratio test (LRT), 
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>= 1). Thus, in each univariate model a trait (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) of an individual 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> was specified as:

 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>

 <italic class="italic">V</italic>

 <italic class="italic">F</italic> test. The significance of additive genetic variance was assessed by a LRT based on −2 × difference in log‐likelihood between the unconstrained model and a model with the variance component constrained to zero, which has one degree of freedom.
