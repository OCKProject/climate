<p class="p">The experimental manipulation of temperatures began in November 2013 when juvenile fish were about 6–7 months old (for details, see Kim et al.,

Half of the growth tanks were assigned to the control and the other half to the warm winter treatment to equally allocate individuals from the same family between the two treatments. Body mass of the juvenile fish did not differ between the two treatment groups prior to the temperature manipulation (ln‐transformed body mass at age 6 months; two‐tailed

Water temperature in the warm‐treated tanks was maintained at 14°C during winter, whereas the temperature in the control tanks was gradually reduced from 14°C in November to 9°C in January then increased to 14°C in March, simulating the natural seasonal pattern at the sampling site of the parent fish (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Some global warming scenarios predict an increase of 4–6°C in average winter water temperature in this latitude (Majone, Bovolo, Bellin, Blenkinsop, &amp; Fowler,
