<p class="p">Breeding design and rearing condition are fully described in a previous study (Kim &amp; Velando, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Three‐spined sticklebacks were captured as breeding stock in the River Ulla (Galicia, Spain) in February 2013. A total of 32 full‐sibling F1 families were obtained by crossing the wild sticklebacks (16 sires and 16 dams) during April–May. Each parent fish bred twice with two different mates in two independent spawning events. Thus, each F1 fish had maternal and paternal half‐siblings as well as full‐siblings. This breeding design allowed us to estimate narrow‐sense quantitative genetic parameters by generating half‐siblings with different (clutch‐specific) maternal and common environmental effects. The stickleback populations in Galicia are at the southern edge of the species’ European range, which extends from the Iberian peninsula and the Black Sea to the north coasts of Scotland, Ireland, Norway and up to Iceland (Makinen, Cano, &amp; Merila,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1963</xref>). In this annual population, sticklebacks reproduce more frequently throughout a single relatively long breeding season (late February–August) compared to more northern populations (Fernández et al.,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Fry in each full‐sib family were reared in two or four growth tanks of 8 L (
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 114 tanks), each initially housing 11 or 12 full‐siblings. Two fish per tank were subsequently removed at age 5 months for another experiment (Kim, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The natural seasonal photoperiod and temperature at the sampling site of the parent fish were simulated in the growth tanks by programmed illumination and flow‐through water cooling system (length of day: a maximum of 15 hr in June and a minimum of 9 hr in December; temperature: a maximum of 20°C in August and a minimum of 9°C in January). Juveniles from the 32 full‐sib families that survived until age 6 months were weighed and permanently marked with colour elastomer tags (Northwest Marine Technologies, Shaw Island, WA, USA) under a low dose of benzocaine anaesthetic to allow tracking of individual‐specific life histories (
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 1,038 individuals). Randomly selected fishes from the stock were sacrificed with an overdose of benzocaine anaesthetic prior to the manipulation of temperatures (
 <italic class="italic">n </italic>= 87 individuals of unknown sex) for a parallel study.
