<p class="p">For real‐time qPCR assays of candidate genes, the concentration of all the RNA samples from the 33 male sticklebacks was quantified using a Synergy HT (BioTek). Only 18 of the brain RNA samples were used for the analysis of candidate gene expression because the RNA concentration was not sufficiently high in the rest. First‐strand cDNAs were synthesized with qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences) using 500 ng of total RNA. The cDNA was stored at −20°C until qPCR analysis of candidate genes to validate the results of RNA‐seq (whole‐transcriptome analyses).</p>
