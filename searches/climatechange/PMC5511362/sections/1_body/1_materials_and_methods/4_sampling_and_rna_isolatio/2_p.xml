<p class="p">Randomly selected subsamples (18 control and 15 warm‐acclimated males) were sacrificed by an overdose of benzocaine anaesthetic in early February 2014 when the temperature difference between the control and warm winter groups was the maximum (9 and 14°C, respectively). The whole brain and liver from the 33 males were collected using nuclease free dissection instruments. Samples were embedded in 200 μl of RiboZol (Amresco) and tissues were homogenized using RNase‐free pellet pestles (Sigma‐Aldrich) until they were totally disaggregated. A volume of 800 μl of RiboZol was added to each homogenized sample to obtain a final volume of 1 ml per sample. The prepared samples were kept at −80°C until the isolation of RNA to ensure the RNA integrity. Total RNA was isolated following the RiboZol manufacturer's instructions. All samples were treated with DNase I to remove any contaminating DNA and the treated RNA was purified using the DNA‐Free RNA kit (Zymo Research).</p>
