<p class="p">Among the prepared RNA samples, brain and liver samples of six individuals from three different full‐sib families (a pair of experimental and control individuals per each family, thus three individuals per treatment) were haphazardly selected for transcriptome sequencing. The quantity and quality of the selected RNA samples were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) based on the values of RNA concentration, RNA integrity number (RIN) and rRNA ratio [28s/18s]. A total of 2 μg RNA from the selected samples were shipped to the Centre Nacional de Anàlisi Genòmica (CNAG; Barcelona;
