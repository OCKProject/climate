<p class="p">cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina (Solexa) pyrosequencing technology at the CNAG. Total RNA was assayed for quantity and quality using Qubit
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> RNA HS Assay (Life Technologies) and RNA 6000 Nano Assay on a Bioanalyzer 2100. From total RNA, the RNASeq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used as the input material for poly‐A based mRNA enrichment with oligo‐dT magnetic beads. After fragmentation (mRNA fragment size was 80–250nt, with the major peak at 130nt), the first‐ and second‐strand cDNAs were synthesized. The double‐stranded cDNA was end‐repaired, 3′adenylated and the 3′‐”T” nucleotide of the adapter was used for the Illumina indexed adapters ligation. The ligation product was enriched by 10 cycles of PCR.
