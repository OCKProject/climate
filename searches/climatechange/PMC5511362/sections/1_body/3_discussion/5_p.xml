<p class="p">In the liver transcriptome, there was no gene ontology category clearly represented in fish reared in warmer water. Although there is a conserved transcriptome phenotype across all tissues, different tissues can show highly divergent metabolic strategies that are likely related to their physiological role within the body (Logan &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the brain transcriptome, there were various metabolic processes represented by the DE genes. Brain is a metabolically expensive organ, and liver is the central organ that is involved in the maintenance of whole body energy homeostasis. Thus, living in warmer water may increase resting metabolic rate to different degrees in these organs as well as other energetically active tissues such as red muscle or result in a trade‐off in energy allocation among organs (Clarke &amp; Fraser, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Geluso &amp; Hayes, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Shama et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, we should not speculate about the metabolic strategy for liver tissue during warm acclimation based only on the transcriptomic results from fish sampled at the end of long‐term temperature manipulation. A study of zebrafish (
 <italic class="italic">Danio rerio</italic>) demonstrated that warm acclimation depleted energy stores in liver at the beginning, but then its condition recovered by physiological adjustments by the end of acclimation that lasted a month (Vergauwen, Benoot, Blust, &amp; Knapen, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this zebrafish study, interestingly, many transcripts involved in proteolysis were downregulated in the liver after a month of warm acclimation, suggesting that energy expenditure was reduced, whereas these transcripts were upregulated after cold acclimation, indicating compensation for the decreased metabolic rate (Vergauwen et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Although the RNA‐seq results were successfully validated for most candidate genes by real‐time qPCR, the failure in some other genes indicate that the whole‐transcriptome data from a limited number of samples should be interpreted with caution.
