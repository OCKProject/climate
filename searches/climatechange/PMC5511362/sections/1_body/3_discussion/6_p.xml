<p class="p">Accumulating evidence suggests that living in warmer temperatures than the conditions to which the species or population has adapted is energetically costly due to increased resting metabolic rate (Clarke,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Resting metabolic rate is often measured and interpreted as the energy cost of self‐maintenance, which is one of the most important life‐history components together with growth and reproduction (Burton et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Individuals must allocate limited resources among these competing functions (Stearns, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). The trade‐offs between self‐maintenance and other life‐history components mean that temperature‐induced changes in resting metabolic rate will probably have consequences for life‐history traits and hence fitness (Burton et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Overall, our whole‐transcriptome and candidate gene expression results showed that warm acclimation induces genomic changes in metabolic processes and hormone actions, particularly in the brain. The compulsory changes in metabolism during warm acclimation may call for physiological changes for homoeostasis. The costs of these physiological functions may have resulted in nonvariable life‐history reaction norm, causing all genotypes and individuals to express smaller body size at maturation and reduced nuptial colouration after warm acclimation as shown in our quantitative genetic results (see also Shama et al.,
