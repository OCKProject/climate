<p class="p">After long‐term exposure to increased winter temperatures, there were significant changes in the expression of some genes involved in metabolism, oxidative stress and endocrine signalling. In particular, genes responsible for several metabolic processes and oxidation–reduction were upregulated in the brain of the males reared under warm conditions. For example, genes related to mitochondrial enzyme complexes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., ATP synthase:

 <italic class="italic"> ATP8</italic>; NADH dehydrogenase: 
 <italic class="italic">ND1</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> ND4</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> ND5</italic>, cytochrome c oxidase: 
 <italic class="italic">COX3, COX6</italic>) were upregulated. The representation of metabolic processes by the DE genes in the warm‐acclimated fishes may reflect the energetic cost of living in warm temperatures (Clarke,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). High metabolic rate induced by warm temperatures may result in oxidative stress, especially when ventilation and circulation fail to cover tissue oxygen demand (Pörtner &amp; Farrell,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In agreement with our results, other studies have shown that chronic thermal stress induced consistent upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism, as well as those for cellular homoeostasis due to increased oxidative stress, in gill or liver of other fish species (Jeffries, Hinch, Sierocinski, Pavlidis, &amp; Miller,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In particular, it is interesting to note that the expression of genes involved in metabolism and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis matched the phenotypic patterns for mitochondrial respiratory capacity in a previous study of the three‐spined stickleback (Shama et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). These transcriptional changes during warm acclimation are probably not surprising because metabolic rate is often highly plastic in response to changing environmental conditions, including ambient temperature, in diverse taxa (Dillon, Wang, &amp; Huey, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lovegrove, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Norin, Malte, &amp; Clark, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A chronic increase in metabolic rate and oxidative stress may have negative impacts on fitness‐related traits (Burton, Killen, Armstrong, &amp; Metcalfe,
