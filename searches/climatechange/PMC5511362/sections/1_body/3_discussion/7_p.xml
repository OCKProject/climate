<p class="p">A number of current studies have proposed optimistic predictions that fitness may be maintained by adaptive plasticity in animal populations experiencing sustained climate change (Barrett &amp; Hendry,

 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, our experiment that simultaneously explored life‐history reaction norms and genomic responses of sticklebacks at the southern edge of their distribution suggests that changes in gene expression related to metabolism, homeostasis and signalling pathways may allow animals to cope with thermal stress but result in a fitness penalty due to the costs of phenotype in warmer environments. The lack of genetic variation in life‐history responses to temperature change may constrain any further evolutionary responses to climate change in the study population. Smaller body size at maturation and reduced investment in early reproduction were fixed responses of male sticklebacks to increased winter temperatures in this population that has adapted to live in the species’ upper thermal limit over evolutionary time. This may be an optimal strategy to persist in fluctuating thermal environments, but future warming may cause local extinction of the three‐spined stickleback due to its limited genetic variation in plasticity pattern. It will be interesting to study whether this population has the capacity to shift breeding sites or timing to avoid unfavourable temperatures. Future studies need to explore more about the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change at the molecular (including epigenetic), cellular and physiological levels to validate the role of phenotypic plasticity for the persistence of the species under continuing climate change across latitude.
