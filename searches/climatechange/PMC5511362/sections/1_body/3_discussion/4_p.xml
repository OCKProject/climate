<p class="p">Downregulated genes in the brain transcriptome included 
 <italic class="italic">tshba</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> smtlb</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">pomca</italic>, which are responsible for the secretion of TH, SL and POMC, respectively. TH is essential for larval metamorphosis in teleost fish, and its secretion is regulated by both external stimuli, such as temperature, photoperiod and olfactory cue, and internal stimuli, such as basal metabolism and growth (Blanton &amp; Specker, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Dufour &amp; Rousseau, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Since TH also regulates pelvic fin growth and pigmentation (Brown, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>), this hormone may be required for a stickleback to begin its reproduction (Blanton &amp; Specker, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). SL belongs to the growth hormone/prolactin family and regulates growth in teleost fish (Ono et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). During the period of gonadal growth, SL regulates some physiological aspect of reproduction, including the level of 11‐ketotestosterone, a fish androgen that mediates spermatogenesis, aggressive behaviour and parental behaviour (Rand‐Weaver, Swanson, Kawauchi, &amp; Dickhoff, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). Melanocortins, the product of POMC gene, involve energy expenditure and sexual activity when bound to melanocortin receptors in brain (Ducrest, Keller, &amp; Roulin, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In some teleost fish, 
 <italic class="italic">pomca</italic> (a paralog gene) is related to the neuroendocrine stress response and its expression is downregulated under chronic stress exposure (Wunderink et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Taken together, the significant representation of hormone activity by some DE genes suggests that warm prereproduction conditions probably suppress growth and early reproductive investment in male sticklebacks as supported by our results of life‐history plasticity (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12487-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). These results highlight that hormones should be the focus of more studies of phenotypic plasticity because they represent the interface between the external environment and the expression of other important phenotypes (Pigliucci, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>).
