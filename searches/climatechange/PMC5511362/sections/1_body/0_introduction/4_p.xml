<p class="p">Ecological studies of how climate change impacts animal populations are mainly focussed on ecologically important traits that directly affect population growth through their influence on life history (Chevin, Lande, &amp; Mace, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, it is also necessary to explore evolutionary mechanisms underlying temperature‐induced phenotypic plasticity to understand costs associated with plasticity and predict population persistence under future climate change. Life‐history changes in response to climate change may be a consequence of temperature‐induced responses at the physiological or molecular levels. In vertebrates, control systems translate environmental cues perceived by sense organs into molecular (neuroendocrine) signals that induce programmed responses in gene expression and physiology during development (Lessells, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Temperature change during development has both immediate and persistent effects on thermal acclimation capacity of ectotherm animals at the cellular and molecular levels of biological organization (Komoroske, Connon, Jeffries, &amp; Fangue, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Scott &amp; Johnston, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Shama et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tchernov et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Veilleux et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The ability of an individual to perceive thermal stress and cope physiologically with the challenge should have strong influences on its homoeostasis and survival. However, the energetic costs of this ability can compromise other life‐history components such as growth, immune function and reproduction, resulting in inevitable sublethal impacts (Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Indeed, a recent study of the three‐spined stickleback (
 <italic class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic> Linnaeus 1758) has shown that exposure to a simulated heat wave induced a long‐lasting immune disorder (Dittmar, Janssen, Kuske, Kurtz, &amp; Scharsack,
