<p class="p">Here, genetically related individuals originating from a wild stickleback population were reared in two environments that differed in thermal conditions (control vs. warm winter) prior to the reproductive season. We first explored G × E (i.e., variation in phenotypic responses of genotypes to different environments) of key life‐history traits in male sticklebacks exposed to long‐term temperature changes during winter by using a character‐state quantitative genetic approach (Merilä &amp; Hendry, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). By testing and estimating genetic correlations between the control and warm environments, representing the presence of G × E, we tested whether the level of phenotypic plasticity is variable among genotypes in this population. We expect the absence of such variation only if there is a single, potentially optimal plasticity pattern (i.e., optimal plasticity hypothesis), which has evolved as a fixed strategy in this population because the fitness benefits of plasticity exceed any cost of plasticity. Second, we studied gene expression plasticity during warm acclimation by analysing both whole‐transcriptome and candidate gene expression (Logan &amp; Buckley, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Based on widespread thermal reaction norm for metabolic rate phenotypes (i.e., temperature dependence of metabolism hypothesis), we expected that genes related to anaerobic respiration or oxidative stress would be upregulated in the warm‐treated sticklebacks compared to the control fishes reared in normal winter conditions. Moreover, the experimental fishes were expected to invest less in fitness‐related life‐history traits (e.g., smaller body size at maturation, reduced reproductive investment and shorter lifespan) if the molecular responses to increased temperature are energetically costly (costs of phenotype).
