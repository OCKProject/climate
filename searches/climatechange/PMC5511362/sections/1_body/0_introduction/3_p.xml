<p class="p">Different genotypes from the same population as well as different populations may vary in the level of their response to environmental conditions. This variation in plasticity can be detected and quantified by testing genotype‐by‐environment interaction (G × E). Although the optimal plasticity in which an organism produces an appropriate phenotypic response will increase its fitness, the rareness of this capacity in natural populations suggests that there are constraints on the evolution of plasticity (Murren et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Important constraints on the evolution of adaptive plasticity are costs of plasticity, which lead to decremented fitness in a highly plastic genotype relative to a less plastic genotype (Callahan, Maughan, &amp; Steiner, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; DeWitt, Sih, &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Ghalambor, McKay, Carroll, &amp; Reznick, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Fitness costs of plasticity may come in the form of maintenance of physiological machinery underlying plastic phenotypes. Here, it is important to distinguish costs of plasticity from costs of phenotype, which refers to the fitness trade‐offs due to allocation of resources to one trait versus another (Callahan et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Although an increasing number of empirical studies have reported developmental changes in behavioural or life‐history traits in response to sustained and consistent climate change and sought to understand the adaptive significance of such changes, relatively few studies have focussed on negative aspects of plasticity despite its importance for the fate of populations in a changing environment (Merilä &amp; Hendry, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
