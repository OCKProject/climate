<p class="p">There is increasing evidence that climate change is influencing biodiversity through increased extinction risk and altered geographical distribution for many species worldwide (Deutsch et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Thus, the responses of animals to climate change and associated fitness consequences have recently been the focus of ecological and evolutionary researches. The most important mechanisms by which an animal population can respond to climate change include population‐level evolutionary changes in response to thermal stress and individual‐level phenotypic plasticity (Barrett &amp; Hendry, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In particular, phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environments (Pigliucci, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), allows rapid responses to climate change compared to adaptive evolution. To be effective, phenotypic plasticity should be able to produce an adaptive response to an environmental cue in an appropriate and timely manner. For example, individual adjustment of egg‐laying date in response to the prelaying temperature has enabled a bird population to attain optimal reproductive timing, producing a better phenotype–environment match (Charmantier et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, increased temperatures often have negative impacts on fitness‐related traits of animals, particularly in populations at the current low‐latitude margins of species’ distribution (i.e., rear edge populations) that live near the species’ thermal limits (Somero, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Rear edge populations are more vulnerable in a changing environment than those from the centre (Vucetich &amp; Waite, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) because they are typically small and geographically isolated populations and tend to have reduced within‐population genetic diversity (Chang, Kim, Park, &amp; Maunder, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). These populations are particularly important for studying the survival and evolutionary adaptation of species under climate change because understanding their capacity for thermal acclimation will allow us to predict the effects of future climate on the species across its range (Hampe &amp; Petit, 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Razgour et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12487-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>).
