  <p class="p">Parasite traits and abiotic and biotic interactions leading to parasite vulnerability under climate change. We list the most important biological traits of parasites that could amplify their vulnerability to extinction under climate change, the most likely changes to hostâ€“parasite interactions and various mitigation strategies likely to be used by both parasites and hosts adapting to disrupted climates.</p>
