<p class="p">At the simplest level of adaptation, endoparasites are affected by climate change through the physical environment within their hosts. In the face of climate change, hosts capable of adapting to new temperatures may escape parasitic infection through ‘thermal refugia’ in which parasites can no longer viably persist. In many cases, this is not an issue of absolute tolerance limits, but instead of steady declines in fitness. Work by Ibelings

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] highlights that even highly virulent parasites can have upper thermal bounds above which hosts can escape infection, and while what they call the ‘warmer hence sicker world’ hypothesis is widespread in the literature, climate change can have a far more unpredictable effect on host–parasite dynamics.
