<p class="p">Finally, for parasites with free-living stages, environmental conditions most directly influence parasite survival, and the physiological responses of free-living stages to temperature changes may be a better predictor than any host traits. For example, excessively high temperatures can cause physiological stress in free-living parasites and thus mortality [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Alterations to rainfall patterns, and thus water availability, could be detrimental, particularly for those parasites that require inundation to complete life cycles or moisture to facilitate environmental survival and transmission. Pickles

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] found that while temperature of the coldest month of the year was the most important variable for determining the distribution of North American white-tailed deer (
 <italic class="italic">Odocoileus virginianus</italic>), the definitive host for the meningeal parasitic worm (
 <italic class="italic">Parelaphostrongylus tenuis</italic>), precipitation in the warmest quarter was the most important variable for determining the distribution of the free-living 
 <italic class="italic">P. tenuis</italic> larvae. Consequently, we argue that the first step in identifying vulnerable parasites is to profile endoparasitic fauna with both free-living stages and large-bodied poikilothermic definitive hosts (e.g. crocodilians or elasmobranchs).
