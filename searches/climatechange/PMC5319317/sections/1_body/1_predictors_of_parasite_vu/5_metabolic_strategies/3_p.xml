<p class="p">The relationship between host and parasite thermal ecology is complicated by trade-offs between host adaptation and immunity, which varies directly with both body size and form of thermal homeostasis (i.e. homeothermy versus poikilothermy). Parasites in homeothermic hosts may benefit from external temperature fluctuations; homeotherms may expend more energy to maintain internal temperature within the optimal part of their performance curves, limiting their immune resource expenditure for anti-parasite defences and reactions [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Conversely, parasites of poikilothermic hosts may be more vulnerable to fluctuating temperatures (see electronic supplementary material, figureÂ S1), because poikilothermic internal temperature changes widely with environmental temperature, but coevolutionary processes may already drive a matching degree of eurythermality between hosts and parasites. However, as illustrated by experiments on antimicrobial responses to chytrid fungus (

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and this would probably ultimately be to the benefit of parasites in poikilothermic hosts. Thus, the higher extinction rate that poikilothermic vertebrates like reptiles and amphibians are generally assumed to face may not be matched by primary extinction risk for parasites, and other traits (like the ones we describe in other sections below) will be more suitable within-clade predictors of parasite vulnerability.
