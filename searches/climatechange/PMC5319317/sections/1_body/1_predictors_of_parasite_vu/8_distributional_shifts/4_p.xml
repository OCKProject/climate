<p class="p">The biogeographic shifts that drive mismatch in host–parasite associations may be matched by changes in the internal host environment, caused by autonomous host–environment interactions. The combined process is complex and potentially unpredictable: by way of example, we present a hypothetical parasite with an intermediate and definitive host and a free living stage, all experiencing a warmer, drier climate (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Each species occupies a fundamental niche in what Hutchinson called the ‘biotope’—the complex multidimensional environmental space that is sampled on real landscapes. Geographical range shifts are merely a consequence of species tracking the shifting biotope, but under climate extremes, some parts of species' niches become entirely unavailable. Because parasites exist at the intersection of each host's niche and that of their free living stage, minor loss of area in each can compound to significantly contract the parasite's distribution. But, as hosts move and experience warmer, more-inhospitable environments, their immune resistance may be lowered [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], their hosts may support a higher overall level of infection in that smaller range. This may provide a net benefit to parasites, especially those with the evolutionary ability to bypass dependence on intermediate stages. Of parasites with complex multi-stage life cycles, those that are capable of truncating their life cycle complexity suffer the least competitive disadvantage [
