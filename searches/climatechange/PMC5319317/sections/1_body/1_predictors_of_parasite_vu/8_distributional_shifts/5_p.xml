<p class="p">As one final note, we caution that host–parasite mismatch can occur temporally as well as spatially, an axis of variation not presented in the electronic supplementary material, figure S1. Niche models projected under climate change scenarios forecast phenological mismatches between host and parasites when geographical shifts occur at different rates [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] projected shifts in the distribution of

 <italic class="italic">Odocoileus virginianus</italic>) with an intermediate gastropod host. Despite increases of niche breadth for each species, temporal mismatches in habitat suitability arose between life cycle stages, reducing parasite persistence. As this example and other cases of temporal mismatch illustrate [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], parasite vulnerability to extinction is compounded by each additional life stage or required intermediate host, with each needing independent consideration (see [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]). In fact, by simulating the sequential and random extinction of every component of both theoretical and empirical food webs, Lafferty [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] found that increasing the number of life cycle stages by one in a model system negated the added robustness to extinction that would be provided by an additional 12 suitable hosts, highlighting that complex life cycles have a much more readily noticed effect on extinction risk than host specificity.
