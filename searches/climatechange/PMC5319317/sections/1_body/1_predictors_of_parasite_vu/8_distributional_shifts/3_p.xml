<p class="p">If too few parasites migrate with their hosts, parasite density in the new habitat may be too low to maintain occupancy [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]; indeed, an increasing body of literature suggests that parasite range shifts may lag behind host range shifts [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], though this phenomenon is not limited to host–parasite interactions [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. For example, Hopper 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] found that a large marine snail (
 <italic class="italic">Kelletia kelletii</italic>) that had expanded its range northward along the coast of California due to climate change was 20% less likely to be parasitized in this new territory, and harboured only 14% of the parasite species found in snails in its historical range. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 26 host species across several phyla that had experienced range expansions, Torchin 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] found that the parasite richness in native populations was at least twice that found in hosts with climate-facilitated range shifts. Unpublished work by Carlson 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> further confirms that parasites are likely to face substantial range loss in a changing climate, regardless of the possibility of host switching, to the point that one in 10 species could be directly threatened with primary extinction (data available at pearl.berkeley.edu).
