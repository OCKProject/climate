 <xref rid="RSOS160535C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] examined 17 species of migratory birds and six species of ticks, and found that these birds, through changing migration patterns, transported at least two tick species (

 <italic class="italic">Haemaphysalis concinna</italic>) that had not been found previously at the migratory stopover sites. However, parasites with complex life cycles may fail in colonization if changes to host distributions shift or migration routes take them to areas with suboptimal or lack of suitable hosts at any stage, or with intolerable environmental conditions for free-living stages.
