<p class="p">In a framework where specialism is the primary driver of coextinctions, a combination of data on host susceptibility to primary extinction and parasites' host specificity may appear the best predictor of parasite extinction risk [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. However, current parasite ecology literature makes mixed predictions on whether generalist or specialist parasites face higher extinction risks. Generalist parasites are capable of exploiting more than one, often several, host taxa, while specialists have co-adapted closely to their hosts and are dependent on one or two phylogenetically closely related host taxa for their development and survival. At first glance, specificity should drive coextinction, a finding easily shown with theoretical models [

A theoretical food web alteration study found that specialist trematodes in a southern Californian marsh food web were very sensitive to secondary extinctions due to the fact that 64% of these parasites depended on a single host species during at least one of those stages. In 18% of the theoretical scenarios in this study, the extinction of a free-living host species led to the secondary extinction of a parasite, with extinctions of the snail host

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Strict host specificity also often means that a smaller number of suitable hosts are available at any stage in the life cycle, and specialists on unstable host populations should face the highest extinction risk [
