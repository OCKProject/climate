<p class="p">At high enough host extinction levels, generalists may face comparable or higher extinction rates than specialists, as in island ecosystems after the arrival of humans, where generalist ectoparasites went extinct with approximately 70â€“80 related bird host species [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study exploring the distribution of single versus multi-host parasites found that threatened ungulate species harboured a higher proportion of specialist parasites than non-threatened ungulate species, perhaps due to less frequent interactions between host species as their abundances decline [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. However, this relationship between extinction risk and parasite specificity did not manifest in carnivore species, a result that others have emphasized as indicating that parasite losses may be a purely stochastic process [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Debate about the interpretation of these findings is ongoing [
