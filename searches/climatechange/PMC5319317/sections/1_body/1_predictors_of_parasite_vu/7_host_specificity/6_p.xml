<p class="p">Any framework for parasite extinction risk based on specialism also has to acknowledge that parasites that can adapt to novel hosts, or expand geographically into regions with stable hosts, will be far less prone to coextinction (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], some parasites may appear as functional specialists or ‘faux specialists’ [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. When faux specialists encounter changing environments in their native range or novel environments when their ranges shift, species with the necessary potential for adaptation undergo a process of host-switching that the ‘Stockholm paradigm’ of parasitology terms

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], relies on a combination of three baseline processes: phenotypic plasticity of genetically coded traits, correlated trait integration which allows rapid multidimensional phenotypic shifts, and phylogenetic conservatism of traits that offer ‘latent potential’. Together these engender an untapped potential for persistence in ‘sloppy fitness space’ after host extinction, or after misalignment of phenology or distribution between hosts and parasites.
