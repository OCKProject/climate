<p class="p">However, the specificity–coextinction relationship is far more complex on closer observation. The most significant disconnect between specificity and extinction risk can be attributed to the non-independence of host extinctions. Strona

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] found that the most specialized fish parasites had a lower coextinction risk than did more generalist fish parasite groups, probably because specialism is favoured as an evolutionary strategy on hosts with less demographic stochasticity. If parasites are associated with several closely related host species (e.g. multiple hosts in a single genus), covariance of extinction drivers between phylogenetic kin can produce comparable extinction outcomes [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Finally, specialist helminths are often very well-represented within their host communities, whereas generalists are usually considerably less abundant in an ecosystem (i.e. lower intensity of infection in a single host) [
