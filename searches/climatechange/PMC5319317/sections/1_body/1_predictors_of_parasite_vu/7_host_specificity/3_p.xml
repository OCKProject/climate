<p class="p">Finally, specialist parasites require an evolutionary host switch to colonize a new host, whereas generalist parasites by definition have already crossed multiple host-species barriers [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]; host switching is time costly, with rapidity dependent on factors such as host group size and host and parasite spatial overlap [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Other studies have found that host switching may not be the primary factor determining parasite extinction, and that generalist parasites may be less vulnerable than specialists by resisting extinction in other ways such as evolving more quickly to avoid host immune defences [
