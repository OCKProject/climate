<p class="p">As is characteristic of most invertebrates, the sizeable fraction of undescribed or unstudied parasite species [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] has, generally, prevented the same sorts of comprehensive vulnerability risk assessments for parasites that have been attempted for a subset of free-living macrobiota (i.e. PREDICTS database [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]). Geographic distributions and population size are the most reliable predictors of climate-induced extinction risk for many IUCN Red Listed free-living species [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], but these data are lacking for most parasite species. To guide the development of conservation efforts that include parasites [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], we outline important biological traits of parasites that affect their success in the face of climate change (summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160535F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). We consider four major mechanisms by which climate change will influence the persistence odds of parasites, and for each mechanism, our approach seeks to go beyond identifying basic drivers of parasite vulnerability and instead proposes a series of testable hypotheses to identify parasites that will thrive or suffer under climate change:
