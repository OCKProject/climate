<p class="p">While large vertebrate hosts may hold the majority of parasite diversity, they are also more likely to adapt slowly to climate change [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], and greater body size is conventionally associated with higher extinction risk [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]; larger hosts may thus be more likely to suffer primary extinction and simultaneously lose their parasites [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. While we recognize that host body size is only a proxy for parasite vulnerability, the fact that larger-bodied wildlife species face a higher risk of extinction [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] recommends such a metric for pragmatic reasons.
