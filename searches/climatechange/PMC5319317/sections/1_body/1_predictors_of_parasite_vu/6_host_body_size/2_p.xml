<p class="p">Larger hosts often harbour a greater richness of endoparasites (as shown by some work in ungulates [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]), as they have more available niches, tend to have longer lifespans and have metabolic traits (e.g. greater overall energetic reserves that support the high cost of maintaining more parasites and that make them less dependent on steady and constant food availability), that together make them a potentially more stable, long-term parasite habitat. Larger host species also tend to have higher energetic requirements matching the high costs of maintaining more parasites [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The more stable internal environment of larger hosts also supports higher host specificity [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], a trait already associated with the higher proportional richness due to the asymmetric nature of host–parasite webs (i.e. specialist parasites favour hosts with greater parasite diversity, a finding that is similarly robust in plant–pollinator and other association networks) [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Consequently, evidence suggests larger hosts are likely to host a greater overall richness of more specialized endoparasites, a finding confirmed across different groups, e.g. metazoan parasites of carnivores [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and fish [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Though some individual studies on ectoparasites like fleas have sometimes failed to find the same pattern (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]), other studies including all parasites of mammals, including microparasites like viruses, found a similar body size–richness scaling pattern [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>].
