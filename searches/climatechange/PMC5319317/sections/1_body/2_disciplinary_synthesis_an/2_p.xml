<p class="p">After identifying the biological traits that may affect parasite success under climate change and that can guide the prioritization of parasite conservation, we highlight some of the most important unanswered questions for a handful of disciplines regarding what influence climate change may have on parasite vulnerability to extinction. We stress that climate change science and planning for macrobiota conservation is by its nature interdisciplinary and will have valuable contributions to our knowledge about parasite extinction vulnerability, and that the identification of critical data gaps will often need to come from within each field. Telling the difference between a near-extinction parasite and a near-emergent pathogen will probably require answering the following questions.</p>
