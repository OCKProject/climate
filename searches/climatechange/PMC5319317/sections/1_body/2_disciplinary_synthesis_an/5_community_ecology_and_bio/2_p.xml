<p class="p">It remains unclear in the literature whether there are spatial hotspots of parasite biodiversity, but the ability to identify parasite-rich ecosystems could help tailor parasite conservation schemes on a global scale. From the few existing parasite biodiversity studies, there is evidence for such a host–parasite correlation in biodiversity, e.g. areas with higher bird and mammal diversity appear to have a higher diversity of human parasites [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Host specificity also may be more variable between ecosystem types than previously thought; for example, the strictness of fish parasite host specificity is different between marine, limnetic and riparian systems [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We suggest that identifying parasite biodiversity hotspots—and testing whether these correspond to hotspots of extinction risk—represents a critical contribution to parasite vulnerability research from macroecologists.
