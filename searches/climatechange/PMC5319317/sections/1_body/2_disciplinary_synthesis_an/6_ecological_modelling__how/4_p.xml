<p class="p">Population dynamic and compartmental epidemiological models may also be implemented to help identify vulnerable parasite taxa. For example, a susceptible–infected–resistant (SIR) model for trypanosomiasis that included both vectors and hosts predicted a potentially shifting parasite spatial range [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] projected the potential collapse of trematode–amphipod dynamics in the North Atlantic and in coastal New Zealand, respectively, using models that linked transmission rate to temperature. Population dynamic models trained on real data have the added benefit of being sensitive to the transmission dynamics of the parasites chosen for the model, as a wide range of potential transmission functions can be added to fit the system's characteristics [
