<p class="p">Most of the current modelling has been focused on extrapolating parasite biodiversity loss from corresponding host risk by using theoretical community models; such research has thus far indicated that specialist parasites and hosts at high trophic levels are the least robust to perturbation [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]). The use of species distribution modelling has somewhat improved these analyses, but the majority of these studies have been directed only at reservoir and vector species for human diseases, representing a similar bias to the overall parasite–climate interaction literature (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160535F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). The simplest of these studies model the potential distribution of parasites independent of their hosts, overestimating parasite distributions and thereby not accounting for the loss of suitable range at each level of host–parasite interactions (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
