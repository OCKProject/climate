<p class="p">Mechanistic species distribution models (similar to [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]) have the potential to address some of these challenges and are particularly suited to include dispersal limitations for both hosts and pathogens. However, these models are particularly data-intensive, and first require experiments to establish the physiological limits of a parasite species through the entire life cycle [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. This has already been done with some success for models of 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Angiostrongylus</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>], although these models have received criticism for combining data from different species to fill data gaps [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. Building a seasonal component into distribution models of both host and parasite species is also important given the critical role phenology plays in the persistence of parasite species [
