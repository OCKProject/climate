 <xref rid="RSOS160535C88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>], but for parasitic species, both within-host density and host density thresholds may exist that predict population persistence [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, the host population dynamics needed to maintain parasite species in the face of environmental change are not well understood. While a number of vector-borne parasites have strong density-driven vector–parasite associations (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]), not all parasite population dynamics is as easily predicted by that of their hosts. Wood 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] found that marine parasites with long free-living larval stages could disperse more widely and were thus less affected by nearby host density, suggesting that parasites with broader host ranges and/or the ability to disperse farther may have transmission rates that are less tightly coupled to host density. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the interaction between spatio-temporal dispersion, host density and transmission rates for parasites on land. It would not be surprising to find similar effects, however, given the fact that these larvae on land (e.g. helminth larvae) travel short distances and survive for only one to two weeks during their free-living development [
