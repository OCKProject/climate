<p class="p">Most data linking host infection and parasite life history outside of human diseases have been gathered from fish parasites [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], offering only an incomplete basis for extinction risk estimates in most taxa. As vulnerability to extinction will probably be distributed unevenly across clades, we argue that host phylogenies can fill knowledge gaps in the biology of poorly sampled parasites. Poulin 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] found some evidence of phylogenetic clustering of host–parasite ‘hotspots’ (host taxa capable of supporting a diverse array of parasite species) and ‘coldspots’ (host taxa relatively depauperate in parasite species richness) for mammalian, bird and fish hosts. These types of non-random patterns of diversity will ultimately determine the situational relevance of phylogenetic data and methods to the prediction of extinction risk. In general, phylogenetically closely related and ecologically similar hosts tend to have similar parasite assemblages [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>], and phylogenetic diversity of a host clade is associated with higher parasite species richness within individual hosts [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Even for understudied parasite systems, host phylogeny can fill in knowledge gaps to help develop conservation priorities, especially in cases where phylogenetic data act as sufficient proxy for a host's ecological and immunological characteristics.
