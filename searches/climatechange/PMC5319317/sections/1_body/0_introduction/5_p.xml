<p class="p">That loss of parasite biodiversity may have cascading effects in resource–consumer webs, and change the productivity and stability of ecosystems in unpredictable ways [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] that are often overlooked in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160535F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). Some estimate that up to 70% of all animal species are parasites [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], making parasitism the most common consumer strategy on Earth [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and parasites account for a significant portion of biomass [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and up to 78% of food web links [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] in any given ecosystem. Their presence and diversity has also been suggested as an indicator of ecosystems with a low degree of human degradation [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In addition, evolutionary specializations like host behaviour modification can increase biomass flow between free-living hosts up to 20-fold [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], while adaptations like host castration can drastically limit host population size [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Recent research has also highlighted that within-host interactions and competition between parasites can dilute disease risk for hosts in counterintuitive ways [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. As demonstrated in the 
 <italic class="italic">Ribeiroia</italic> trematode–amphibian experimental system [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], parasite and host biodiversity can dilute both disease risk and parasite-induced host mortality at the population level. Just as decreasing diversity in free-living species often increases the dominance of the most abundant species, parasite extinctions could have unpredictable effects on the structure of disease communities, as some pathogens could experience competitive release as rare species go extinct.
