<p class="p">The importance of parasites in these ways is well established, and now, as Strona [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] directs in a recent review, we must consider what happens when parasites vanish. We anticipate the parasite biodiversity loss, and associated downstream ecosystem consequences, may be a significant crisis of planning for conservation. While Dougherty 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] highlight the methods for conserving known vulnerable parasites, the 300 000 species of helminths alone pose a significant problem of triage [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. With the exception of three species (
 <italic class="italic">Hematopinus oliveri</italic>, the pygmy hog louse; 
 <italic class="italic">Acizzia veski</italic>, Vesk's plant louse; and 
 <italic class="italic">Hirudo medicinalis</italic>, the medicinal leech), no other parasite species have been included in the IUCN Red List. Parasites are not unique in this respect [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], as IUCN assessments had only covered 0.3% of invertebrate diversity in 2007, and the same data deficiencies have continued to limit risk assessments over the last decade [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. By 2015, the IUCN estimates that less than 0.1% of contemporary animal species have already gone extinct, but accounting for poorly documented groups that figure is probably closer to 7%, highlighting the severity of data deficiencies in invertebrate conservation [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Identifying traits that most predispose parasites to climate-driven extinction, separate from their hosts, would provide conservation a much needed framework for risk assessment that is robust and applicable across major parasitic groups.
