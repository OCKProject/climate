<p class="p">Rapidly changing climates are widely recognized as a major contributor to the sixth mass extinction event in Earth's history [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], and the potential impacts on ecosystem form and function are severe and likely to be irreversible [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. With estimates of up to 54% of free-living species eventually committed to extinction [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], the fate of parasites remains uncertain, despite significant research profiling climate-driven biodiversity loss since the turn of the century. Like most invertebrate species [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], parasites are poorly catalogued in biodiversity risk assessments, which are often biased towards the conservation of more charismatic vertebrates [
