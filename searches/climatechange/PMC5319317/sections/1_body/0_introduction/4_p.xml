<p class="p">Moreover, coextinction is only a fraction of the total vulnerability parasites face. Some species go extinct before their hosts or concurrent with host population decline (e.g.

 <italic class="italic">Gymnogyps californianus</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]). But as we highlight here, some parasites might experience decline due to the direct pressures of climate change, entirely separate from hosts. Like all multicellular organisms, parasites have an ecological niche that includes climatic constraints to survival and reproduction. Among many examples in the literature, which we highlight throughout the rest of the paper, the geographical boundaries and ecology of ectoparasites can be affected by aridity [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], elevation and cold [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], while endoparasites can be affected by precipitation, soil type, temperature and other variables [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. A changing climate alters the availability of parasite niche space, driving a combination of habitat loss and range shifts, and potentially decreasing population growth and reproductive rates, all potentially encouraging primary extinctions.
