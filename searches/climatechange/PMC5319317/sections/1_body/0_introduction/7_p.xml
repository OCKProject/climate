<p class="p">In this review, we highlight the aspects of parasite biology that make this (polyphyletic) category of organisms particularly vulnerable to extinction resulting from climate change, and identify biological traits of parasite species that may act as important predictors of different outcomes under climate change (summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160535F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). Those hypotheses are loosely focused on helminth endoparasites, but are also readily applicable in many cases to other parasitic groups (e.g. in discussions of host specificity or free-living stages). Many of our results come from theoretical work (which is often applicable across different forms of parasitism) or generalized patterns in the literature, and has enabled us to identify what we believe are testable and falsifiable hypotheses. As Houlahan

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] note in a recent and incredibly valuable review of the role of prediction in ecology, ‘A hallmark of ecological research is that we test coarse hypotheses that have relatively low information content’. With the relationship between climate change and the many aspects of parasite biology we cover here often unexplored for various clades, we focus on these generalized, testable hypotheses, which can be refined and tailored to the incredible diversity of parasitic life on Earth. We also outright acknowledge the massive data deficiencies characterizing many parasite species and clades. Thus, in addition to our framework, we devote the final section of our paper to identifying the major missing links within each discipline that are needed to build an interdisciplinary parasite conservation toolbox.
