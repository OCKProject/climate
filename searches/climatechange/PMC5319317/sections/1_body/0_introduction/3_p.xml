<p class="p">When parasites are considered in the climate change literature, the majority of studies focus on virulent pathogens that could become dominant in a changing climate, raising human health concerns [

 <xref rid="RSOS160535C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]; but the majority of parasites have no direct effect on human health, and the potential negative impacts of climate change on most wildlife parasites are, by and large, empirically untested. Macroparasites, which we focus on here, are already uniquely sensitive to secondary extinctions; theoretical work suggests that parasite vulnerability may be 10 times higher than the baseline extinction rate of their hosts due to the diversity of parasites relative to their hosts and the high potential for secondary and tertiary extinctions [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Consequently, the high extinction rate vertebrates face under climate change should be matched by an accompanying mass coextinction, but that phenomenon is poorly documented at best [
