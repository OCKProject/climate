<p class="p">We currently lack the necessary information to help us set conservation goals for most parasites: data on species distributions, diversity, phylogeny, host associations and even basic biology remains sparse for many parasites and make comprehensive assessments especially difficult. We propose a functional trait approach to target the most threatened and understudied parasite groups. With enough data, techniques such as machine learning methods can maximize the use of limited phylogenetic and ecological data in the identification of the most vulnerable parasite species in poorly studied, high-diversity clades (similar to those used by Obsomer 
 <italic class="italic">etÂ al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]). Of course, these methods, like any other, abide by the garbage-in garbage-out principle [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>], whereby analysis of limited data may result in highly biased (though potentially statistically supported) determinations of vulnerability. In a more immediate sense, species-specific parasite vulnerability assessments should be focused where the highest compounded risks are expected.
