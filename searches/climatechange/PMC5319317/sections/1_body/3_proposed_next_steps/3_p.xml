<p class="p">One final challenge to mainstreaming parasites into conservation involves determining how to implement conservation plans that include endangered parasites. The lack of motivation in preserving parasite diversity is a product of both the extensive challenges inherent in studying parasites and the traditional push toward eradication of parasitic organisms from endangered and commercially valued hosts as well as to reduce human risks (e.g. eradication of the smallpox and rinderpest viruses, and of the guinea worm, 
 <italic class="italic">Dracunculus medinensis</italic>). The difficulty associated with eradicating human parasitic diseases may speak to the underlying adaptability and plasticity of the parasitic life cycle, but we caution that the average wildlife parasite lacks the reliable, dense, and widespread host population a human disease like dracunculiasis has. While proposing how to adapt the current paradigms used for free-living fauna conservation to parasite conservation is beyond the scope of this review (see [
 <xref rid="RSOS160535C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]), we stress that parasites are not necessarily covered by the classic focus of conservation biology. Additionally, the ethics that guide which species' extinctions receive priority remains open to discussion. However, without further intervention, a rapidly changing climate will drive the loss of parasite diversity with profound ramifications across scales from individual hosts to ecosystems.
