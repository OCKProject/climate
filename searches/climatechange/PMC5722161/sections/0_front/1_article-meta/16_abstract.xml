  <p class="p">An 81-year-old male of good socioeconomic status living in the state of Michigan in the United States, presented to the eye clinic with a painful red left eye. He had not traveled outside of the state of Michigan in over three years. He was found to have a 7 cm long subconjunctival roundworm, which was ultimately extracted.</p>
