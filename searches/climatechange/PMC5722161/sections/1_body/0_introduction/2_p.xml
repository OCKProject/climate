<p id="p0010" class="p">This is a rare case of ophthalmic dirofilariasis in an 81-year-old man with sudden pain in the left eye. The nematode was located subconjunctivally and recognized as dirofilariasis. This case occurred in an unusual geographic location, in Michigan, U.S.A, which ultimately may be due to global climatic changes toward warmer temperatures.</p>
