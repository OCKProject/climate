<p id="p0020" class="p">Commonly known as the dog heartworm, Dirofilaria is a genus of nematodes, or roundworms, endemic to Mediterranean countries. The life cycle of Dirofilaria species relies on a vector, commonly mosquitos, for the “Larvae 3” or L3 stage, as well as a definitive vertebrate hosts, typically canine and feline species. Humans can rarely become hosts, predominantly with pulmonary and cardiac involvement, however ocular dirofilariasis has been reported subconjunctivally, intravitreally, and intraorbitally with the two notable species

 </xref> In recent years, incident rates of animal infections have increased. Although most Dirofilaria infections worldwide occur in tropic and subtropical locations, our unique case shows a trend of migration towards more northern areas typically devoid of such vector-borne parasites. The temperature in Michigan has risen nearly 2° Fahrenheit since 1980 and the northern hemisphere was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years, which may allow more incubation time for the L3 stage that develops only at temperatures above 57 °F for a long enough duration for infectious maturity.
