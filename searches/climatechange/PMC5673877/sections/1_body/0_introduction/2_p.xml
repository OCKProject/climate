<p id="Par8" class="p">We have studied the problem using ensembles of numerical simulations, which is a standard approach to investigating the possible outcomes of hypothetical oil spills (see e.g. Price et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2003</xref>; Guillen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2004</xref>). Ensemble simulations are commonly used in the planning phase of new petroleum developments, and serve two goals: First, to provide the probabilities of for example beaching of oil, for a further Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) where potential damage to natural resources will be considered, and second, to inform contingency planning for oil spill response, giving guidance on required amounts and distribution of response equipment (Barker and Healy
