<p id="Par38" class="p">The normalised cross-correlations are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. In calculating the correlations, the environmental inputs have been averaged over the 15 days of each simulation. Thus, if the cross-correlation between, e.g. the amount of stranded oil and the ice cover is calculated, then 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> is the amount of stranded oil at the end of simulation 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> is the average ice cover at the release location during the 15 days of simulation 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>. Note again that for the Finnmark scenario, the ice cover is always 0, and for the Svalbard scenario, the ice cover is always 0 in the future, and hence the correlations with ice cover will be 0 in these cases.
