 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> (left), an example of the development of the mass balance is shown for one's realisation of the Finnmark scenario. We see how the oil is released at a constant rate over 3 days, reaching a total of 15 000 metric tons. Evaporation and biodegradation are continuously ongoing processes, while we note that a significant fraction of the oil hits shore after about 5 days. At the end of the 15-day simulation, 33% of the oil has evaporated, 2% is at the surface, 7% is submerged, 13% has been biodegraded, 43% has stranded and 2% has ended up in the sediments. It should be mentioned that this simulation is the worst case from the Finnmark scenario, with respect to amount of stranded oil.
