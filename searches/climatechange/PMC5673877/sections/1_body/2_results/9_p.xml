<p id="Par36" class="p">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, we show the mean, the standard deviation and the 95-percentile for the amount of biodegraded oil, oil on the surface and stranded oil, as well as the total area of the surface slick, for all six scenarios, and separately for the present and the future. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, we note that the difference between summer and winter in the present seems to be much larger than the difference between the present and the future. In order to investigate the effect of ice cover in determining the seasons, we can categorise each simulation in the ensembles as “winter” if the ice coverage is above 70% at the release location at the start of the release, and as “summer” if the ice coverage is below 30%. This split will then allow us to construct the empirical distributions for the summer and winter data separately, and compare between present and future. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the empirical distributions are shown for amount of biodegraded, surface and stranded oil in all scenarios, split into winter and summer as described above. Note that in the Finnmark scenario, there is no ice, neither in the present or in the future, and in the Svalbard scenario, there is no ice in the future scenarios, and consequently no points are classified as winter.
