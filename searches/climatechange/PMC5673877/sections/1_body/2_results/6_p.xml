<p id="Par33" class="p">In addition to average values, another way of presenting the results of an ensemble of simulation is as a time series showing the amount of oil in an environmental compartment at the end of a simulation, as a function of the start time of that simulation. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> (top row), this is shown for amount of biodegraded oil and amount of oil in the sediment, for the Svalbard scenario. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, we see that in the future scenarios (2050–2053), there is always open water at the release location of the Svalbard case, while in the present scenarios, there is high ice cover roughly from January to the end of May, with some variation among the years. Clearly, the presence of ice coincides with the onset of a completely different behaviour in the time series for the present shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. We note also that the behaviour in the ice-free season seems quite similar for the present and the future.
