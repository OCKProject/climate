<p id="Par29" class="p">Furthermore, some aggregated quantities from each simulation are available as time series. These include amounts of evaporated oil, oil on the sea surface, submerged oil, oil on the shore, oil in the sediment and amount of oil which has been biodegraded. These six quantities make up the mass balance, and give information about the fraction of the total released mass which is found in any given “environmental compartment”. During the development of a spill, oil can move between compartments: Oil on the surface can be mixed down by waves and submerged, submerged oil can resurface, stranded oil can be washed out to sea, etc. The exception is that evaporated or biodegraded oil is removed from the simulation. Note that oil which is trapped at the ice/water interface under sea ice is included in the “surface” compartment.</p>
