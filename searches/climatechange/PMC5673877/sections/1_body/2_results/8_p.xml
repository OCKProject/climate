<p id="Par35" class="p">Since the distributions vary, a more complete way of displaying the results of the ensemble simulation is to consider the empirical distribution of each endpoint. In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> (bottom row), the distributions for amount of biodegraded oil, and amount of oil in the sediments, are shown for the Svalbard scenario, both as a histogram and as an empirical cumulative probability distribution, and separately for the present and the future. Note how the amount of biodegraded oil exhibits a bi-modal distribution in the present, due to a different behaviour when there is ice, and note also how the two endpoints (biodegraded and sediment) display completely different distributions.
