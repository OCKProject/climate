<p id="Par31" class="p">The goal of this study is to investigate how the footprint of a “typical” oil spill will change with a warmer climate. In order to obtain statistical results, we have chosen to consider the amount of oil in the six environmental compartments only, e.g. considering the amount of oil on the shore, without reference to exactly where that oil has beached. For the further analysis in this study, we will only use the data at the end of each simulation, corresponding to day 15 in the left panel of Fig.
