<p id="Par34" class="p">As was recently shown (Nordam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2016</xref>), the amounts of oil in the different compartments exhibit different probability distributions. In particular, the amount of stranded oil and oil in the sediment seem to follow some variety of a fat-tailed distribution. Consequently, average values may be of little use, or even misleading, and applying intuition from Gaussian distributions can cause severe underestimation of the probable worst-case scenario. As an extreme example, consider the amount of stranded oil in the present time in the Greenland II scenario: The 95-percentile (the amount which is such that in 95% of cases, the amount is less than this) is 1 metric ton, the 99-percentile is 83 tons and the 99.9-percentile is 1317 tons. For a Gaussian distribution of the same mean and standard deviation (
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> = 9.47 tons and 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> = 98.8 tons), the 99- and 99.9-percentile would be, respectively, 1.4 times and 1.8 times the 95-percentile.
