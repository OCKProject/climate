<p id="Par25" class="p">Even in a future with a warmer climate, there is no guarantee that any given day, or even a given year, will be warmer than in the present. Rather, global average temperatures will be higher, with potential changes in weather patterns, prevailing winds, ice cover, etc. As climate change is a statistical phenomenon, any single simulation of an oil spill at a given time and location is not particularly relevant for this study. Instead, we are interested in how the distribution of probable outcomes will change with the changing climate.</p>
