<p id="Par26" class="p">Ensemble simulation methods are commonly used in the study of chaotic systems, such as the weather and the ocean. In this paper, when referring to an ensemble, we mean a collection of oil spill simulations, where each simulation has used different environmental forcing data. The environmental data are available as two archives, one historical hindcast archive, covering 2009–2012 (and some months into 2013), and one climate forecast archive, covering 2050–2053 (and some months into 2054). The variation in environmental data is achieved through varying the start date of the simulation, and selecting the corresponding data (current, wind, ice cover and water temperature) from the two archives. In a real oil spill at a given location, the timing will determine the currents, winds, waves and other meteorological conditions, which together with the release parameters determine the transport and fate of the spill. Hence, by carrying out large ensembles of oil spill simulations with different start times, we sample from the distribution of possible predicted outcomes for that location.</p>
