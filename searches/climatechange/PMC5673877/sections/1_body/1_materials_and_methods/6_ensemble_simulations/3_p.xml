<p id="Par27" class="p">We have performed ensemble simulations for six different scenarios (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For each scenario, we started one simulated oil spill every 6 h for 2 × 4 years, in total 11 688 simulations per scenario. Each simulation was set up as an individual OSCAR scenario, and took approximately 6 min to run, for a total of about 7000 CPU hours. The simulations were carried out on a 32-core compute node, using the linux version of OSCAR.
