<p id="Par24" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the ice coverage (fraction of the sea surface covered by ice) is shown, for each of the six release locations. In the Finnmark scenario, there is fully open water both in the present and the future, while in the Svalbard scenario, there is quite high ice cover for several months of the year in the present, but always open water in the future. For the two Greenland scenarios, the change in ice cover can be clearly seen as a longer season of open water in the future scenarios. For the Kara scenario, there is clearly a winter season also in the future data, but it is shorter, and with less ice cover on average. For the Varandey scenario, the picture is less clear, with highly variable ice cover in both the present and the future, but on average there is somewhat less ice in the future. As a rule of thumb, a surface oil slick is considered to move as if in completely open water for ice coverage less than 30%, and as if in full ice cover if the ice coverage is above 70%. The current and wind data show less clear differences between present and future. Some information on the wind and current data can be found in the form of wind/current roses in Figs.
