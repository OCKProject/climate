<p id="Par15" class="p">The ice model in SINMOD is a Hibler formulation (Hibler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1979</xref>), and has two state variables: average ice thickness in a grid cell, 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>, and the fraction of a grid cell covered by ice, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. The remaining fraction, 1 − 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>, is open water. The equation solver uses the elastic–viscous–plastic mechanism as described by Hunke and Dukowicz (
