<p id="Par11" class="p">Current and wind data are required as input for oil spill trajectory modelling. The SINMOD hydrodynamic model was used to produce the current data (Slagstad and McClimans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2005</xref>). SINMOD is based on the primitive Navierâ€“Stokes equations and is established on a 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>-grid, using a constant-depth discretisation. The vertical turbulent mixing coefficient is calculated as a function of the Richardson number, 
 <italic class="italic">Ri</italic>, and the wave state. The flow becomes turbulent when 
 <italic class="italic">Ri</italic> is smaller than 0.65 (Price et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1986</xref>). Near the surface, vertical mixing due to wind waves is calculated from wind speed and fetch length. Horizontal mixing is calculated according to Smagorinsky (
