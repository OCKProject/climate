<p id="Par12" class="p">The SINMOD model area used to generate the hydrodynamic data for this study is shown in dashed outline in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The model area has a spatial resolution of 4 × 4 km, and the dataset produced has a temporal resolution of 2 h. Boundary conditions were taken from a larger model domain, at 20 × 20 km resolution. A total of 8 tidal components were imposed by specifying the various components at the open boundaries of the large-scale model. Tidal data were taken from TPXO 6.2 model of global ocean tides (Egbert et al.
