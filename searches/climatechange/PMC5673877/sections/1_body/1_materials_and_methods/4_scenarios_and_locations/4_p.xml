<p id="Par22" class="p">The next two scenarios (Svalbard and Kara Strait) are shipping accidents, where we consider a surface spill of 200 metric tons of marine diesel, over a period of 3 h. For the two shipping accident scenarios, we have selected to use a marine diesel, which has a density of 0.843 g/ml (API Gravity 36.4), with a low pour-point (lower than − 24°C). The diesel oil will not emulsify and form stable water-in-oil emulsions and minor water uptake is expected. Both the fresh oil and its evaporated residues exhibit low viscosities.</p>
