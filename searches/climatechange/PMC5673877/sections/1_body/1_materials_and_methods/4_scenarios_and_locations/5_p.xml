<p id="Par23" class="p">The final scenario (Varandey) is a pipeline leak, near the Varandey oil export terminal, located 22 km off the coast, in a shallow area to the west of the Kara Strait. Two hundred metric tons of oil are assumed to leak out over a period of 3 h, from a depth of 14 m (1 m above the sea bed). Here we have chosen a Russian Export crude oil for the modelling. It is a medium density oil, at 0.871 g/ml (API gravity 31). The oil exhibits features of an intermediate between an asphaltenic and a more paraffinic oil, due to the relatively high content of asphaltenes (1% by weight). The oil exhibits a low to medium evaporative loss, and the oil will easily emulsify and form stable water-in-oil emulsions with high viscosities and high water content (70–80% by volume). This oil is expected to be dispersible with application of chemical dispersants.</p>
