<p id="Par21" class="p">The next two scenarios (Greenland I and Greenland II) are also well blowouts, with all parameters except location and depth equal to the Finnmark scenario. The difference between the two Greenland scenarios is the location, i.e. the depth and distance from the coast. We have selected to use the properties of crude oil from the Statfjord C field for the modelling of the three well blowouts. The Statfjord C Blend crude oil is regarded as a paraffinic medium crude oil with a density of 0.834Â g/ml (API gravity 38). The fresh oil has a medium content of wax (4.1% by weight) and low asphaltenes (0.09% by weight) compared with other crude oils in the Norwegian sector. The oil exhibits a medium evaporative loss and forms relatively stable water-in-oil emulsions with high water content (approximately 80%).</p>
