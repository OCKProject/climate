<p id="Par19" class="p">Six scenarios were selected to be used as case studies. Details of the scenarios are provided in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. We would like to stress that these scenarios are fictitious, and were made up to show how the footprint of an oil spill might differ under a climate change scenario. These scenarios are not meant to represent the most likely oil spill scenarios in the Arctic, and do not take into account expected changes in activities and shipping routes between the present and the future.
