<p id="Par17" class="p">The OSCAR model computes surface spreading of oil, slick transport, entrainment into the water column, evaporation, emulsification and shore interactions to determine oil drift and fate at the surface. In the water column, horizontal and vertical transport by currents, dissolution, adsorption and settling are simulated. The different solubility, volatility and aquatic toxicity of oil components are accounted for by representing oil in terms of 25 pseudo-components (Reed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2000</xref>), which represent groups of chemicals with similar physical and chemical properties. By modelling the fate of individual pseudo-components, changes in oil composition due to evaporation, dissolution and biodegradation are accounted for. There is a biodegradation rate for each of the pseudo-components for the dissolved water fraction, droplet water fraction, surface and sediments (Brakstad and Faksness
