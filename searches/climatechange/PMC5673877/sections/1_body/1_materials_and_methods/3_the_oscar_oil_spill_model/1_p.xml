<p id="Par16" class="p">For the oil spill simulations in this paper, we have used OSCAR, which is a fully three-dimensional oil spill trajectory model for predicting the transport, fate and effects of released oil. The model accounts for weathering, the physical and chemical processes affecting oil at sea, as well as biodegradation. The development of models for these processes is strongly coupled with laboratory and field activities at SINTEF, on the transport, fate and effects of oil and oil components in the marine environment (Brandvik et al.
