<p id="Par18" class="p">OSCAR uses a Lagrangian particle transport model, where the release is represented by numerical particles (Reed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2000</xref>). Each numerical particle is transported individually through the flow field. Buoyancy and sinking of oil droplets due to density differences or oil mineral aggregates are also included. Required inputs to the OSCAR model are currents, wind and ice (if relevant). The chemical composition of the released oil is also an essential part of the input to OSCAR.
