<p id="Par46" class="p">In general, there is a change in the fate of a “typical” oil spill from the present to the warmer future considered here. The change seems to mainly come from the fact that there is a longer open water season in the future. Furthermore, the nature of the change depends on the scenario considered. For the two Greenland cases, we see from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> that there is a larger (in terms of area) surface slick, more oil on the shore and larger variations in the future. In the Svalbard scenario, on the other hand, there is a substantial decrease in expected amount of stranded oil and area of the surface slick, while for the Kara scenario, there is little change in either endpoint. While the specific geographic distribution of oil has not been considered in this study, it seems reasonable to assume that the exact effect of a change in, e.g. ice cover, will be highly dependent on local conditions. For example, for a near-shore release, the ice can act to either shield the coast or trap the oil along the coast, depending on the spatial distribution of ice.
