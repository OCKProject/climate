<p id="Par48" class="p">The probability of oil spill accidents in the Arctic is expected to increase in concert with increases in transport and resource exploration and extraction activities. The results reported here suggest that future oil spills in a warming climate will in some cases result in greater areal coverage and increased shoreline exposure, due to reduced ice coverage. These two considerations point towards an increase in environmental risk, defined as the probability of an event, in this case an oil spill, weighted by the magnitude of the resulting environmental injury. Furthermore, the study highlights the need to take ice into account in Environmental Risk Assessments for petroleum operations in the Arctic, as well as the need for further development of ice modelling, as well as oil-in-ice trajectory modelling. Finally, longer time series of environmental data, ideally 10Â years or more, should be used for Environmental Risk Assessments in the Arctic. </p>
