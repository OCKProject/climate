<p id="Par47" class="p">We have demonstrated that ice cover is extremely important for the prediction of the probable fate of an Arctic oil spill. Not only does the presence of ice affect the average mass balance of an oil spill, but it also modifies the probability distributions associated with the different environmental compartments. When carrying out an Environmental Risk Assessment, it is essential to have an idea of the probability distributions involved, in order to design the ensemble of simulations in a way that will give statistically robust results. The integration of ice cover into oil spill trajectory models is still a developing field, and this study demonstrates the importance of continued research, given the significant impact ice cover has on the results of the oil spill simulations. The further development of high-resolution coupled ice-ocean models is also essential, as for example the amount of stranded oil is expected to be very sensitive to the local distribution of sea ice.</p>
