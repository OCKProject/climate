<p id="Par41" class="p">For the amount of biodegraded oil, and to some degree the amount of oil on the surface, there is a clear difference between summer and winter, but little change from present to future. This indicates that the main reason for any differences between present and future is the longer ice-free season in the future. For the amount of stranded oil, the picture is less clear. This is however not entirely unexpected, since the amount of stranded oil seems to follow a more fat-tailed distribution (Nordam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2016</xref>), and accurately estimating the parameters of a fat-tailed distribution requires considerably more data than estimating the parameters of a more “normal” (Gaussian-like) distribution. Considering the Varandey and Svalbard scenarios, and to some degree the Kara scenario, there is a clear increase in, e.g. the 95-percentile of amount of stranded oil in the winter season. For the two Greenland scenarios, however, the 95-percentile is essentially unchanged from summer to winter in the present case, and decreasing from summer to winter in the future.
