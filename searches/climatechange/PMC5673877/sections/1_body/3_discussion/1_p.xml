<p id="Par40" class="p">From the results of the ensemble simulations, we find, not unexpectedly, that the presence of high ice cover will significantly alter the dynamics of an oil spill. Interestingly, however, the presence of ice does not only change the average values of oil in each environmental compartment. Instead, the probability distributions for amount of oil in the different compartments are modified, as can be seen from the empirical distributions shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. This is especially clear for the amount of oil on the surface, which in turn is very relevant for amount of stranded oil, and potential for contact with birds or mammals.
