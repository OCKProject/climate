<p id="Par43" class="p">Perhaps more surprising is that amount of biodegraded oil is positively correlated with ice cover in some cases, and negatively in others. We also note that except in the Varandey case, ice cover does not show a particularly strong correlation to amount of oil in the sediment, which is somewhat surprising, given that open water and waves are required to submerge the oil and bring it into contact with the sea floor. A more detailed study of the spatial distribution of ice in each individual simulation would be required to adequately explain these results.</p>
