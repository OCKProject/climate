<p id="Par44" class="p">We note that even if ice cover does not always have the strongest correlations with the environmental endpoints, it still seems to work very well as a criterion for separating simulations into winter and summer dynamics. For example, for the amount of oil on the surface in the Varandey scenario, ice cover does not stand out among the correlations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, yet the split on ice cover produces an empirical distribution for the summer that is quite similar between present and future, and quite distinct from the winter distributions, which are again very similar between present and future (see Fig.
