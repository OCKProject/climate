<p id="Par42" class="p">From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, we see that in many cases ice cover shows the strongest correlation with the different environmental endpoints. For example, in each case where there is ice, there is a strong, negative correlation between amount of evaporated oil and ice cover, meaning that a higher ice cover on average means less evaporation, which is to be expected. As is also to be expected, there is a strong negative correlation between ice cover and amount of submerged oil, and a strong positive correlation between ice and amount of oil at the surface (except in the Varandey case, where both correlations are less strong), the reason being that the ice prevents waves from submerging the oil. Recall that oil trapped at the ice–water interface is considered to be at the surface.
