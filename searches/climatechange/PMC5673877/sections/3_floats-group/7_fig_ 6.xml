  <p class="p">Normalised cross-correlation of amount in the six environmental compartments, with five environmental inputs: wind speed, wind direction, current speed, current direction and ice cover. Present (2009–2012) shown in blue, future (2050–2053) shown in red. All environmental inputs are averaged over the 15-day simulation period, and cross-correlations are calculated by matching the time series of simulation results with the averaged input from each simulation</p>
