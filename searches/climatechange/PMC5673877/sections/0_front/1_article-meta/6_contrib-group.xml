    <p id="Par4" class="p">recently retired as a Senior Researcher at SINTEF Ocean after more than 30Â years in oil spill modelling. He is one of the original developers of the SINTEF Oil Spill Contingency and Response (OSCAR), Dose-related Risk and Effects Assessment Model (DREAM) and Oil Weathering Model (OWM). He is also known as one of the developers of the Environmental Impact Factor (EIF) to assess risk and the U.S. CERCLA Superfund Type A Natural Resource Damage Assessment Models. Notable achievements including modelling for the U.N. for the damage assessment for the 1991 Gulf War oil spill.</p>
