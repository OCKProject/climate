  <p class="p">Dominant contributors to the variations of dust event frequency. Regression coefficients are obtained by regressing the dust event frequency in each season onto the standardized precipitation (purple), bareness (orange), and surface wind speed (green) from 2004 to 2015. The color of the shading denotes the largest coefficient in absolute value among the three while the saturation of the color shows the magnitude of the coefficient (from 0 to 2). Regression coefficients significant at the 90% confidence level (Bootstrap test) are dotted. Missing values are shaded in grey. Maps were generated using the NCAR Command Language (NCL;
