<p id="Par13" class="p">CMIP5 models simulate changes of the climate system in response to different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We select models for which precipitation, bareness (or LAI), and surface wind speed interactively respond to climate changes (i.e., radiation, temperature, soil moisture, etc.). Using the regression model and projected changes of precipitation, bareness, and surface wind speed from 16 CMIP5 models (Supplementary Table
