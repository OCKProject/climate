<p id="Par18" class="p">CMIP5 models project an overall dustier future than that projected from the regression analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). DOD increases in most of the U.S. in spring, with a center over the southern Great Plains (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). The dustier region extends further north in summer, although some models project a decrease of DOD over the northern Great Plains and the northwest coast, while in fall the increase of DOD is largely over the southern U.S. with a weak decrease in the north.
