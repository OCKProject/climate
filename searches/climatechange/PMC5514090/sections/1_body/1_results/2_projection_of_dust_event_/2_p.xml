<p id="Par14" class="p">The dust event frequency reduces in the northern Great Plains and eastern U.S. in all seasons, with the largest reduction in spring, largely produced by the increase of precipitation and decrease of bareness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Dust event frequency also decreases in the western U.S. in winter and spring, but increases in the southwestern U.S in summer and fall. An increase of frequency up to 5% (about five more dusty days) is located in southern Texas in spring and extends to the central Plains in summer and persists to fall. Such an increase is largely associated with precipitation reduction and an increase of bareness due to vegetation decay, while an increase of surface wind in spring and summer also plays an important role (Fig.
