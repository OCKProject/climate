<p id="Par15" class="p">The differences among CMIP5 models in changes in precipitation, bareness, and surface wind in the late twenty-first century lead to the spread of dust event frequency variations projected by the regression model. While most models agree with the increase of precipitation in the northern Great Plains from winter to spring and thus a reduction of dust event frequency, the variations of dust event frequency associated with summer precipitation change in the southern Great Plains have less consistency among the models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Models also have large disagreement on the direction of how bareness (or LAI) will change, especially over the southern Great Plains, and such a disagreement extends to the northern Great Plains in summer and fall. On the other hand, the increase of dust event frequency produced by an increase of surface wind over the southern Great Plains in spring and summer are consistently projected by the models, in association with a projected intensification of the Great Plains low-level jet

 </sup>. Despite the large spread of the regression, there is broad agreement in the increase of dust event frequency in the southern Great Plains in summer and a decrease in the northern Great Plains in spring.
