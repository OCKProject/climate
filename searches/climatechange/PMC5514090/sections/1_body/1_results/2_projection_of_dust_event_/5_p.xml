<p id="Par17" class="p">What is the projection of the CMIP5 models on the variation of dust activity? Most models do not save DOD as an output, so we used monthly dust load and converted it to DOD (see Methods). Among the 16 models, only seven models used an interactive dust scheme and have output of dust load (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Among these models, three simulated the magnitude of DOD in the U.S. that is comparable to the Aqua DOD from spring to fall (differences are within one order of magnitude), while other models underestimate DOD in all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>). The spatial pattern of DOD is also not well captured by the models. Summer is the season when the ensemble mean shows better agreement with observations in terms of both magnitude and spatial pattern.
