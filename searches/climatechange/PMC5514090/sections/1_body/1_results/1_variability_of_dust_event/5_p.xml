 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows which one of the three factors contributes the most to dust event frequency over the United States for each season. Over the Great Plains, the dominant factors affecting dust event frequency in winter are precipitation and surface wind speed. In spring, surface wind becomes more important, along with bareness. The former is related to the development of the Great Plains low-level jet (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>) in April and May, and the latter is associated with the start of the growing season in the Great Plains (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Spring precipitation is also important over the southern Great Plains. In summer, precipitation and bareness are two dominant factors influencing the dust event frequency in the Great Plains, while in fall bareness is the most influential factor.
