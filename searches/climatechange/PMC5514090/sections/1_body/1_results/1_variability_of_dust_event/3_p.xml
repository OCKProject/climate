<p id="Par5" class="p">In addition to precipitation, surface wind and surface bareness can also contribute to the variability of dust emission and transport (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>). To examine the connections between dust event frequency and these potentially influential factors, a multiple-linear regression is applied to the seasonal averaged precipitation, surface wind speed, and bareness to examine their contribution to seasonal dust event frequency.
