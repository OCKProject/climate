<p id="Par9" class="p">How well the regression analysis resembles the physical connection between dust activity and the three influential factors is examined for recent severe drought years in the southern Great Plains (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). During the 2011 drought, the decrease of precipitation is accompanied by an increase of DOD from spring to fall. The increase of bareness generally follows the precipitation deficit and is consistent with the increase of DOD. Surface wind also increases in spring, summer and late fall, facilitating the emission and transport of dust particles. Precipitation deficiency over the southern Great Plains is weaker in 2012, and so are the variations of DOD and bareness, while the contribution from the surface wind is mainly in early summer and late fall.
