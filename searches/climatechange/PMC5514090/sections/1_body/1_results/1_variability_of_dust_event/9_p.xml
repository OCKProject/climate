<p id="Par11" class="p">It is possible that the strength of the relationships among dust, precipitation, surface wind, and bareness established in the recent decade will vary over a longer time period. For instance, during very dry episodes, the occurrence of dust events may be more sensitive to wind speed but less so to lower-than-normal precipitation as the surface is already quite dry. However, an overall negative connection between dust event frequency and seasonal mean precipitation and positive connections with surface wind speed and bareness should still largely hold.</p>
