<p id="Par8" class="p">Only a narrow band over the southwest shows a relatively strong linear relationship between dust event frequency and the three factors. Bareness plays the most important role over central California in winter and over southern California from spring to fall. Other factors such as surface wind and precipitation seem to have weaker connections with dust event frequency. One explanation is that precipitation is relatively low during the dusty seasons in spring and summer (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), and thus vegetation growth becomes the most influential factor limiting dust events. On the other hand, variations of bareness also reflect the influence of precipitation in previous seasons. For instance, summer bareness is significantly negatively correlated with spring precipitation in this region. Some missing values also may limit our regression analysis in this region, such as in northeast California due to the missing data of LAI.
