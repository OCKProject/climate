 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the climatology (2003–2015) of the frequency of dust events over the contiguous U.S., derived from daily dust optical depth (DOD; see Methods) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, in each season. The high frequency over California, Arizona and northern Mexico largely matches the dust sources (such as the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts) in these regions. The hot spot over the Great Plains in spring and summer is associated with wind erosion in farmland and a few dry lakes, whereas in the southern Great Plains and the Gulf coast transported dust from Africa and northern Mexico can also contribute to the high frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that although the frequency over the eastern coast in spring is comparable to that over the Great Plains, the magnitude of those events is much lower, as the background DOD is lower in the eastern U.S. (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Over the southwestern U.S. (Box 1 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and the northern Great Plains (Box 4), strong dust events usually occur in spring, while in the southern Great Plains (Box 3), summer is the dustiest season (Fig.
