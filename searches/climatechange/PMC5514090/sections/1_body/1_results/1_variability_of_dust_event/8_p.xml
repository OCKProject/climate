<p id="Par10" class="p">The regression model can largely capture the interannual variation of dust event frequency during 2004–2015 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). The correlation between the calculated dust event frequency and that of Aqua ranges from 0.70 in fall to 0.91 in summer in the western U.S., and from 0.84 in winter to 0.94 in summer in the Great Plains, indicating that the three controlling factors (precipitation, bareness, and surface wind speed) can statistically explain 49–83% of the variances of dust event frequency in the western U.S. and 71–88% in the Great Plains during the recent decade.
