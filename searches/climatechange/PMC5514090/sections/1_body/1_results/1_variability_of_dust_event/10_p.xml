<p id="Par12" class="p">Another important factor associated with dust emission but not considered here is the change of land use/land cover. For instance, the devastating Dust Bowl in the 1930s was caused by a combination of persistent drought, land use/land cover change, i.e., grasslands to non-irrigated croplands decades before the Dust Bowl and losses of vegetation cover during the Dust Bowl, improper farming methods (such as “dust mulch”) that increased the erodibility of top soil, and economic factors

 </sup>. LAI used in the regression model shows the overall vegetation density but provides no specific information regarding to the type of land cover or the use of land. The short time period examined here also prohibits any further analysis on the change of land use/land cover on dust emission, which could take a much longer time (e.g., several decades). Therefore, the following analysis focuses on changes of dust activity associated with climate change and variability.
