<p id="Par4" class="p">Will drought intensify dust activities in the U.S.? We first examine how precipitation variations influence dust activities. Precipitation can reduce dust activities by scavenging airborne dust and increasing soil moisture in the dust source region (e.g., ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>), prohibiting the uplifting of dust particles by winds, and therefore precipitation deficits usually favor dust activity (e.g., refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the dust event frequency from 2003 (2004 winter) to 2015 along with precipitation anomalies (with reference to the climatology) in each season. In the recent decade, several severe droughts have been reported, such as the 2011 drought in the southern Great Plains, 2012 drought centered in the central Great Plains, and the California droughts from late 2011 to 2015 (also extending to 2016) and a slightly weaker dry period from 2007 to 2009 (e.g., refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>). The maxima of dust event frequency match these dry episodes quite well (grey shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We also found there are positive linear trends of dust event frequency in the northern Great Plains in winter (p &lt; 0.002) and spring (p = 0.09), and over the southwestern U.S. in spring (p = 0.07), which is to some extent consistent with the recent positive trends of dust emissions found in the western and southwestern U.S.

 </sup>, although different time periods were examined in these studies. Due to the short time coverage of the data, it is hard to determine whether the positive trends are associated with any long-term trend or just a part of decadal variations.
