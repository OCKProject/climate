<p id="Par26" class="p">Precipitation, LAI, and surface wind speed from 16 CMIP5 models (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) are used as input for the regression model to calculate the variations of dust event frequency. Monthly output from both the historical run (1861–2005) and the RCP 8.5 run (2051–2100) are used to generate seasonal means. Seven out of the 16 models calculated dust concentration interactively (i.e., not prescribed) in the model and are used to derive DOD shown in Fig.
