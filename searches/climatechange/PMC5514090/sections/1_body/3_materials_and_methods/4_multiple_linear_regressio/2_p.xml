<p id="Par30" class="p">Besides comparing the calculated dust event frequency with observations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>, we also examined the capability of the model by comparing the calculated dust event frequency from 1995–2014 with the coarse mode aerosol optical depth (COD) at 500 nm from an AERONET site at Sevilleta, New Mexico (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). The COD is processed by the Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm

 </sup>. Sevilleta site (34.4°N, 106.9°W) is the only available site with more than 10 years of records with proximity to major dust sources in the U.S. The variations of dust event frequency from some nearby grids show significant positive correlations with the COD data from spring to fall (Supplementary Fig.
