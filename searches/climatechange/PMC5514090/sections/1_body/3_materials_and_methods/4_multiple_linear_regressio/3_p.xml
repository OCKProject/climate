<p id="Par31" class="p">The projection of dust event frequency change used the regression coefficients derived from 2004–2015 and CMIP5 model output of precipitation, LAI, and surface wind speed. All model output are interpolated to a 2° by 2.5° grid. The differences between the historical run (1861–2005 average) and that of the RCP 8.5 run for the late half of the twenty-first century (2051–2100) are standardized by the standard deviation of the historical run for each explanatory variable. The projected change reveals how the frequency of dust event will vary with reference to the historical conditions (mean and standard deviation).</p>
