<p id="Par29" class="p">The multiple-linear regression coefficients are calculated by regressing the dust event frequency onto standardized seasonal mean precipitation from PRECL, bareness derived from AVHRR LAI, and NARR surface wind speed from 2004 to 2015 for each season. All the data are interpolated to a 1° by 1° grid before the calculation. Over regions where values were missing for any of the explanatory variables (i.e., precipitation, bareness, and surface wind speed) or dust event frequency, the regression coefficients are set to missing values. The missing value in the southwestern U.S. is mainly related to missing data from LAI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Since these controlling factors are not completely independent of each other, i.e., precipitation can influence vegetation growth by affecting soil moisture and radiation and thus bareness, and surface wind can interact with precipitation, the collinearity among these factors are examined by calculating variable inflation factor (VIF) (e.g., ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>), and in most regions the VIF is below 3 (not shown), suggesting a low collinearity (5–10 is usually considered high).
