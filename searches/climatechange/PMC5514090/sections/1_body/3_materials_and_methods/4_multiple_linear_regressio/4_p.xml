<p id="Par32" class="p">The agreement between the models is calculated by comparing the sign of the variable (e.g., the changes of dust event frequency) in an individual model with that of the multi-model ensemble mean. An agreement of 100% denotes that the direction of change (i.e., RCP8.5 run minus the historical run) projected by all individual models are the same as the ensemble mean, and a 62.5% agreement denotes 10 models show the change with the same sign as the multi-model mean.</p>
