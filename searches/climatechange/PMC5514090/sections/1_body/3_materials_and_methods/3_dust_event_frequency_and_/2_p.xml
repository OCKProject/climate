<p id="Par28" class="p">Since the dust emission and transport is coupled with both land surface features such as bareness and also meteorological conditions such as surface winds and precipitation, its seasonal cycle varies over regions. To understand the dust activities we selected three regions, e.g., the southwestern U.S. (WST1; Box1 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the southern Great Plains (SGP; Box 3) and the northern Great Plains (NGP; Box 4) to calculate dust event frequency in each region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and regional averaged frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). These regions have quite different seasonality of the distribution of dust event frequency (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) and seasonal cycle of DOD (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The calculation of multiple-linear regression introduced more missing values in the southwestern U.S., so a larger domain, the western U.S. (WST; Boxes 1 and 2), is used later when examining the results from the regression analysis.
