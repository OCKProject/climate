<p id="Par19" class="p">This is an early attempt to project future changes in dust activity in the U.S. caused by increasing greenhouse gases, and the projections are based on the understanding of the controlling factors affecting dust event frequency in the present-day climate. Changes in land use associated with anthropogenic activities are not included in our regression model although some information is implicitly included in the simulation of vegetation coverage by some CMIP5 models (about 14 models, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) for future projections. While studies found changes of land use played an important role in the dust emission in the western U.S. in the past 200 years

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. However, whether dramatic land use change such as that before and during the Dust Bowl will occur over the Great Plains is hard to predict, depending on climate variability, irrigation technology and farming method, and economic conditions

 </sup>. The non-linear interactions among precipitation, bareness, and surface wind variations are also not included. The uncertainties associated with CMIP5 projections of the three controlling factors also limit the accuracy of our projections, especially when the factor is identified as the dominant contributor to the variations of dust event frequency, e.g., LAI and precipitation in the Great Plains (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig.
