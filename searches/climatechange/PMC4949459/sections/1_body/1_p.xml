<p class="p">Examination of temperature anomalies during maize growing season is of great importance as it strongly connects to yield. Temperatures lower than 10 °C greatly retard photosynthesis and development
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>; nevertheless, such low temperatures during the growing season months are not common in most maize-growing areas. Increased maximum temperatures during late vegetative (e.g., tasseling) and early reproductive growth stages (e.g., grain filling) shorten the ripening period, stress the crop, and reduce final yield
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. Additionally, elevated temperatures increase evapotranspiration rates (evaporation and plant transpiration) which can result in water deficit. The associated yield impact is more apparent in drought events (non-irrigated agriculture) during the one month period before and after the first reproductive growth stage
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. A few studies have demonstrated the importance of maximum temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> and growth stage-specific precipitation amount
