<p class="p">Average global temperatures have increased by 0.4 °C during the last three decades and in some regions even greater increases have been observed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The influence of in-season weather trends on crops yields such as soybean, wheat, and maize has been explored in several countries

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Quantified impacts of climate change in a US-wide study showed a 17% potential yield decrease in maize yield for each degree increase in growing season temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. However, weather-related variability in agricultural production is region-specific and can reach up to 80%
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. In addition, crop responses to weather fluctuations vary among vegetative and reproductive stages
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref> and the period of time used to quantify climate trends has been identified as an important factor when evaluating the effects of climate on agriculture
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Therefore, the region-specific evaluation of climate change effects on agricultural production based on early-(planting to early vegetative crop growth stages), mid-(late vegetative stages to early reproductive growth stages) and late-growing season (late reproductive growth stages to harvest) climate trends is imperative
