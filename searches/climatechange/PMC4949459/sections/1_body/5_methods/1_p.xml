<p class="p">To examine the effect of climate change on maize yield and monthly weather conditions, a database including historical records of non-irrigated maize yield and monthly weather data (precipitation, average, maximum, and minimum temperature) from five locations in the southeastern U.S. was assembled (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Material Table S2</xref> – numbers 1–5). The three locations in Alabama included data from 1971–2013, whereas Georgia locations included data from 1981–2013. To evaluate the effect of climate change on maize yield the March-September month-specific cumulative precipitation and average, maximum and minimum air temperatures were used in the analysis as predictor variables. Additionally, two indices were evaluated as explanatory variables, the Shannon diversity index- SDI
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>, and the abundant and well-distributed rainfall-AWDR index
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. The SDI values ranges between 0–1 and values closer to 1 imply more evenly distributed rainfall in a given period, whereas larger AWDR values (no boundaries for its possible values) represent abundant and well-distributed water availability.
