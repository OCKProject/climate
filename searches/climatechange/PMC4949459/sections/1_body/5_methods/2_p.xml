<p class="p">Because it is difficult to isolate and remove all possible non-weather factors that might affect crop yield, prior the analysis we calculated first-year differences (year-to-year changes)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> for the maize yields and explanatory variables to minimize the impact of other long-term factors. However, it was not possible to include all variables to a single multiple regression analysis due to severe multicollinearity issues. To identify the most appropriate set of variables, first-year differences (year-to-year changes) of the monthly average, minimum, maximum temperatures, monthly SDI and AWDR values, and monthly cumulative precipitation were regressed against first-year yield differences. The most appropriate model was the one using monthly maximum temperatures and monthly precipitation combined as explanatory variables. It was considered superior according to several statistical criteria, such as the smaller mean squared error (MSE), the larger coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and adjusted R
