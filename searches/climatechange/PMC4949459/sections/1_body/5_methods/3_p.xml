<p class="p">To examine the influence of ENSO on month-specific climate conditions and maize yield, all the available years (1971–2013) were separated into three ENSO categories as characterized by the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) index (

It has been reported that during weak ENSO events, there is no clear Pacific/North American oscillation pattern which prevents influential energy propagation towards the North Atlantic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>; therefore, in the analysis we considered only years with strong ENSO. As a classification rule we characterized years with December-March MEI ranks &lt; 8 as La Niña. Years with December-March MEI ranks &gt; 58 were characterized as El Niño. MEI rank values between 20 and 46 for the same 4 months would denote a year with Neutral phase. Years that the ENSO condition shifted significantly among short periods were not included in any ENSO phase and were characterized as undefined. From the 43 years, 7 years belonged to El Niño, 9 to La Niña, and 16 to the Neutral phase of ENSO (

To further examine the influence of ENSO on parameters that influence maize yield, an additional database including monthly soil moisture content data from 2003–2013 from Blairsville, Tifton, and Calhoun (
