<p class="p">Variation in year-to-year spring and summer climate conditions can be attributed to ENSO condition and to climate change. A few studies have focused on month-specific weather anomalies (mediated by climate change) effects on crop yield

However, the effect of a strong ENSO phase on month-specific climate patterns and its associated effect on a cropsâ€™ yield in not well examined. Season-wide effects averaged across large areas is useful information; however, warming trends are not spatially and temporally uniform
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Therefore, fine temporal resolution and location-specific quantification of both, climate change and ENSO effects, on climate patterns and crop yield is important for growers and agricultural-related industries since potential yield impacts can result in significant monetary loss and put food security at risk
