<p class="p">Location-specific climate-yield statistical models based on monthly maximum temperature and monthly cumulative precipitation accounted for 74–91% in maize yield variability. From all the locations, the Blairsville-specific model resulted in non-significant regression (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In the case of maximum temperature, effects in June were the greatest. According to our estimates, a 1 °C increase in March maximum temperature increased yield in Tifton by 268 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and suppressed yield in Fairhope by 760 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The same increase in April temperature increased yield in Belle Mina by 600 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> whereas 1 °C increase in June decreased Belle Mina and Prattville yields by 1262 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and by 735 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> respectively. A 1090 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> reduction in Belle Mina and a 524 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yield reduction in Tifton was associated with 1 °C increase in September and in July, respectively; however, the same increase in September maximum temperature favored yield in Prattville by 609 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. When aggregated in southeastern U.S. average, the negative effects of maximum June and July temperatures were significant and resulted in 15% maize yield suppression. The weather conditions during these two months, and especially of June, have been identified as key in estimating impacts on maize yield

Nevertheless, across the examined region, the 1981–2013 maximum temperature anomalies during June and July were suppressing yields more than the rest growing season months. The greater impact of these two summer months on maize yield compare to the rest was attributed to the sensitivity of maize to weather conditions the one month period before and after the first reproductive growth stage
