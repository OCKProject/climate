<p class="p">The sensitivity of the results to the analysis used (least squared method) was evaluated by repeating the analysis using the maximum and restricted maximum likelihood methods. The direction and magnitude of the effects did not change and therefore we report the least squared method results. Also, since no extreme weather yield impacts are included in this study, we consider the documented effects on maize yield as a lower bound given that climate change is likely to increase the frequency of extreme weather events
