<p class="p">We show that climate anomalies are month-specific and can have significant negative effect on maize yield and on the annual yield gain. Under average climatic conditions, yields and annual yield trend across the southeastern U.S. might have been greater than those observed during the 43 years of the study. However, apart from the negative effects of climate change, the southeastern U.S. climate is strongly influenced by ENSO condition. Maximum temperatures in June during La Niña years were 0.7 °C higher than El Niño years and cumulative precipitation was 10 mm lower. However, maximum temperatures in July during La Niña years were 0.4 °C lower than El Niño years and cumulative precipitation was 17 mm higher. These results show that month-specific weather patterns vary between Niña and Niño years. According to our estimates of maximum temperature effects on maize yield, a significant suppression might be associated due to elevated maximum June temperatures during La Niña years and due to increased maximum July temperatures during El Niño years.</p>
