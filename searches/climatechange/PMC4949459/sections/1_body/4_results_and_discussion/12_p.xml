<p class="p">Adaptation strategies can mitigate climate-induced negative effects on crop yields
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. The strong connection between southeastern U.S. climate and ENSO phases has resulted in seasonal climate forecast with lead times up to several months prior to the spring planting season in the region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. For a given ENSO phase, a grower can use the seasonal climate forecast to select the management practices that reduce the risk of adverse climatic conditions or the ones that will capitalize on the favorable climate conditions. These management practices can include adjusting planting dates to avoid the higher than normally expected temperatures during reproductive growth stages of the crop, or to take advantage of the expected increased spring precipitation as a result of an El Ni√±o phase. Our results suggest that future year-to-year maize yield variability might be greater than previously estimated in southeastern U.S.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref> due to the combined effect of elevated June-July maximum temperatures which are mediated by both, climate change and ENSO condition. Therefore, we highlight the importance of developing region-specific adaptation strategies based on quantification of both, climate change and ENSO effects on month-specific climate patterns and crop yields in sensitive, to the phenomenon, regions.
