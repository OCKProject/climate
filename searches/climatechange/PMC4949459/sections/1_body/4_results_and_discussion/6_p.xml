<p class="p">Variable month-specific climatic conditions were observed among ENSO phases from 1971–2013 (

Average, minimum, and maximum temperatures were greater during strong La Niña phase in March, April and June by 1.1, 1, and 0.7 °C, respectively, when compared to Neutral and El Niño phases. However, this pattern was reversed in July when 0.4 °C higher temperatures were observed during El Niño years. Large differences in precipitation among ENSO phases were detected in April, June, July, August, and September. Precipitation during El Niño was greater in April by 22 mm, in June by 10 mm and in August by 9.5 mm compared to La Niña phase. However, in strong La Niña years, a greater precipitation amount was observed in July (+17.4 mm) and in September (+32 mm) compared to El Niño years. These differences suggest that the monthly in-season climate patterns in southeastern U.S. vary greatly due to the influence of a strong ENSO condition from December-March.
