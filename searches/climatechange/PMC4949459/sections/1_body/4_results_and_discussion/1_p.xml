<p class="p">We show that over the past 33 years (1981â€“2013), monthly maximum temperature and precipitation trends varied among locations (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Most maximum temperature trends were positive across months and locations and were all positive when averaged across all regions. Nevertheless, differences in magnitude existed among locations. For example at Belle Mina, which located in north Alabama, the maximum temperature trend in June was the highest observed and monthly trends over the period June-September were higher than in all other locations. The precipitation trends were more variable than maximum temperature trends among locations and examined periods. During spring months, precipitation trends were negative whereas most July-September trends were positive. In June, trends varied among the five locations. However, the southeastern U.S. monthly average trends were negative in five out of the seven months of the maize growing season. Flowering and silking are the growth stages with the greatest water demand and occur in June across the examined region. Therefore, the importance of examining the month-specific weather effects on maize yield is further highlighted.
