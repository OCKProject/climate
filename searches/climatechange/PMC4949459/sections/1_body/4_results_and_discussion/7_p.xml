<p class="p">The final crop yield is strongly affected by changes in soil moisture content. This relation is strong in southeastern U.S. where most of agricultural land is non-irrigated and soils across the Coastal Plain have low water holding capacity. From 2003 until 2013, that data was available at 3 locations in GA, month-dependent greater soil moisture content was measured during El Niño years when compared to La Niña years by 1–4.2% (

Apart from March, in every month with a strong El Niño phase the precipitation was greater than the same months with a strong La Niña phase. It is interesting that in four out of the seven growing season months, the month-specific cumulative precipitation during neutral years was also greater than La Niña years precipitation which was considered as the main reason for greater soil moisture content in neutral years compared to La Niña years. The influence of the observed differences in temperatures, precipitation, and soil moisture were reflected in final yield (
