<p class="p">These results reveal the potential significant effects on the in-season weather variability mediated by climate change. Over the 33 years of the study, the potential yield effect of a 1 unit change in both, in-season monthly maximum temperature and cumulative precipitation, was negative and ranged from −25.1 to −1.6% losses depending on the location. When data were aggregated across locations, the climate change contribution resulted in 15.2% maize yield suppression. The most significant contribution was due to a 1 °C increase in June and July maximum temperatures that accounted for ~50% of the yield suppression respectively. These results demonstrate the greater impact of maximum temperature anomalies on maize yield compared to precipitation trends. This result is in agreement with previous reported climate change effects on soybean yield

It appears that increased maximum temperatures, during late vegetative and reproductive crop growth stages, stress the plant which is reflected in significant yield losses. This result is in further agreement with previous studies examining the maize growth stage-specific effect of maximum temperature and precipitation on final yield

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Material Table S2</xref>), the microclimate differences can be significant, especially when moving from the gulf shore (South-Fairhope) to the state boarders with Tennessee (North-Belle Mina). Additionally, soil type differences play an important role in the effect of precipitation on maize yield. For example, silt and clay soil particles (e.g., Belle Mina, Blairsville) exhibit improved water holding capacity, and therefore increased plant available water potential than sand particles (e.g., Prattville, Tifton, Fairhope). Therefore, the beneficial effects of increased precipitation would be more apparent in non-irrigated maize grown at locations with sandy soils. Additionally, moisture abundance in southeastern U.S. might have diminished the magnitude of the observed precipitation effects on maize yield. However, it should be noted that the effects of extreme flooding events have not been examined and therefore, the associated impacts might be greater than the effects we report.
