<p class="p">As discussed earlier, in southeastern U.S., June weather conditions are of great importance for maize production since late vegetative and early reproductive growth stages occur. The greater precipitation, soil moisture, and lower maximum temperatures during El Niño years compared to La Niña could justify the overall yield differences among ENSO phases. This result further underlines the importance of identifying the ENSO- and month-specific meteorological factors that result in such great yield variability rather than focusing only on ENSO effects or solely on climate change effects on maize yield.</p>
