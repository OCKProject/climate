<p class="p">In the case of monthly cumulative precipitation, a 10 mm precipitation increase in March favored maize yield in Tifton by 80 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The precipitation increase in April however, suppressed yield in Fairhope by 137 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The same increase in May precipitation favored yields in Prattville and in Tifton by 141 and 187 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. Similar responses were associated with precipitation increase in June at both locations. An increase in July precipitation increased maize yield in Prattville and decreased yield in Tifton. A 109 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yield suppression in Fairhope was associated with increased August precipitation. When yield impacts were averaged across the southeastern locations, increase in cumulative precipitation anomalies in April reduced maize yield, whereas increase in June precipitation contributed to higher yields. The beneficial effect of reduced precipitation in the planting period (March-April) and that of increased precipitation during kernel filling periods (starting in June) has also been documented in a study in central U.S.
