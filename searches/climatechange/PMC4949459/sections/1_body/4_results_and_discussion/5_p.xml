 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> due to March-September maximum temperature and precipitation anomalies, respectively. When data was aggregated and averaged across the southeastern U.S., the annual yield gain since 1981 was suppressed by ~25% (17.1 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), which was mainly influenced by year-to-year June maximum temperature anomalies. Due to the commonly used planting dates in the region, the late vegetative and early reproductive growth stages (when the crop is most susceptible to heat and drought stress) occur in June. These results are in agreement with previous studies
