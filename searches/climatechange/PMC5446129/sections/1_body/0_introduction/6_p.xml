<p class="p">This study aims to detect possible genetic consequences that could be referred to direct anthropogenic impact, especially a clearing of the channel in 1996. We monitored the largest CdV dragonfly population, the 
 <italic class="italic">Orthetrum coerulescens</italic> population, as an indicator species for this vulnerable freshwater habitat. Hereby the focus is on the influence of the dredging and the populationâ€™s potential to recover from its effect. A panel of microsatellite loci developed by Hadrys

With this first long(er) term study of population genetic metrics of a sensitive freshwater insect species it might be possible to distinguish between a populations snapshot and reliable dynamics related to environmental changes and/or anthropogenic impact.
