 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Only long-term data sets can reliably distinguish between sampling error and reasonable changes in abundance, population genetic metrics or influence of environmental variability [

 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Even more important, changes in genetic variation—the raw material of evolution—affect a population’s viability over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Consequently monitoring genetic diversity over a certain time period offers the chance to foresee trends and detect populations in need of conservation measures [
