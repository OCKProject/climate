<p class="p">The CO1 subset was envisaged to confirm the ND1 results, since former studies in odonates show mirrored results for both markers. However, in our data subset a significant higher genetic variation in terms of nucleotide substitutions was recorded regardless of the smaller sample size (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were higher in general compared to the ND1 data. Most notably, all four CO1 haplotypes in 2009 occurred only in this year and no common haplotype was detected. Shared haplotypes were found between the years 2004, 2010, 2012 and 2013 and between the latter and 2007. Additionally, more “generation” specific private haplotypes were present for CO1 than for ND1 again regardless of the smaller sample size (see
