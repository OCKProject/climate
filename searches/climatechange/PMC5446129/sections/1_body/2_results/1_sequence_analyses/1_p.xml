<p class="p">Sequencing of the ND1 gene fragment was successfully performed for 200 individuals. The resulting alignment was 509 bp long and contained seven variable nucleotide positions. For the CO1 fragment 38 variable sites were scored in a 601 bp long alignment including a subset of 84 individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coerulescens</italic> for the analyzed years. For ND1 eight haplotypes were detected in total (GenBank Accessions KY807703—KY807710), CO1 shows 15 haplotypes (GenBank Accessions KY807688—KY807702). The number of haplotypes per year varied between both markers. It ranges from one to four for ND1, with a maximum of three private haplotypes for the generation in the year 2013 (
