<p class="p">Allele frequencies for each locus per year are visualized in the supplementary data. For almost all loci different patterns in allele composition before and after 2004 can be found. In detail, for locus H04 and J04 different alleles dominated in the years 1989, 1998 and 2004 compared to the period from 2007 onwards. Furthermore, the number of alleles decreased after 2004 and rare alleles were lost, as most notable for locus F04 (
