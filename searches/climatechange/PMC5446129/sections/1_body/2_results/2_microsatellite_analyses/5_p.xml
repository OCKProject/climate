<p class="p">To analyze the population structure via a multi-locus genotype data the model-based analysis was applied as implemented in STRUCTURE [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Microsatellite data of all individuals were clustered (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> clusters); each cluster is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Clusters were inferred without any predefined sets. Results revealed two main groups of individuals, containing populations from 1989, 1998 and 2004 in one group. Whereas populations from 2007 onwards were defined as the second genetic cluster (see
