<p class="p">In total, 122 alleles were scored for the analyzed populations between 1989 and 2011 and the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 17. Allelic diversity parameters are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Allelic diversity (A) ranged from 5.5 to 9.7, averaged for the six analyzed loci. The highest value was found for the year 1998 (9.7) with a dramatic decline to 5.5 in the sampling period in 2007. Allelic richness (A
 <sub class="sub">RC</sub>), corrected for the smallest sample size, showed less variation ranging from 5.19 to 5.42 per population and locus for all studied years. The number of alleles scored within populations ranged from 33 in 2007 to 58 in 1998 with at least one private allele found in each year. The highest number of private alleles was scored in the year 1998 with a total number of eight. Observed heterozygosities across all loci ranged from 0.541 in 1989 to 0.770 in 2011 (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) showing a rising trend.
