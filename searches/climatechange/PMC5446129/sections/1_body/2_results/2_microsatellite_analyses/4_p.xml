 <xref rid="pone.0178014.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), indicating that individuals of these years might be less closely related than expected under a model assuming random mating but the overall genetic differentiation is low. The lowest

  <italic class="italic">IS</italic>
 </sub> value can be found in the population of 2008 with -0.257. For the years 1989, 1998 and 2004 positive and higher values can be observed in contrast. This implies a possible higher degree of inbreeding within these years as in the following years. The highest value (0.163) is scored in the year 1998 (
