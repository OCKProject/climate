<p class="p">All populations have at least one locus with significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Generations in the years 1989, 1998 and 2004 displayed three to six loci with highly significant deviance from the HWE indicating a heterozygosity deficit. Generations after 2004 experienced a (less) significant heterozygous excess. The average of the observed heterozygosity is lower than expected from 1989 to 2007 and from thereon higher than expected, reaching values up to 0.77 in 2011 (see
