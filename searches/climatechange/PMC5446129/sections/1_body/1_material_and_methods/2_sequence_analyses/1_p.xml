Two mitochondrial gene fragments were amplified: the ND1 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1) fragment, including partial 16S rRNA and tRNALeu, as well as the CO1 (Cytochrom oxidase subunit 1) fragment for which the primer pair OdoCO1 fw 5´&gt;TAC ACG AGC ATA TTT TAC TTC AGC&lt;3´ and OdoCo1 rev 5´&gt;CTT AAA TCC ATT GCA CTT TTC&gt;3´ was designed as an odonate specific CO1 marker. The resulting 600bp long fragment is not located within the traditional barcode region. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out regarding the protocol of Abraham
