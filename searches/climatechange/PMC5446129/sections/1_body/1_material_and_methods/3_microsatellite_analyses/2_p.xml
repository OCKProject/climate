<p class="p">Genetic diversity parameters of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coeruelscens</italic> populations between the sampled years were assessed by comparing allele frequencies, expected heterozygosity (H
 <sub class="sub">E</sub>), observed heterozygosity (H
 <sub class="sub">O</sub>), and allelic richness (A) for each locus via the software FSTAT (version 2.9.3.2; [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]). Inbreeding coefficients (WrightÂ´s 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-statistics) were calculated with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">IS</sub>, based on observed heterozygosities as well as 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values based on expected heterozygosities with the software ARLEQUIN (version 3.5.1.2; [

 </sub> values between all population pairs were additionally assessed and p-values were calculated using 1000 permutations. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the probabilities for conformity with Hardy-Weinberg proportions and linkage disequilibrium were calculated using the Markov chain method implemented in GENEPOP (version 4.0.10, [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). STRUCTURE (version 2.1; [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]) was used to conduct a Bayesian multi-locus clustering as implemented in the software, based on a model clustering method for unlinked markers to estimate population structure by genotype data. Prior population definitions were ignored and all individuals were placed into 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> populations (with 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> unknown), which were clustered by distinctive allele frequencies. In accordance with the number of sampled years, runs with 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> values from one to seven were repeated 20 times using the admixture model with correlated frequencies. Runs were performed with a burn-in period of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> steps followed by 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> Markov chain Monte Carlo replicates. The online version of STRUCTURE HARVESTER [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] was applied to estimate the most significant 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> out of the STRUCTURE run result files.
