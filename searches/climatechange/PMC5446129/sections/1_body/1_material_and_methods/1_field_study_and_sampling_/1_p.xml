 <italic class="italic">Canal de Vergières</italic> (CdV) in southern France, located in the “nature heritage”, the Crau (43°36'17.7"N 4°48'34.4"E). Together with the adjacent Camargue, the Crau is one of Europe’s richest odonate biotopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Decades of non-protection of this region resulted in its extensive use for agriculture. Many irrigation ditches were built cutting through this region. One of them, the CdV, is 13km long and famous for its remarkable odonate species richness. It is the breeding site for at least 32 dragonfly species [

 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. For the monitoring a 1.5 km long segment in the nature reserve Peau de Meau (belonging to the nature reserve Coussouls de Crau) was chosen. Here, we expected the most stable conditions due to the conservation status of this specific part of the channel. From the beginning of our monitoring in 1989 until 1995 the habitat structure of the CdV remained nearly undisturbed. During the winter months of 1996 the sediment of the ditch was dredged out and all bank vegetation was destroyed in order to maintain flow velocity.
