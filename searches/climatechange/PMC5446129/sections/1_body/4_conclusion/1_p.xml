<p class="p">Genetic analyses of data collected over a period of more than 20 years to the 
 <italic class="italic">Orthetrum coerulescens</italic> at the CdV in Southern France revealed an overall low genetic diversity and a population decline between the years 2004 and 2007. Afterwards the population shows a stabilizing trend but is not reaching the amount of genetic variation from 1989. Surprisingly, the decline cannot be referred to the clearing of the canal in 1996, an anthropogenic event assumed to have great negative impact to the larval population of the target species. Instead, it is most likely that the populationsâ€™ decay was due to extreme climate conditions in 2004 and the following two years. Based on this local monitoring scheme we now can conclude that for the viability of this highly habitat specific insect species it might be important to study the effects of climate change to its riverine ecosystems on a long term basis and in a global setting.
