<p class="p">Genetic monitoring of species provides important and often novel information of their actual status. Long-term studies are able to detect population’s trends and may offer a background for management plans. Long-term projects were recently defined by a period of “at least 3 years” observation of the target species [

The application of a pair of population sensitive mtDNA markers and a panel of microsatellites revealed a significant cut and change in the population´s genetic make-up during the survey which was unexpectedly not caused by a direct anthropogenic impact and the following significant population decline.
