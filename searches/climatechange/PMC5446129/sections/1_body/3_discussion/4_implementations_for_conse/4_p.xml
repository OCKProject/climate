<p class="p">In sum, only the long-term genetic monitoring data could reveal that the population of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coerulescens</italic> at the CdV is rather affected by natural factors, like extreme weather conditions than by direct anthropogenic impacts. The population decline between 2004 and 2007 was not noticed by conventional surveys on this species abundance. The low genetic diversity despite a large population size and subsequent decrease of the ability to deal with environmental changes cannot be determined by traditional monitoring efforts. This stresses the value of long-term data sets on a regional scale for population genetics and conservation biology in order to understand the causal mechanisms on small scales behind global changes.
