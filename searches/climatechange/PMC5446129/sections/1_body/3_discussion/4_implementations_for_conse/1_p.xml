<p class="p">A combination of both, extreme and unlikely weather conditions is most likely the cause for the population decline between 2004 and 2007. In contrast, the clearing of the canal did not lead to a comparable dramatic effect. We assume that this local event could be compensated by (i) the surviving individuals and (ii) migration of closely related

Adult densities in contrast decreased after the dredging, consequently a higher amount of inbreeding is expected (see

In the Crau we find a network of canals, from which the CdV with its largest population is most likely displaying the source-habitat under a metapopulation model. Indeed, by capture-mark-recapture analyses we could confirm that

Consequently, after a drastic local population depletion due to the dredging a recolonization by sink-individuals would not only slowly stabilize the population size, but also cause the unexpected gain of genetic diversity we observed between 1989 and 1998.
