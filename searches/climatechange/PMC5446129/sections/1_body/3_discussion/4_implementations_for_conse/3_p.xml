<p class="p">Small freshwater ecosystems in general and riverine ecosystems in special are increasingly prone to environmental change, especially in arid as well as developed landscapes [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The artificial channels in the Crau cannot recruit groundwater in consequence of the special soil conditions. But here lies a chance for conservation management in this sensitive ecosystem, as the water levels in artificial irrigation ditches can be managed. Consequently, a managed water supply in drought periods as conservational effort in order to protect the unique odonate fauna (and other aquatic insects) in this sensitive ecosystem would be highly desirable. However, for natural small creeks this opportunity does not exists. We assume that our findings translate to other sensitive, riverine dragonfly species, as well as riverine aquatic insects in the Mediterranean area.
