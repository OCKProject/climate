<p class="p">A change in climatic parameters affects the ecosystem on a larger scale. Extreme weather conditions like the recorded drought periods influence all freshwater habitats in the Crau. Hence, local population declines or even extinctions cannot be compensated out of a genetic metapopulation because all habitats of

The change in the genetic make-up of the CdV population we detected after 2004 can only be explained by genetic drift due to changing ecological conditions and immigration of less related individuals to the former population. Consequently, we observed an increase in heterozygosity and
