<p class="p">The mitochondrial markers ND1 and CO1 were successfully used in several odonate population genetic studies [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In this study they revealed an unexpected low genetic diversity for one of the largest known 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coerulescens</italic> populations in France, with only eight haplotypes for ND1 and 15 for CO1 in total (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 200/84 individuals, respectively). The maximum number of haplotypes per generation was four (ND1) and six (CO1), respectively. Especially for ND1 higher variations are known for libellulid dragonflies demonstrated for example for 
 <italic class="italic">Trithemis arteriosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Crocothemis erythrea</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] at comparable population sample sizes. Despite the smaller sample size of the CO1 dataset (used to proof the trend), a higher degree of variation can be recorded in terms of the number of (private) haplotypes as well as haplotype and nucleotide diversity. In other odonate studies CO1 mirrors ND1 data analyses [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In some years the two markers are not congruent, but the low genetic diversity is consistent between both datasets. The speciesÂ´ environment might be a major driver of the genetic pattern since riverine odonates are highly restricted to their habitats and show less dispersal potential than other species adapted to a less stable habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. As dispersal is one of the major drivers for genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0178014.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] a higher diversity between and within populations can be assumed for good dispersers and generalists like 
 <italic class="italic">Trithemis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Crocothemis</italic> (see above).
