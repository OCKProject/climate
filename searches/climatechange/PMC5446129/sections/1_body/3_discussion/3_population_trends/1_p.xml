<p class="p">For the years 1989 and 1998 adult densities were observed along the CdV in 20m long transects in July/ August three times a day between 11.00 a.m. to 16.00 p.m. Before dredging (1989), the average density was 28.5 individuals per transect whereas after this event only 7.6 individuals were found in 1998. The larval densities dropped from 35–40 individuals per square meter to 9–15 Ind/qm. All the very few other potential habitats in the surrounding (in 25km radius) had low population densities as well [

Despite the fact that population sizes were very high (except for 1998) overall variation and between the generations was low and the mitochondrial markers revealed no clear pattern of fluctuation in genetic metrics over the analyzed time period. Analyses of the microsatellite loci showed greater variation and a clear pattern that allows assumptions on population’s history, viability and trends.
