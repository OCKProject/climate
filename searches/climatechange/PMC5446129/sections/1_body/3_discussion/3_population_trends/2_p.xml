<p class="p">Interestingly, the highest diversity regarding the number of alleles, private alleles and alleles per locus was scored in 1998, which was only two years after the dredging event, indicating that the dredging had not affected the populationâ€™s viability. This result is interestingly contradicting the population density data that indeed show a dramatic decline after the dredging. Both the larval and adult density dropped significantly. From 1989 to 1998 the population showed an increasing trend in terms of all analyzed genetic diversity parameters. After 1998 genetic diversity decreased, with a significant decline between 2004 and 2007. Individuals showed then the lowest allelic diversity (A
 <sub class="sub">locus</sub> 5.5 from former 9.0 in 2004) and values remained low but stabilized in the following years up to 6.7 in 2011.
