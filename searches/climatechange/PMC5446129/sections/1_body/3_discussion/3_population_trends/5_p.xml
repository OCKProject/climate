<p class="p">During this time period there was no anthropogenic impact on the canal, e.g. dredging. Instead a severe drought in 2003 was observed, followed by extreme hot and dry summers during 2004 to 2007. Although the CdV did not dry out, the water level was much lower than usual with no flow velocity (personal Information: Axel Wolff, Conservateur de la RNN des Coussouls de Crau). As the larvae of

In contrast, for the year 2006 very low temperatures in the winter month and spring were recorded. Minimal average temperatures remained below freezing even until April in this year (personal Information: Axel Wolff, Conservateur de la RNN des Coussouls de Crau). Low temperatures in general do not affect most speciesâ€™ larval development as they contain polyhydroxyethanols preventing them from freezing [
