<p class="p">Observed heterozygosity increased over the whole time period, also from 1989 to 1998 regardless the demographic bottleneck in 1996. Between 2004 and 2007 though, the same genetic change could be detected. In sum, these three generations (1989, 1998 and 2004) displayed more loci with highly significant deviances from HWE as any other generations, indicating a heterozygosity deficit. Whereas generations after 2004 revealed less significant values and assuming a heterozygote excess, which is the typical sign of the genetic bottleneck [
