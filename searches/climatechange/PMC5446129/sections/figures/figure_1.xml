  <title class="title">Mutational haplotype network for a) the CO1 and b) the ND1 gene fragment based on statistical parsimony.</title>
  <p class="p">Shown are the genealogical relationships between the haplotypes of 
   <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">coerulescens</italic> in the years 1989 to 2013 at the Canal de Vergi√®res. The considered ancestral haplotypes are depicted as rectangles, all other haplotypes as circles. Missing mutational steps connecting haplotypes are represented by small non-colored dots. Haplotypes connected by a single line differ in one mutational step. The size of the rectangle and circles correlates with haplotype frequency within each network. The different colors represent the different years, haplotype frequency is given in numbers if greater than one.
