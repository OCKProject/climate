 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00039-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, to show the basic properties of all the variables in this study. The purpose of this study is to find the mean yield, cropping area, and production for all the major crops. In the case of yield, it was found that among the four crops, the mean yield of sugarcane was the highest. According to this study, the observed mean yield of the four crops in descending order is as follows: sugarcane &gt; maize &gt; wheat &gt; rice. In the case of average production, sugarcane ranked the highest, wheat stood second, maize third, and rice ranked the last. According to the average production area, wheat ranked first, and sugarcane, maize, and rice stood second, third, and fourth place, respectively. In case of climate variables, the highest maximum temperature was noticed in the rice growing season and the lowest maximum temperature was observed in the wheat growing season. In contrast, the highest minimum temperature was observed in the rice growing season, while the lowest minimum temperature was noticed in the wheat growing season. For rainfall, rice received the highest rainfall in growing season; maize and sugarcane were in second and third place, while wheat received the lowest total rainfall. In view of relative humidity, the highest percentage of humidity was detected in the sugarcane growing season, while the lowest value was detected in the maize growing season. Finally, in the case of sunshine, the highest sunshine was observed in the rice growing season and lowest was seen in the wheat season. This study will also determine which climatic variable affect food crops the most severely in Pakistan.
