<p class="p">To determine the influence of the climatic variables on the rice crop yield, the FGLS method was employed. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00039-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, which showed that the effects of all the climatic parameters except the maximum temperature were observed to be significant for the yield of the rice crop. Minimum temperature caused a negative effect and non-significant influence on the yield of the rice crop.
