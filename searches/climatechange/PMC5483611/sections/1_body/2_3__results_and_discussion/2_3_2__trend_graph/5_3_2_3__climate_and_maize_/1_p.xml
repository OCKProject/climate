<p class="p">Maize is an important food crop and a raw material for many products. The production of maize decreased by five percent from 4.6944 million tonnes to 4.695 million tonnes during the period 2013–2014 to 2014–2015 [
 <xref rid="B89-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>].The HAC method was performed to determine the climate change and maize yield relationship, and the findings are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00039-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Results revealed that both maximum temperature and minimum temperature were found to be positive and non-significant. Relative humidity showed a statistically significant contribution to the yield of maize crop, but it negatively influenced the yield of crops. Both rainfall and sunshine showed no statistically significant contribution, and negatively influenced the yield of the maize crop. The adjusted R² value indicated that about 39% of the variation in the maize crop yield is explained by the climatic parameters.
