<p class="p">Sugarcane is planted in Pakistan in autumn and spring seasons, mostly under rainfed conditions. FGLS method was used to obtain the contribution of the climatic variables to the yield of sugarcane. The results indicated that maximum temperature is statistically significant and has a positive influence on the crop yield. Both minimum temperature and relative humidity showed a statistically significant relation and positively influenced the yield. Rainfall and sunshine both showed a negative influence on sugarcane crop yield. Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and relative humidity all showed a statistically significant relationship.</p>
