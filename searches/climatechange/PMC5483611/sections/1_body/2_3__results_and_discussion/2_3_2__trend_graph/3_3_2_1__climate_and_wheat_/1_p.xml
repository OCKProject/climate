<p class="p">Wheat is the leading staple food crop of Pakistan, and hence the food security policy focuses mainly on the production of wheat. Wheat is deemed important due to its extensive use as a food and a relatively cheaper source for animal feed. The sowing period for wheat is winter and it is harvested in summer. Low temperature is conducive for the growth of wheat, while high temperature can cause a delay in seedling growth. Similarly, rainfall pattern causes damage to the production of wheat at harvesting time, ultimately leading to a situation of food insecurity in the country [
