 <xref ref-type="table" rid="foods-06-00039-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Maximum temperature showed a significant and negative influence on yield. Minimum temperature also showed a statistically significant influence, and the contribution was also found to be positive on yield. In the case of rainfall, it showed a non-significant influence and a negative contribution to the yield of wheat. Both the relative humidity and the sunshine expressed or showed non-significant influence, while relative humidity displayed negative effects. The sunshine showed a positive effect on yield. The adjusted
