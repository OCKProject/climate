 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-06-00039-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The trend in minimum temperature appears to be increasing. Rainfall fluctuated greatly, especially in rice growing season, and trends show an increasing rate. During the wheat and maize growing seasons, rainfall showed a slight decrease in overall trend, while rainfall also showed slight variations in the sugarcane growing season (
