<p class="p">Climate change is a global environmental threat to all economic sectors—specifically the agricultural sector. Pakistan has faced extreme weather events like untimely and heavy rainfall and flash floods in mountainous areas affecting huge damage to the major crops and properties of farmers. It is expected that the above-mentioned situation will increase as a function of climate change. Paying attention to the significance of agriculture to the country’s economy and rural livelihoods, the importance of climate change adaptation approaches is critical. Even though the adaptation strategies are very important, all farmers do not use such strategies. The majority of rural households and connected urban populations in developing countries as well as in Pakistan are highly dependent on agriculture. Therefore, adaptation to the negative impacts due to climate variability may be essential to encourage food security for the country and to protect the subsistence of rural households.</p>
