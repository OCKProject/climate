<p class="p">The prime aim of this study was to analyze the impact of climate change (e.g., maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and sunshine) on major food crops of Pakistan, including wheat, rice, maize, and the cash crop sugarcane. The HAC and FGLS methods were employed to achieve the objectives and obtained mixed results. Some climate variables affect the crop yield negatively and significantly, while others are not significant. The most influential climatic variables for wheat crop production in Pakistan were observed to be maximum temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. The finding confirmed that maximum temperature is significant and negatively influenced the yield of wheat crop, while rainfall and relative humidity are both insignificant and negatively influenced wheat crop yield. The influence of maximum temperature is significant for the rice crop. Both temperature and relative humidity displayed positive interrelation with sugarcane crop yield. Overall, climate change has adverse impacts on the yield of major food crops. Almost 60 percent of the Pakistani population is living below the poverty line. Moreover, the population is growing rapidly and the country will face the problem of food security in the near future. The government needs to take firm action to overcome this problem and ensure sufficient food for the masses.</p>
