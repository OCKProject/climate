The large population in South Asian countries is dependent on rural economies based on agriculture; hence, these areas are especially affected by climate changes. This causes serious threats to their social, economic, and ecological systems [

The World Bankâ€™s South Asia Climate Change Strategy announced that the poorest people in the region will be affected the most by climate change due to limited assets, unfavorable geography, and a greater dependence on climate-sensitive sources of income. Extreme weather events at high frequency in the region in recent years (e.g., flash floods in Pakistan and India) are thought to be directly associated with climate change and are likely to keep the poor in a perennial poverty trap [
