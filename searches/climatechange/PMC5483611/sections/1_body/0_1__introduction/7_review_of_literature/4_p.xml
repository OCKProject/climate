<p class="p">Global agricultural production is challenged by climate change [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Climate change affects different crops and regions differently, but it is generally expected that agricultural productivity will decline [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In fact, some decline can already be seen. According to one calculation, climate change resulted in the reduction of global maize yield by 3.8% between 1980 and 2010 [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Farmers were not threatened evenly compared to crops, but they were the most vulnerable group to climate change [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Economic losses from extreme weather conditions are increasing due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. It is projected that average temperature will increase and patterns of rainfall will change. Consequently, it is likely that more intense events and floods will occur in the coming decades. This will greatly affect the community in terms of rescue operations, loss of human life, damage to assets, and disruption of business [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. It is difficult for the government to pay for the damages. Crop productivity is affected by climate change, with serious implications for food security [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Global warming has been hypothesized to boost yields, as increasing atmospheric carbon acts as a fertilizer effect, but the impacts are probably negative overall for poor countries. For instance, there will be a reduction of food production in countries near to the equator due to global warming [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. There will be extended droughts and food shortages in African countries. There will be more poverty and other social troubles in Pacific Islands and Indonesia, as these countries are more dependent on imports. A recent International Water Management Institute (IWMI) study forecasts that wheat production in South Asia will decline by 50% by 2050 [
