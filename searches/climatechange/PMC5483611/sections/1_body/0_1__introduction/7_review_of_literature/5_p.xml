<p class="p">The agriculture sector is highly dependent on alterations in climatic conditions, thus making it a dangerous activity. Climate variability is a major source of risk for agriculture and food systems. The increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather have extensively flawed agriculture [

 <xref rid="B34-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>].There are five major risk factors, as follows: production risks linked with changes in crop yields and livestock from many sources (i.e., unpredictable weather conditions, disease incidence, and pests). Secondly, there are financial risks, such as a farmerâ€™s capacity to pay their bills to sustain farming and avoid liquidation. Thirdly, marketing risks, which involve variations in the prices of agricultural products. Fourth, there are legal and environmental risks, and finally there are narrow human resources (i.e., a lack of family members to play the role of labor and farm management). As a consequence, there is a negative impact on production, leading to huge production losses. It is therefore important for farmers to perceive and regulate production risks appropriately [
