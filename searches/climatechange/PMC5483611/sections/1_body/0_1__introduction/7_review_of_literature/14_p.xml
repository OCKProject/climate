<p class="p">Adaptation to climate change is taken to reduce the negative impact of climate change. Moreover, adaptation could be classified into spatial (both localized and widespread), and may also be in the form of behavioral, technological, institutional, informational, and financial adaptations [

 <xref rid="B64-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Adaptation has been explained in terms of vulnerability to climate change. Hence, adaptation to climate change is linked with the perception of what climate change is. This is how individuals or groups have to respond to the change in climate. The perception of an individual depends on her experience and knowledge and the observed impact of climate change. For instance, when there was a change in temperature in 11 African countries, the farmers changed crop varieties, increased conservation of water, and switched to non-farm activities [

Similarly in a study conducted for South Africa and Ethiopia including 1800 farmer households, it was observed that the strategies commonly adopted by farmers consist of planting different crops and varieties, cultivating trees, practicing soil conservation, and changing dates of planting and irrigation [

However, it was observed that farmers who did not adopt any adaptation strategy revealed that lacking credit, lack of information, and access to land were the major factors which obstructed them from adapting to perceived change in climate [
