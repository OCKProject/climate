<p class="p">Because of disparate climatic conditions, the susceptibility index of climate change in Pakistan is very high as compared to several countries around the globe. Recently, the country has faced climatic changes including enhanced temperature, variations in precipitation pattern, weather shift, floods, earthquakes, and more. Pakistan—though not a major contributor to emissions that have resulted in creating the climate change situation—has a high vulnerability index. The needs for its adaptation to new changes are very high [

Since 2010, the agricultural sector in Pakistan has faced three gigantic floods that had overwhelming effects on the whole economy, and predominantly the agriculture sector. A massive destruction in 2010, 2011, and 2014 to agricultural crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries occurred due to monsoon floods and also caused damage to key infrastructure such as animal shelters, tube wells, fertilizers, houses, water channels, people, seed stocks, and agricultural equipment. Before the harvesting season of the main crops including wheat, rice, maize, sugarcane, and vegetables, a devastating flood occurred. An approximate loss in production of 13.3 million tons was recorded due to the yield loss of major crops. Standing crops worth 2 million hectares were destroyed, while 1.2 million livestock including poultry were lost to the flood of 2010 [

Another gigantic flood came in 2011 in the provinces of Baluchistan and Sindh that severely affected these provinces and also the people living in them in the sense of loss of lives, particularly concerning to agricultural activities and issues. About 80% of the population living in the rural areas of Sindh is reliant upon agricultural activities for their livelihoods, fisheries, crops, forestry, and livestock [

The flood ruined standing crops of rice, sugar cane, vegetables and pulses, sorghum, cotton, and livestock, along with heavy losses of lives in 2011. For instance, around 115,500 livestock were killed; about 5 million livestock survived, but they were also obliquely affected through disease and dislocation. The predictable total loss was US$1840.3 million, out of which 89% was direct damage and 11% indirect victims. The maximum damage (about US$1.84 billion) happened in the agricultural sector, predominantly to livestock and fisheries. The total damage of US$3.7 billion has been estimated due to floods in 2011. The total cost of US$2.7 billion has been estimated for revival and rehabilitation [

More than 2.5 million people were affected by heavy rains and floods, and 367 persons died in the current floods in September 2014. Furthermore, 250,000 farmers, 129,880 houses, and more than 1 million acres of cultivated land were affected. The cost of recovery and resilience building were estimated at US$439.7 million and US$56.2 million, respectively [
