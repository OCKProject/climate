<p class="p">Agriculture and food security can be affected by change in climate for many reasons, such as the rainfall distribution and the availability of capital, water, biodiversity, land, and global resources. This may increase doubts on the food chain ranging from farm to fork and result in trade dynamics, and eventually affect the global economy, food security, and the capability to nourish 9 billion people by 2050. Modeling by International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IIASA) showed that irrigation requirements at the regional or global level may affect the climatic conditions, agricultural water withdrawals, and future socioeconomics [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. It is also observed that this irrigation requirement may increase by up to 45% by 2080. Even with upgrades in the irrigation system, overall there may be 20% water withdrawals increases. Global irrigation supplement with change in climate will boost by 20% above the reference base case scenario (exclusive of climate change). The reproduction shows that climate change largely affects irrigation water requirements globally similar to the increase in irrigation due to socioeconomic development. Climate change has little impact on global food production, but its geographic distribution is uneven. For example, there are more losses in Africa and South Asia representing arid and sub-humid areas [
