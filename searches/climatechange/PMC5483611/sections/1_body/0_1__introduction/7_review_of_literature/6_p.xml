<p class="p">The results of the study show that more than 50% of farmers were risk hostile in nature, and they had high perceptions about floods. In case of economic loss, flooding is the most calamitous natural disaster. All studies revealed that farmers were the most affected in terms of damages to crops, water contamination, irrigation systems, livestock, and other agricultural operations. Moreover, losses in farm yield and security increased due to the negative impacts of floods on agricultural systems. The same results were obtained by [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Due to these tremendous losses to agriculture production in 2010, 2011, and 2014, farmers considered floods and heavy rains to carry much greater risk than other natural disasters. This high risk-perception of farmers resulted in a high-risk-averse attitude in farmers. The results for risk aversion were related with the findings of [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. They announced that the majority of farmers in their studies were risk averse in nature. Education was crucial among socioeconomic factors because it affected the risk aversion behavior of farmers. Educated farmers may be capable of successful perceptions and adoption to minimize or avoid risk due to their understanding and knowledge. These findings for the link of education with risk aversion are correlated with the following findings [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. According to their study, most of the educated farmers in the Philippines were risk averse in nature compared to illiterate farmers. The same findings for education and risk attitudes of farmers were also reported in [

 <xref rid="B46-foods-06-00039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. They described that as their education augmented, farmers were less risk averse in nature. In terms of experience, our findings showed that there is more risk aversion in highly experienced farmers as compared to those having less experience. Experienced farmers are less likely to confront the natural disasters because of their indigenous knowledge about prevailing environment and weather conditions. These findings are also related to the findings of others (e.g., [
