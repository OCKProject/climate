<p class="p">Generally, climate change has minor effects on global food production, but these effects are unevenly distributed geographically. Most of the losses are suffered in lower-income countries, such as those in arid and sub-humid South Asia and Africa. These regions are engaged in subsistence agriculture, and are not technically sound or financially strong enough to abate the negative impacts of climate change. Moreover, they have almost no potential for adaptation [

According to estimates of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the global number of undernourished people is 795 million. This shows a decline of nearly 200 million over the last 20 years [

In addition, climate change can pose threats to agriculture and food security by changing the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, water availability, land, capital, biodiversity, and terrestrial resources. Due to changes in agricultural production, it could potentially cause food uncertainty for 9 billion people by 2050. Research shows that regional and global water requirements can be altered due to climate change and can trigger a shortage of water for agricultural purposes.
