<p class="p">Pakistan’s economy is based on the agricultural sector because of its contribution to the total income of the country. The agricultural sector serves as a source of livelihood for 42.3 percent of rural inhabitants and contributes 19.8 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. The prime objective of the agricultural sector is to ensure food security and reduce poverty by increasing production. The country is extremely vulnerable to climate change due to its geographical location, high population, and low technological resource base. Pakistan suffered economic losses of more than US$15 billion during the floods of 2010. About 300,000 people were displaced, and more than 20 million seriously affected. Pakistan needs US $6–14 billion annually to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Some of the gifts of climate change to Pakistan are the floods of 2013, 2011, and 2010, extreme droughts of 1999–2003, and the cyclones in Karachi/Gwadar in 2008 which led to landslides and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFS) in Northern Pakistan. Climate change poses a serious challenge to Pakistan by threatening its food, water, and energy security owing to a possible change in weather pattern, extreme events such as floods, droughts, and heat waves, and reduces agricultural productivity. About 5000 glaciers in Pakistan are retreating, and their retreat speed is faster than the rest of the world [
