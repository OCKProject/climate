<p class="p">The policy makers of Pakistan mainly focus on wheat, as it is an important staple food. In Pakistan, wheat is an important food crop due to its extensive use as a food in daily life and as a cheaper source for animal feeding. Out of a 22.45 million ha cultivated area, only 6.34 million ha land is irrigated by canal water, and nearly 12.52 million ha is cultivated through tube wells and other sources. There is no availability of water for the remaining 3.59 million ha [

Currently, about 26 MAF (million acre feet) of water is available for cultivation of wheat, which is lower than the required amount by approximately 28.6 percent [

It is expected that in the near future, the availability of water would decrease sharply, as would the production of agriculture sector.
