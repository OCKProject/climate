<p class="p">It is expected that each crop needs certain conditions for growth and survival, such as soil moisture (water), optimum temperature, adequate sunshine, and atmospheric humidity. According to one study, temperature (both maximum and minimum) enhances photosynthesis as it increases and leads to an increase in crop yield [

It can lead to soil erosion, washing out of soil surface, and depletion of nutrients in the soil. Devastating flood can destroy crops, leaving no food for farmers to eat and sell, and thus can trigger production and food security problems [

Humidity that is too low or too high is not beneficial for higher crop yield. When humidity is sufficient, plants can absorb nutrients from the soil and can provide a high yield. Plantâ€“water relationship is directly controlled by humidity and indirectly by the growth of leaves, rates of photosynthesis, pollination, disease occurrence, and lastly, crops yield. Furthermore, dryness in the atmosphere can seriously threaten dry matter production by controlling stomatal leaf water potential [

As we know, plants directly depend on sunshine for their healthy growth and development, completion of their life cycle, and most importantly, food preparation. In contrast, excessive sunshine has similar negative effects on crops (e.g., extreme temperature) [
