<p id="p0015" class="p">Melbourne Gardens, one of two botanic gardens managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria (the other is Cranbourne Gardens, including the award-winning Australian Garden), is universally recognised as one of the most beautiful and stunning botanical landscapes in the world. For 170 years it has been home to a diverse collection of plants from across the globe, some of them rare and threatened with extinction, others awe-inspiring for their size, beauty or botanical curiosity. As custodians of this living masterpiece, the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria has to plan for more than the next few years. Our ‘planning horizon’ should be calibrated more towards the life of a tree – a century or two. On that scale, climate change looms large. In 2002, the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria embarked on an ambitious project (Working Wetlands) to collect, treat and distribute storm water from within and around the Melbourne Gardens. The combined infrastructure of a wetland filtration system, water treatment centre and complementary landscaping confirmed our reputation as world leaders in integrated water management. In 2016, we took the next step, adapting our living collections and landscape to the likely impacts of climate change.</p>
