<p id="p0220" class="p">With the Landscape Succession Strategy completed, and its implementation commenced, the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria is armed and ready to respond to the impending changes to Melbourne's climate. We are confident we will succeed in retaining all the qualities of the landscape and diversity of the collections that give our Melbourne Gardens its much-celebrated cultural and scientific significance. We do know that more research is needed: to find the tolerance envelope for species we want to grow for cultural, scientific and conservation reasons; to source and/or breed genotypes of signature species more able to cope with the predicted climate; and to continue to question each of our accessions as to what its purpose is in this particular botanic garden (which might range from landscape structure, to preservation of a species, to wowing and inspiring visitors), To do all this we need to continue to foster in-house skills and to continue to encourage partnerships with universities and other research organisations. We will draw on our networks of botanic gardens within Victoria, Australia and internationally to share and gather information, and plant material (already we have attracted considerable interest from botanic gardens within Australia and overseas to use our Landscape Success Strategy as a blueprint for responding to climate change). And we need to keep up with advances in science and technology to provide essentials such as reliable irrigation water (it may even be that through innovation we can provide more water, or reduce temperatures locally, and mitigate some of the effects of climate change).</p>
