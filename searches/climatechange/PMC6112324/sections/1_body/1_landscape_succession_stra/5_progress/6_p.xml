 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lam et al. (2016)</xref> mapped the microclimate (relative humidity and temperature) at 18 locations across Melbourne Gardens to assist in landscape planning (
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 12</xref>). It was found that for warm days, 30 °C or above, Fern Gully was up to 6 °C cooler in maximum temperature than Melbourne City. This was expected but interestingly our Oak Lawn, a woodland setting with large mature trees and mown turf, also attained similar temperature readings. This supports the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shashua-Bar et al. (2009)</xref> on the synergistic cooling relationships between irrigated turf and shading by overhead tree canopies. Mean air temperature differences on selected warm days for Fern Gully and Oak Lawn were 2.7 °C and 2.1 °C cooler respectively than Melbourne City. The data highlight areas we can promote to visitors on very hot days (e.g. above 40 °C) and areas we can develop for better human thermal comfort (
