<p id="p0025" class="p">Aside from the choice of species, we have to manage competition from established specimens, tend our soil, and capture and store as much water as possible. A changing climate can also bring biosecurity threats – new pests and diseases, as well as increased virulence of those already among us – and increased wear and tear on our built landscape, including the magnificent shelters and the graceful, but now very cracked and lumpy, paths. We'll continue to work with other botanic gardens throughout Victoria, Australia and internationally, to conserve particular examples of our rare and threatened flora, already under threat from loss of habitat, encroaching weeds and antipathetic land management. Climate change only adds to the urgency for seed banking, propagation, interpretation and restoration.</p>
