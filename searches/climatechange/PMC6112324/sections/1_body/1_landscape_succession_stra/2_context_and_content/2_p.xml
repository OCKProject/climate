Ambitious but achievable targets are set, including the kind of research and data needed to make evidence-based decisions. While no doubt you'll see more drought tolerant plants in Melbourne Gardens, it's not all about cacti and succulents. It's also about planting with new temperature regimes in view— ‘heat tolerance’ will need to become more part of the Australian plant selection vernacular! The Happy Tree (or Xi Shu; 
 <italic class="italic">Camptotheca acuminata</italic>) beside the William Tell Rest House and the Rainbow Gum (
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus deglupta</italic>) at the end of Fern Gully are both water-loving trees doing very nicely beside our lakes. On the other hand, the Mexican Blue Palm (
 <italic class="italic">Brahea armata</italic>), prominent in the Guilfoyle's Volcano landscape, is a good example of an attractive and unusual plant we would recommend for drier situations. The Forest Elder (
 <italic class="italic">Nuxia floribunda</italic>) from Africa is expected to withstand the predicted higher temperatures but as a typical riparian species would likely require a situation with some available water. Each species is to be assessed on its merit, using the best available information on its climate preferences and tolerance, as well as the very best botanical and horticultural experience and expertise.
