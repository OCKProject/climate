   <p id="p0100" class="p">By 2090, the climate for Melbourne is projected to be hotter (+3 °C in Mean Annual Temperature) and drier (−9% Mean Annual Precipitation), with an increased probability of extreme events such as heat waves and floods (
    <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Webb and Hennessy, 2015</xref>; RCP 8.5 scenario). Prior to the 1950s, Melbourne City's Mean Annual Temperature was 14.7 °C (1856–1949) rising to 16.1 °C for the last 30-year period of 1986–2015 (

Managing water scarcity is a relatively easier task (if resources are not limiting) however, bandwidth increases in ambient temperature and frequency of very hot days cannot be readily mitigated at the landscape scale and a shift towards higher temperature suited taxa will be essential.

   <p id="p0110" class="p">Through water use efficiency programs in place since 1994, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria has already reduced its annual landscape water demand in Melbourne Gardens by over 50% (or 70% if stormwater use offset is included). However, all the cost-effective stormwater catchments are now in full use to recover urban runoff. Groundwater supplies are considered too limited and saline for landscape irrigation. The remaining options include reuse of waste water – i.e. sewage or saline water – but these have very high capital and operating costs (although they may become economically competitive during the life of the Strategy). Currently the most feasible option being considered is sourcing water from the nearby Yarra River, upstream of the tidal influence, and through a ‘buy back’ of an existing but no-longer used water licence where most of the water will return to environmental flows but some to landscape irrigation. This scheme is being considered as a precinct-wide option in this part of Melbourne, which also includes many other iconic greens spaces within the city.</p>

   <p id="p0120" class="p">Cultivated landscapes — even those of heritage character — are in a state of constant flux due to intrinsic dynamics of the living (e.g. tree ageing and dying) and built (e.g. paths and buildings) environment, but also changing expectations around their use and values, and now (and perhaps always) a changing climate. A major challenge is perception – it is easy for the visitor to think that what they see is what has always been. Interestingly, an examination of old photographs from W R Guilfoyle's tenure (1873–1909) as Director and principal landscape designer of Melbourne Gardens appears to show a more austere and xerophytic landscape. Which makes sense when we consider the water supply challenges of those times. However visitors today tend to view any shift to more drought-tolerant plants as straying from the original intent of Guilfoyle's stunning creation.</p>

   <p id="p0125" class="p">Our focus today is protecting the heritage, picturesque landscape 
    <italic class="italic">style</italic> rather than on maintaining specific, unsuitable taxa. That said, we can sometimes source variants of existing species more suited to our emerging climate but recollecting (from different populations in the wild) or horticultural selection. We have commissioned a more detailed analysis of the future climate vulnerability or resilience of our current species which, when used in combination with a ‘useful life expectancy’ tree assessment (
    <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Callow, 2011</xref>), will support planned removals and replacement of declining or unsuitable specimens. As an aside, and related to perceptions, it surprises many visitors to learn that over 50% of all trees in Melbourne Gardens are Australian-native, despite the ‘exotic feel’ of the landscape (largely because people forget that Australia has many subtropical and wet forest tree species suitable for horticulture). Fortunately, some of the more landscape significant species (e.g. 
    <italic class="italic">Araucaria</italic> and 
    <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> species) are not only Australian-native but also likely to be suited to the predicted climate in coming decades.

    <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pautasso et al., 2012</xref>). Due to the changing climatic baseline, it's not always easy to predict new incursions or whether the conditions will support their establishment. When this is combined with increased visitation and national importation of commodities, there is increased risk of a new pest inadvertently being introduced to damage our collections. Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria works work closely with government agencies charged with plant biosecurity to reduce these risks. For example, Melbourne Gardens with its high plant diversity and relative proximity to shipping docks and airports is currently used as an ‘early warning’ sentinel site by biosecurity officers through installing trapping systems to detect new pest incursions.

   <p id="p0145" class="p">With over 100 buildings (many of them of high heritage value) and an ageing infrastructure of utilities and paths, the built assets within Melbourne Gardens present a myriad of challenges in a changing climate. The design and condition of the stormwater system, for example, is poorly suited to deal with the increasing risk of extreme weather events such as high intensity rainfall causing overland flow and waterlogging. Works are already in progress to rectify some of these problems but even a more recent asset, like the automatic irrigation system installed in 1993–94, is in part nearing the end of its useful life. In large open plaza areas, we need to respond to anticipated higher temperatures through creative building and landscape design. In ‘cool zones’, like our Fern Gully, we can add new resting places to provide relief from extreme conditions.</p>
