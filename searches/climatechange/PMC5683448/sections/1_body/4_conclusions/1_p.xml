<p id="Par42" class="p">Our study demonstrated a significant increase in mortality during heat wave in Wuhan, China, while the mortality effects of heat waves varied greatly by different heat wave definitions. It was suggested to use daily mean temperature ≥ 33.3 °C (99th percentile) with duration ≥3 days as heat wave definition in Wuhan, as it could best capture the mortality effects of heat wave. Our results also showed that the elderly and females were more vulnerable to the mortality impact of heat waves. These findings suggest that region specific heat wave definitions are crucial and necessary for developing efficient local heat warning systems and providing evidence for policy makers to protect the vulnerable individuals.</p>
