<p id="Par25" class="p">According to a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>], we assessed the best model fit among the 45 various heat wave definitions by minimizing the sum of the Akaike Information Criterion for quasi-Poisson (Q-AIC) values from all group-specific mortality (total, male, female, age &lt; 65, and age ≥ 65). In addition, we compared the mortality risks of heat wave defined by Chinese Meteorological Administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] (HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub>, daily maximum temperature ≥35 °C and duration ≥ 3 days) with the most appropriate definition determined by the above criterion.
