<p id="Par27" class="p">Sensitivity analyses were performed by changing the df (5 to 8) for day of the year to control for seasonality and df (4 to 6) for relative humidity. Besides, we examined the possible confounding effects of air pollutants (i.e., PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) since short-term exposures to these pollutants were also found associated with daily mortality in numerous epidemiological studies. Additionally, we verified the model fits of different heat wave definitions by using another evaluation standard (Bayesian information criterion for quasi-Poisson, Q-BIC).
