<p id="Par26" class="p">To demonstrate the association between mortality and heat wave more comprehensively, we also conducted the lag effect analyses (lag0 to lag10) of heat waves, which separately assessed the mortality impact several days (0 to 10) posterior to heat waves. Mortality effects of heat waves at lag1 day, for instance, were assessed by linking heat wave exposure (i.e. heat-wave day or non-heat-wave day) 1Â day prior to deaths with the non-accidental deaths on the current day.</p>
