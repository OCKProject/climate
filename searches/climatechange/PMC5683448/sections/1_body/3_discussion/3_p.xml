<p id="Par38" class="p">A number of previous studies revealed that gender and age might modify the associations between environmental risk factors (such as air pollution, extremely temperature events) and daily mortality [

In the present study, we found that the elderly were more vulnerable to heat wave-related mortality, which might be due to the reduced thermoregulatory capacity, the status of on medication that may interfere with normal sweating process, low risk perception and adaptation ability to heat wave [

The impact of heat wave may become a great health and social burden in the next few decades in China due to the rapid population aging, which demonstrated the importance and urgency for decision makers and the public to design adaptation plan to heat wave for elderly people [
