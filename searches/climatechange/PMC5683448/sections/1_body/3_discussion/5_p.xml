<p id="Par40" class="p">Previously, a positive association between ambient pollutants and daily mortality has been clearly demonstrated in numerous epidemiological studies. In the present study, we observed that heat wave effects on mortality remained similar with and without adjusting for air pollutants (PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), even though the concentrations of air pollutants were well above the international health-based standards. Consistent results were also obtained in two recent Chinese studies, one of which was conducted in Nanjing using 18 different definitions of heat wave [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. These studies provided implications for the future researchers that air pollutants would not significantly change the estimated mortality risk of temperature, thus we can also approximately assess the temperature-related health effects without availability of air pollution data.
