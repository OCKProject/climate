<p id="Par41" class="p">Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the daily mortality data were obtained from only one district of Wuhan City, which may not completely capture the effects of heat wave in the whole city. Secondly, we did not consider the possible interactions between air pollution and high temperature in the analyses, which might result in overestimated heat wave effects if air pollution and high temperature had synergistic effects on mortality [

However, we only included daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature in the present study considering that these are most commonly used heat-related indicators, and can be easily understood by the public. In addition, the influence of ozone on mortality was not included in the analyses due to the unavailability of ozone data. However, the present and previous studies showed that heat-related mortality effects were robust after adjusting for air pollution [
