 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, the heat-related mortality in different regions varied greatly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] and 43 U.S. communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] showed that the morality risks of heat wave were spatially heterogeneous with greater effects in the northern regions and smaller in the southern regions. The differences revealed that population susceptibility to heat wave may be discrepant due to acclimatization to local climate characteristics through long-term physiological and behavioral adaptation [
