<p id="Par36" class="p">In this study, we evaluated which of the 46 heat wave definitions can best capture the heat wave impact on non-accidental mortality in Wuhan during 2003 to 2010. Compared with non-heat-wave days, heat waves defined by HW14 (daily mean temperature ≥ 99th percentile and duration ≥ 3 days) performed best in predicting the effects of heat wave on group-specific mortality. The estimated mortality effects of heat waves almost kept unchanged with and without adjusting for air pollutants (PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). We also found that females and the elderly were more susceptible to heat wave effects which were stronger and longer lasting. These findings may have important implications for public health policies to protect people from extremely hot temperatures in Wuhan, China.
