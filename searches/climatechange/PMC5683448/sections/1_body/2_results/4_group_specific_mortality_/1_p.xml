<p id="Par33" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the group-specific mortality effects of heat wave using definitions of HW14, HW29, HW43, and HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub>. The results of mortality risk using heat wave definitions of HW14, HW29, and HW43 were comparable, while heat wave defined by HW29 was not significantly associated with mortality for people younger than 65. However, when using official heat wave definition by Chinese Meteorological Administration, the estimated effects of heat wave on mortality became weakened when compared with those using definitions of HW14, HW29, and HW43. Relative risks of mortality using HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub> were 1.15 (95% 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic>: 1.08, 1.23) for the total population, 1.10 (95% 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic>: 1.01, 1.19) for males, 1.23 (95% 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic>: 1.12, 1.35) for females, 1.12 (95% 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic>: 1.00, 1.26) for people younger than 65, and 1.16 (95% 
 <italic class="italic">CI</italic>: 1.08, 1.26) for people of age ≥65. Generally, females and elderly people were more susceptible to the mortality risk of heat waves by using different heat wave definitions. Moreover, associations between heat waves and daily mortality almost kept unchanged with and without adjusting for air pollutants (PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>).
