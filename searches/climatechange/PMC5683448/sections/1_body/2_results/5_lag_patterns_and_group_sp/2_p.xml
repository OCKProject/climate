<p id="Par35" class="p">Our sensitivity analyses indicated that estimated mortality risks were robust when changing the df (5 to 8) for day of the year (Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S2). Associations between heat waves and daily mortality almost kept unchanged with and without adjusting for air pollutants (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Similar model fits were consistently observed by using Q-BIC as the evaluation standard, which also determined HW14 as the best predictive ability in assessing the mortality effects of heat wave (Additional file
