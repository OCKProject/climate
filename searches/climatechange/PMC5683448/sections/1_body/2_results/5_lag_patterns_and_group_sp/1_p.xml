 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> presents the lag patterns of heat wave effects on group-specific mortality using HW14 and HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub>. Generally, for total mortality, the highest mortality risk appeared on the first day (lag0) when heat waves occurred and the effect of heat waves persisted for several days’ duration (usually less than 10 days). Lag characteristics of mortality impact varied greatly by using different heat wave definitions, in spite of the similar tendency of gradual decay in the mortality risk. The heat wave effects were much stronger and longer lasting using definition of HW14 compared with HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub>. Additionally, the lag patterns of heat wave effects were modified by different genders and age groups. Females and the elderly (age ≥65) were more vulnerable to the mortality impact of heat waves using both HW14 and HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub> with higher mortality risks and longer lasting effects.
