 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1 shows that the number of heat-wave days and daily deaths during 2003â€“2010 in Wuhan under 45 different heat wave definitions. Similar number of heat-wave days and daily deaths were identified using daily maximum/minimum temperature metric and daily mean temperature metric in heat wave definitions. Less heat-wave days and more daily deaths on heat-wave days occurred when heat waves were defined by higher percentile of temperature thresholds and longer durations, while daily deaths on non-heat-wave days changed little along with heat wave definitions.
