 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> describes 46 definitions of heat waves defined by daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature, and calculates the sum of Q-AIC values from all group-specific mortality for different heat wave definitions. Heat waves (HW14, HW29, and HW43) defined by threshold of 99.0th percentile of temperature distribution with duration ≥ 3 days, ≥3 days, and ≥2 days gave the lowest Q-AIC value (27627.63, 27658.92, and 27641.87) when using daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature as the temperature indicator, respectively. And the model using HW
 <sub class="sub">CMA</sub> as heat wave definition produced the Q-AIC value of 27726.94. Moreover, HW14 defined by daily mean temperature ≥ 33.3 °C (99th percentile) with duration ≥ 3 days performed best in model fits among the 46 heat wave definitions.
