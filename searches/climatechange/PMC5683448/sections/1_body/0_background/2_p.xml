 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In general, heat waves are defined by (1) temperature indicator (e.g., daily average, maximum, or minimum temperature), (2) temperature threshold (e.g., a relative threshold or an absolute threshold), and (3) heat wave duration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Many previous studies applied several heat wave definitions as sensitivity analyses when assessing the health impact of heat wave [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, heat-related mortality risk estimates varied greatly by different heat wave definitions according to several recent studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], which demonstrated the importance of heat wave definitions in predicting health effects of heat waves. Moreover, by using the variance-decomposition method, heat wave definitions were found to attribute to 22.2% of the uncertainty for mortality risks during future heat waves in a recent study conducted in the Eastern United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Hence, it is of great significance to determine the most appropriate definition for heat wave warning systems based on local epidemiological studies.
