 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>], impact of heat wave on health has drawn more and more attention worldwide. For instance, California heat wave occurring in 2006 was reported to be associated with approximately 16,166 excess emergency department visits and 1182 excess hospitalizations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. And in the summer of 2010, Moscow and Western Russia suffered an unprecedented heat wave both in strength and duration, resulting in 55,000 excess heat-related deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. From a pathophysiological point of view, heat waves were associated with dehydration, increased blood viscosity and impairment of the endothelial function, which would in return increase the risk for thrombo-embolic diseases and cardiovascular events [
