The largest lost production in a given year was over 3 million Mg in Oklahoma, 6 million Mg in Kansas, and 4 million Mg in North Dakota during this period. This is a significant economic factor in each of these state economies. Since 1950, the production lost in these three states exceeds 65 million Mg in Oklahoma, 180 million Mg in Kansas, and 91 million Mg in North Dakota. These represent extremely large losses across the Great Plains and can be partially offset by management practices to increase climate resilience in our cropping systems. These management practices encompass how we manage the soil for water and nutrients, along with cultivar selection, and agronomic practices related to crop management for weeds, pests, and diseases.
