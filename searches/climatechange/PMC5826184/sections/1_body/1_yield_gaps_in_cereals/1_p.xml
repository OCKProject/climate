<p class="p">Throughout the history of agriculture, there has been the development of indices that describe how crops respond to the weather or how climate affects the distribution of crops around the world. Temperature and precipitation have been the two primary variables used in the development of these indices because of the availability of these data from public sources; however, the relationship of these indices to yield gaps has not been conducted. A recent study by 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holzkämper et al. (2013)</xref> incorporated six factors into a crop suitability index that included average daily minimum temperatures below 0°C for frost impacts, daily mean temperature to determine plant growth, average daily maximum temperature above 35°C for heat stress, average daily soil water availability (precipitation–reference evapotranspiration), and length of the phenological period (days) to account for the effects of changing phenological development on biomass accumulation and crop yield. They were able to relate their index to maize yields for a number of locations around the world with a positive relationship between productivity and the suitability index. This approach is a refinement of the original approach by
