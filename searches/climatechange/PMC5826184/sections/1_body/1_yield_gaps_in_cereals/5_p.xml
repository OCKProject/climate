<p class="p">The primary inability to close the yield gap in the Great Plains was the lack of soil water to meet the water requirements of the wheat crop and insufficient precipitation amounts to recharge the soil profile during the grain-filling period. 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Egli and Hatfield (2014a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>) demonstrated that maize and soybean productivity were directly related to the ability of the soil to supply water during the grain-filling period. The dynamics of this response has been described by 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hatfield (2012)</xref> to show the largest effect on maize yields in the central United States was the lack of sufficient water availability during the grain-filling period to meet the evaporative demand. The increase in precipitation variability with climate change will increase variation in crop yield (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hatfield et al., 2011</xref>). Soil water becomes the dominant factor affecting vegetative productivity in both cultivated and natural systems and the ability of the soil to infiltrate and store precipitation will become a critical factor to offset the impact of increasing variability in the changing precipitation regime. Increases in soil organic matter and the resultant impact on soil water holding capacity will increase the ability of a soil to store water and increase the infiltration rate. Both of these factors will increase the efficiency of a soil to offset variation in precipitation due to climate change.
