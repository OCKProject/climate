<p class="p">To evaluate this framework, we computed the yield gaps for wheat production in Kansas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota following the approach of 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Egli and Hatfield (2014a)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hatfield et al. (2017)</xref> using state level yield data since 1950. We selected 1950 as the beginning point in these analyses because this represents the agricultural era with modern technology. Yield gaps are computed as the difference between attainable yield, defined as the highest yields observed over the period of record, and the actual yield. Attainable yields are assumed to represent wheat yields under conditions that are non-limiting during the production year and a regression line is fit through these yields to obtain an attainable yield for each year. In this case study we used statewide yields rather than county yields to show the impact of climate variables at a large scale. It is evident for these three states that the attainable yield varies among states. For example, in Oklahoma, state level yields have shown only a modest increase since 1980 while Kansas and North Dakota have shown significant increases in grain production (

 </bold>). Yield gaps for all three states showed variation from 1950 to 2016 and a statistical analysis of the yield gap with monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation observations was conducted. Regression analysis of monthly statewide average maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation (data obtained from the Regional Climate Center) for the months of October, November, April, May, and June for Oklahoma and Kansas and April, May, June, and July for North Dakota against yield gaps for these three states revealed that precipitation was the only consistent and significant factor explaining yield gaps. For Oklahoma, the yield gap was explained by total April and May precipitation with a

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.7 and in Kansas the yield gap was due to May precipitation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.78). In North Dakota, with the later maturing crop, June and July precipitation was the dominant factor explaining 0.65 of the yield gap. Temperature for these three states showed no significant relationship to the variation in yield gap, even though there were years with temperatures that deviated from normal, these deviations were not sufficient to cause a change in statewide yields. Precipitation amounts below normal increased the yield gap and while low precipitation events are often associated with high temperatures, the phenology of the wheat crop with the grain-filling period earlier in the year reduces the potential for high temperature events. Although there were years in which the temperatures were above normal, these were not above the maximum temperature range for wheat for a significant period of time to become a significant factor reducing yield. Evaluating the effect of increasing temperatures has to account for the temperature increase relative to the temperature ranges of the crop. For example, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ahmed et al. (2017)</xref> showed an increase in wheat yields in the Pacific Northwest; however, these temperature increases are still within temperature ranges for the crop. We evaluated temperature effects using different temperature parameters for these data and found no consistent and significant relationships. This could be related to the fact that high temperature events or frost occur over short time periods, e.g., less than 5 days, and in more localized areas that are not detectable in monthly average data at the statewide scale, but can have significant impacts on local productivity (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prasad and Djanaguiraman, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rezaei et al., 2015</xref>). This does raise a caution about the scale being used in analysis of climate impacts on agriculture.
