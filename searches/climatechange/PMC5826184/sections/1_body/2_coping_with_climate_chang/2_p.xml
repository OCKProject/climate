<p class="p">There is evidence in the literature to suggest that increasing temperatures will become more significant in affecting wheat productivity; however, some of this impact can be offset by ensuring these crops have an adequate soil water supply. Although, precipitation was a dominant factor in historical yields for these states, the recent results by

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kaur et al. (2017)</xref> suggest that we need to devote more attention to the effects of temperature on wheat productivity and suggest analyses and simulation models be utilized to evaluate the potential growing regions and productivity for wheat under future climate scenarios. To ensure continual advances in wheat productivity will require an integrated approach combining genetic improvement along with management practices and the approach we have outlined in the paper provides a framework for evaluating how we are progressing toward reducing the gap between genetic potential and actual yield.
