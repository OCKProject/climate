<p class="p">Yield gap analysis was applied to the Great Plains of the United States using Kansas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota statewide yield data as examples of the changes in wheat productivity. These states were selected because Kansas and Oklahoma wheat yields at the state-wide production have shown a decline since 2000 with a recovery in yields in 2016 to near record levels (
