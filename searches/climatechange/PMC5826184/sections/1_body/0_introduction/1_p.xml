<p class="p">Agricultural ecosystems convert light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into a variety of diverse plant products, e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, starch, etc. However, the changing climate, affects water availability, temperature, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations which in turn directly influences the plant growth processes and ultimately the ability of plants to efficiently produce the protein, starch, and other plant products that the human race requires as food. These effects are especially critical in cereal crops because of the importance in the human food supply. It is important to understand the role climate has on crop productivity and on individual plants and plant communities as part of agroecosystems.
