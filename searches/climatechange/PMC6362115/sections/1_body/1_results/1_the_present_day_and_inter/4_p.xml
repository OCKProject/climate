<p id="Par11" class="p">Ocean ecosystems, and therefore ocean colour, are not static, changing with the seasons and interannually (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>) in general captures the patterns of the satellite estimated variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>), though overestimates the interannual variability in higher latitudes, where it also overestimates the mean (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The model Equatorial Pacific has a narrower band of variability around the equator than seen in the observations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), a discrepancy that shows up in both Chl-a and

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The model’s slightly lower value relative to the observed median magnitude of this ratio in Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) is expected as the model does not capture all the sources of variability (e.g. mesoscale features) found in the real ocean. The current day relative magnitude of interannual variability of the other optically important constituents (CDOM, detrital particles) are predicted by the model to have similar values to Chl-a. However, the relative magnitude of the observed interannual variability of

 <sub class="sub">RS</sub> is lower (red symbols in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) than these other variables. The model captures these lower ratios (though underestimates the variability, as in Chl-a) over most of the spectrum, but not at the high wavelength bands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). However, we note that the uncertainty in
