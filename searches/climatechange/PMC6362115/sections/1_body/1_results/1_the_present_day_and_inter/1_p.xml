 </sup>). Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) has high values in subpolar regions and along the equator where upwelling water supplies nutrients to fuel the marine ecosystem as is found in the real ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). These regions are dominated by larger phytoplankton cells (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>) such as diatoms. Chl-a is much lower in the subtropical gyres; here nutrient supplies are low and pico-phytoplankton, with their high nutrient affinity, dominate.
