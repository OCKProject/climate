Community structure changes impact the water optics since phytoplankton types absorb and scatter light differently to one another

 </sup>), our study suggests that changes in phytoplankton community structure will have a stronger climate-change-driven signal over the course of the coming century than Chl-a. Sustaining time series measurements that include information on taxonomic or functional group biomass is therefore highly desirable, as is the continued improvement in our ability to detect phytoplankton diversity from space
