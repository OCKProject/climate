<p id="Par43" class="p">The marine biogeochemical component resolves the cycling of carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, silica, iron, and oxygen through inorganic, living, dissolved and particulate organic phases. The ecosystem component resolves 8 phytoplankton types (diatoms, coccolithophores, pico-eukaryotes, 
 <italic class="italic">Synechococcus</italic>, high and low light 
 <italic class="italic">Prochlorococcus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Trichodesmium</italic> and unicellular diazotrophs) and two grazers. The phytoplankton types differ in the nutrients they require (e.g. diatoms require silica), maximum growth rate, nutrient half saturation constants, sinking rates, and palatability to grazers. The phytoplankton also differ in their spectral absorption and scattering characteristics (see Fig. 1 in ref.
