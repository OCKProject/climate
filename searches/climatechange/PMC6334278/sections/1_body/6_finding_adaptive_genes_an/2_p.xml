<p class="p">Currently, there are two general methods to identify genes and mechanisms related to important agronomic traits in plant species, known as “top‐down” and “bottom‐up.” The top‐down approach begins with a phenotype of interest followed by forward genetic analysis to identify candidate genes. Contrastingly, bottom‐up approaches use population genetic analyses to identify signatures of adaptation in a set of potentially adaptive genes, and then apply bioinformatics and reverse genetic tools to associate selected genes to a phenotype (Ross‐Ibarra, Morrell, &amp; Gaut,
