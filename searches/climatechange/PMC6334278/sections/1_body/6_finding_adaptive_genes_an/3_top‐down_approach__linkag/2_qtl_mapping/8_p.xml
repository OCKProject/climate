<p class="p">An interesting study providing both opportunities and limitations of QTL is by Książkiewicz et al. (

 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) found multiple QTLs responsible for vernalisation responsiveness, yet the specific genes in these QTLs remain unknown. In addition, although overlapping QTLs were found in Australian and Polish experiments, identification of an additional small effect QTL in an Australian trial is a reflection that QTL results are environmental dependant, and hence, to capture the whole picture for a trait of interest, it is necessary to integrate and compare QTL data from different experiments.
