<p class="p">Although the identification of QTLs and candidate genes is relatively routine when a suitable population is available with good quality genotypic and phenotypic information, the translation of this information to the development of improved varieties can be challenging, and this method does have several limitations. For instance, developing mapping populations is difficult for some plants, such as those propagated vegetatively, perennial and polyploid species. In tetraploid alfalfa, which is a perennial species, availability of limited number of markers in a polyploid genome restricts the saturation of linkage maps. Furthermore, fewer recombination events are captured in a tetraploid population compared with the diploid, which affects the precision of linkage maps (Li &amp; Brummer,

Furthermore, QTL results are dependent on environment/experimental design and the allelic variations in parents of the experimental population (two parents in most studies). For example, identification of QTLs in regions with lower recombination rate, such as centromeric regions, will be more challenging. Additional drawbacks of QTL arise from what is known as the Beavis effect that is overestimation of phenotypic variances associated with QTL in a population of small size (Beavis,
