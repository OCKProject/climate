<p class="p">Drought is a major limitation in the production of many legumes and has been targeted in various QTL studies to search for loci and genes conferring tolerance that has led to the breeding of crops with greater drought tolerance. A recent successful example is a study by Varshney et al. (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) in chickpea, where they found several main effect and epistatic QTLs, among which, one QTL cluster was suggested as a “QTL‐hotspot,” a candidate genomic region for several drought tolerance and root traits in chickpea (Jaganathan et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Kale et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Later, applying a marker‐assisted backcrossing approach, this QTL‐hotspot was introgressed into a popular Indian chickpea variety (JG 11), which improved several root traits including rooting depth, root length density, and root dry weight (Varshney et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This work was extended to several elite varieties in India and Africa (Thudi, Gaur, et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Applying a QTL‐seq approach, that is, the identification of QTLs by whole genome resequencing from two bulked populations (Takagi et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), candidate genes for several traits under rainfed conditions (100‐seed weight, root/total plant dry weight) were rapidly identified in chickpea, and three genes have since been validated (Singh, Khan, Jaganathan, et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
