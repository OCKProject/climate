<p class="p">Two popular genetic analyses used in the top‚Äêdown method are QTL and association or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping. QTL mapping is the more traditional approach and has been successful in identifying genomic regions associated with adaptive traits. For example, soil salinity is one of the major limitations for successful germination and plant growth in soybean (Essa,
