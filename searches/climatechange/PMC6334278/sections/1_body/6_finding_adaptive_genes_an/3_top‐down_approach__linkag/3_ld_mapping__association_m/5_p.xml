<p class="p">Despite the potential that LD mapping offers to identify adaptive genes, the tendency for spurious association, that is, false association with genomic regions, missing genotypes, identification of small effect variants, and genetic heterogeneity remain as limitations (Korte &amp; Farlow, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Another limiting factor of LD mapping is that resolution is dependent on the rate of LD decay, so using wild relatives of crops could serve as a better foundation.
