<p class="p">In cowpea, salinity has become an increasing threat to production, and Ravelombola et al. (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) identified SNPs associated with salt tolerance at germination and seedling stages. These markers can be applied as a tool for selecting tolerant lines to be included in breeding programs of this crop. One of the most successful applications of GWAS is in peanut. Peanut is one of the important crop of the semi‐arid tropics, where climate change is posing a threat to crop productivity due to the increase in range of abiotic (e.g., drought and heat) and biotic stresses. Although the complex and tetraploid nature of the peanut genome makes QTL mapping studies a challenging task, GWAS enhances the chance of characterizing candidate genes for production related traits. A comprehensive study by Pandey et al. (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) analysed marker‐trait associations for a wide range of economically important traits in peanut, such as yield components, oil components, drought, and disease tolerance. Several markers with significant allelic effects (&gt;20% phenotypic variation) were identified for different traits such as pod yield, seed weight (under well‐watered and drought stress), oil content, and quality. Another GWAS study in 158 peanut accessions found a total of 51 SNPs associated with various traits including seed weight and pod weight, and identified candidate genes related to the domestication of peanut (Zhang et al.,
