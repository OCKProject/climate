<p class="p">In our opinion, because GWAS requires extensive phenotypic and genotypic information, it might be more usefully applied for major legume crops, where resources might already be available and the development of the future resources might be of interest of a wider research community. Additionally, accessing and integrating GWAS results from various studies is currently a cumbersome task due to the lack of a dedicated GWAS database in legumes that would enable cross referencing of resources from different experiments. The development of such a database would greatly benefit legume adaptation research.</p>
