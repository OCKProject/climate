<p class="p">In legumes, genome‐environment association analyses have been applied in

  <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Medicago truncatula</styled-content>
 </styled-content>, which identified candidate genes associated with adaptation to annual mean temperature and precipitation in the wettest month, and isothermality (Yoder et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0165" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). A recent study in narrow‐leafed lupin investigated the association between SNPs and climatic gradients and found significant associations between some SNPs with annual mean temperature and precipitation (Mousavi‐Derazmahalleh et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Although availability of genotyping by sequencing data along with georeferenced genetic material makes genome‐environment association mapping an interesting avenue to explore, such analyses are most useful based on collections made directly from the wild habitat, ensuring good correspondence between climatic records and collection site. Hence, they may be less informative for legumes that have been domesticated a long time ago and diverged substantially from their wild ancestors. For example, in chickpea, which is one of the oldest domesticated legumes, hybrids from crosses between domesticated chickpea with 
 <italic class="italic">Cicer echinospermum</italic>, a wild relative that is believed to have contributed gene flow to cultivated chickpea, are infertile (Ladizinsky &amp; Adler,
