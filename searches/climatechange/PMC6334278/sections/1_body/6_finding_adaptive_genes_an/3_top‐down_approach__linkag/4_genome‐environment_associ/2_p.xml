<p class="p">GWAS has been applied in genome‐environment association mapping to provide a new avenue to identify climate‐adaptive genetic loci and the genetic basis of local adaptation (Hancock et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), assuming “association between conditionally adaptive mutations and the environmental conditions with which they interact” (Turner, Bourne, Von Wettberg, Hu, &amp; Nuzhdin, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref> p. 262). Hence, genome‐environment associations along with genome‐phenotype associations can be applied to efficiently select for climate resilience traits (Lasky et al.,
