<p class="p">Population genomics has great potential for identifying candidate genes harbouring adaptive mutations. However, careful consideration must be taken to exclude demographic effects such as population size and structure, which could bias the results by increasing the statistical variance applied to detect the selection signature. In addition, methods that consider demography may still not be able to detect recent selective sweeps (Nielsen, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). An example of where this can be seen is in narrow‐leafed lupin, a domesticated crop of the 21st century. We have recently assessed narrow‐leafed for signatures of selective sweeps at several domestication loci, including flowering time, pod‐dehiscence, alkaloid, and so forth, which were expected to show a signature of selection. However, the expected signal was only found at the flowering time locus,

Additionally, the lack of selection evidence near other domestication genes could be illuminated by the strong population bottleneck during recent domestication of narrow‐leafed lupin (Berger et al.,
