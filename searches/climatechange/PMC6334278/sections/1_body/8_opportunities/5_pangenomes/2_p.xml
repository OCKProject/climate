<p class="p">Although the availability of reference genomes has greatly assisted plant genetics research and breeding, these reference genomes capture only a portion of diversity present in the species. A solution is the development of pangenome assemblies that more comprehensively capture sequence and structural diversity in a species. In legumes, pangenomes have been constructed for soybean (Lam et al.,

A pangenome of soybean based on seven accessions of wild soybean suggested faster evolution and greater variability in dispensable genes compared with the core genes, which may be associated with adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses (Li et al.,
