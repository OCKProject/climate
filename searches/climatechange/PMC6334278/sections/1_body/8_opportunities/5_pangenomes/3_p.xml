<p class="p">Pangenome construction takes into the account the structural variations, and so they capture the genetic variation of the species more comprehensively rather than a single reference genome. They also enable comprehensive identification of SNP variation. This simplifies discovery of rare variants, which might be associated with QTLs for agronomic traits. Pangenomes also allow the differentiation between SNPs occurring in core (present in all individuals of the species) and variable (present in a subset of individuals) genomes, the latter of which was found in several studies to influence adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses (Hurgobin &amp; Edwards,

These resources can be of value for legume breeding, based on novel gene identification and discovery of nucleotide diversity that enables molecular marker design for introgression of previously untapped genes into crop improvement programs.
