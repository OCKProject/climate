<p class="p">Considering the fact that the selection of appropriate individuals with enough variation is an important element to a successful pangenome study, we suggest that pangenomes may be smaller in size in crops such as narrow‐leafed lupin, which went through severe genetic bottleneck during its recent domestication (Berger et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In addition, pangenome construction requires extensive sequence data and computational resources, and its quality is dependent on the assembly precision. This makes the development of pangenomes challenging in the case of crops with complex and large repetitive genomes such as pea (Macas, Neumann, &amp; Navrátilová,
