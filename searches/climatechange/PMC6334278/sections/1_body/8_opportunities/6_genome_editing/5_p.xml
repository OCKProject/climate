<p class="p">Although CRISPR offers an unprecedented opportunity for crop improvement, the starting point of a CRISPR approach is the comprehensive knowledge of the target gene(s), its function and regulation. This may restrict the use of CRISPR in crops that have limited information of genes involved in adaptation processes. Nevertheless, the decreasing cost of genome sequencing accompanied by the increase in precision of genome assemblies and functional annotation could improve gene prediction, though it should be emphasized that experimental characterization of genes of interest remains necessary for successful results.
