<p class="p">A relatively new technology for mutagenesis is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐Cas9 system. Originally discovered as bacteria's adaptive immune system, CRISPRs' repeat‐spacer‐repeat sequence pattern was found to be involved in an RNA intereference‐like mechanism that can identify and cut foreign DNA. Genome editing modification by CRISPR uses a guide RNA that is complementary to a target gene, induces double‐strand breaks usually by a Cas9 nuclease, followed by a non‐homologous end joining or homology‐directed repair mechanism (Jinek et al.,
