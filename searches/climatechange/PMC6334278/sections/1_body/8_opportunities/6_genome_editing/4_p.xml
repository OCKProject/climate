<p class="p">CRISPR has become a popular choice for genome editing in plants due to ease of use, lower cost, and ability to edit multiple targets that enables genes pyramiding into a new cultivar within a single generation. Furthermore, unlike traditional breeding methods, CRISPR is not restrained by the existing diversity as it can directly introduce new mutations. This would be beneficial, especially for crops that have low variation for traits of interest and where natural variations cannot be find in nature. In addition, although crossing or backcrossing methods may result in introduction of deleterious alleles, genome editing is unlikely to cause this issue.</p>
