<p class="p">Recent decades witnessed a tremendous progress in DNA sequencing technologies; however, successful crop improvement plans are also dependant on accurately measuring plant traits to identify genetic loci associated with traits. Along with innovative and high throughout phenotyping strategies (such as near‐infrared spectroscopy on agricultural harvesters and spectral reflectance of plant canopy), analysis can be extended to the molecular phenotype using transcriptomic, metabolomics, and proteomic approaches (Beleggia et al.,

 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Together, these will improve our capacity to explore the phenotypic space from large multilocation field trials (Fahlgren, Gehan, &amp; Baxter,

A recent study on a large population of rice (consists of 1,568 samples), using both field‐based high throughput phenotyping (HTP) and manual phenotyping, confirmed the efficiency and accuracy of HTP in detecting QTLs associated with grain yield and yield components (Tanger et al.,

 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and integrating HTP methods with high‐throughput genotyping hold a potential to unravel the genetic basis of complex traits, such as heat and drought tolerance.
