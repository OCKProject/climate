<p class="p">In order to fully understand adaptive evolution, we should understand all possible changes leading to the adaptation. Therefore, whilst focusing on the role of genomics for producing climate‐ready crops, it is worthwhile to take into consideration the phenotypic alterations as a result of epigenetics variation. Epigenetics refers to mechanisms such as modification of DNA methylation and histones, and noncoding RNAs, which do not alter DNA sequences but could affect gene expression and trait phenotypes (Springer &amp; Schmitz,

  <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">Arabidopsis thaliana</styled-content>
 </styled-content> has shown substantial heritable DNA methylation variation for several plant traits and plasticity, such as root allocation and drought tolerance, as well as the act of natural selection on some of the variation, such as plant biomass and height (Y.Y. Zhang, Fischer, Colot, &amp; Bossdorf, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0172" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). A recent study by Song, Zhang, Stelly, and Chen (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) revealed the contribution of methylated genes in the domestication of cotton, through induction of photoperiodic flowering due to the over expression of a photoperiodic regulating gene (

Although these studies provide excellent examples of the potential of epigenetics for identification of new sources of variation that can be applied in crop improvement, it is clear that genomics and epigenomics are not commonly integrated. Addressing this gap and combining forces between fields could lead to significant advances in breeding climate‐change ready crops, including legumes.
