<p class="p">After the cereals, legumes are the most agriculturally important crop family (Graham &amp; Vance, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) as they have multiple uses, ranging from animal forage and aquaculture feed to human food. Legume grains are appreciated for their protein content, in particular among low‐income families or where people avoid eating meat for religious or ethical reasons (Young, Mudge, &amp; Ellis, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0167" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Zhu, Choi, Cook, &amp; Shoemaker, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0175" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Legumes contain substances beneficial to health such as folate, lignans, saponins, antioxidants, dietary fibre, and resistant starch, and have the potential to offer protection against some cancers (American Institute for Cancer Research, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), diabetes, and obesity (Dove et al., 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Due to their symbiotic nitrogen‐fixing characteristics, legumes have a crucial role in natural ecosystems as well as in sustainable farming through their contribution in crop rotations and increasing soil fertility in arid areas and where nitrogen is low (Zahran,
