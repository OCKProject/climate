<p class="p">Broadening the genetic base of crops through induced mutations has become a common practice for generating genetic variability for use in crop improvement programs (Sikora, Chawade, Larsson, Olsson, &amp; Olsson, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Both radiation (including X and gamma rays) and chemical‐based mutations (such as ethyl methane sulphonate and methyl nitrosourea) have been widely applied in legumes. More than 442 mutant varieties of legumes have been released officially or commercially worldwide according to the FAO/IAEA Mutant Variety Database (IAEA/FAO,

 <xref rid="pce13203-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A wide variety of improved attributes have been associated with these mutants, including higher yield, resistance to virus and fungal diseases, early maturity, and tolerance to drought (IAEA/FAO, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Mutagenesis breeding has introduced new genetic variation for breeding programs and has had a major impact on novel traits. For a comprehensive review on plant mutagenesis methods, please see Sikora et al. (
