<p class="p">Although climate change is a global threat, its direction and severity is not spread equally across continents and even regions. For example, although Mediterranean countries in Europe will experience frequent droughts, northern Europe is expected to become more of a Mediterranean climate. In Asia, more floods are expected in countries such as Bangladesh, due to the increase in severity of monsoon rains, whereas some others may experience decline in precipitation. In Africa, rise in temperature is predicted to increase desertification (Hopkin,

 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and hence their agriculture and food security will be also negatively affected, such as in Sub‐Saharan Africa as reviewed by Kotir (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Although the fragile nature of these regions makes them of great priority for maintaining agricultural productivity, to develop effective plans and make the best use of funding, ecosystem integrity needs to be taken into the account as well. In this context, Hannah et al. (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) introduced several regional and global adaptation priorities by modelling the changes in agricultural suitability of 15 major rainfed staple crops, as well as biodiversity changes of 1,263 bird species. However, concerning crop development and breeding, we suggest that identifying climate‐related changes in biodiversity of crop wild relatives (CWR) along with farming suitability provides a more holistic approach to develop priority schemes.
