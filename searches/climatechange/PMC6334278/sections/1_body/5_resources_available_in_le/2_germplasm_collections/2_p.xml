<p class="p">Germplasm collections are the cornerstone of genetic resource conservation and management. Preserving wild plant populations in their natural habitat 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> will not only conserve diversity, but also ensures the extension of evolutionary processes that could lead to adaptive traits and new genetic and genotypic diversity for a wide range of species (Hawkes, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; National Research Council, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). The importance of 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> conservation of wild populations in particular for preservation of threatened Mediterranean legume genus such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lupinus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cicer</italic>, due to the loss of natural habitats, ecosystems, and genetic diversity have been discussed and demonstrated (Maxted &amp; Bennett, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Walter &amp; Gillett, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0156" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). However, there are currently few case studies of 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> conservation in legumes for wild species (Ajlouni, El‐Oqlah, Al‐Ghzawi, Al‐Tawaha, &amp; Amri, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, it is also important to consider the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>/on farm conservation of landraces and heterogeneous populations as a crucial aspect of the conservation of crop germplasm (Brush, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>).
