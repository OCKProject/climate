<p class="p">Legumes hold great promise to mitigate the effect of climate change through their contribution in sustainable farming, capitalization of elevated level of CO2, and broadening the crop base, which is currently dominated by a small number of major crops, mainly from the cereal family. In addition, enormous progress has been made in legumes to identify novel alleles for adaptive traits. However, deployment of these findings in applied breeding remain a major limitation to release climate‐ready cultivars. As stated by Gready (
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), disruptive thinking and technologies are required to take advantage of best of the old and the new. We believe availability of genome editing tools such as CRISPR provide an excellent example of this. The full potential of legume crops remains yet to be explored, with genomics as a powerful enabling tool. Choice of approaches to create new cultivars is dependent on various factors such as plant information, availability of genomic, and phenotypic resources, nature of traits (simple or polygenic) and countries' regulations. Traditional and modern breeding approaches contributed (and will contribute) in creating improved crop varieties. However, the urgency for crop improvement, driven by fast pace of climate change and rapid population growth, emphasize the need for thinking outside the box. CRISPRs allow to create novel cultivars with multiple genes only in one generation. This substantially speed up the process of creating crops adapted to the ever‐changing environment and ensures that agriculture can keep up with the velocity of climate change.
