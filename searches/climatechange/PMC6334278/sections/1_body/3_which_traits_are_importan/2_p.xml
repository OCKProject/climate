<p class="p">Yield is often the primary target of breeding, however, domestication traits such as flowering time, alkaloid content, and pod indehiscence have been the long‚Äêterm targets of breeding experiments as they contribute to yield total and quality. The multifaceted significance of flowering time in ecological, evolutionary, and adaptation processes makes it unique among traits that affect plant fitness (Elzinga et al.,

 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A global search on 116 Northern Hemisphere plant families, including several species of legume, found global phylogenetic signals in the direction and magnitude of flowering time shifts, led by selection under climate change (Rafferty &amp; Nabity, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, explaining the variation among or within species, and whether these shifts are sufficient for survival, remains unclear (Visser &amp; Both, 
 <xref rid="pce13203-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Thus, unravelling the genetic basis of flowering time variation is of great importance for breeding purposes (Nelson, Berger, &amp; Erskine,
