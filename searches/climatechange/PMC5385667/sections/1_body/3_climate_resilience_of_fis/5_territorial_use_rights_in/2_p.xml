<p class="p">TURF fisheries that are managed through incentive-based participation and effective enforcement may be better able to withstand climate impacts (Hilborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2003</xref>), and thus be more durable against environmental change. For example in Chile, TURFs resulted in increased abundance and size of managed and unmanaged species in comparison with open access areas (Gelcich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2012</xref>; ECR-1). A survey of species and habitats inside and outside of several TURFs in Chile showed that reef fish species had significantly higher species richness, biomass, and density in TURFs compared with open access areas (ECR-2), even though these are not the managed species under property rights regimes (Gelcich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2012</xref>). In Galicia, Spain the TURF system includes advisors working with fisher cooperatives, who facilitate and support decision-making processes and play a key role in communication between fishers, scientists, and policy makers (Macho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2013</xref>). These strategies can in many cases allow for adaptive (SCR-1) and community-based management (SCR-6) (Hilborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2005</xref>; Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>). Having spatial property rights may also create incentives for avoiding other anthropogenic pressures that lead toÂ habitat destruction (ECR-3). In TURFs, fishers tend to more actively monitor their territories (Gelcich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2008</xref>), protecting against sources of habitat destruction and pollution. Additionally, spatial property rights provide incentives for fishers to combat poaching, even giving fishers direct authority over surveillance. For example, in the Spanish Asturias TURF system for goose barnacle, members actively engage in surveillance to prevent illegal harvest (Rivera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2014</xref>).
