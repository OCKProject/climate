<p class="p">Since TURFs give exclusive control over the target species in a given area, they create incentives for broader ecosystem-wide stewardship (Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>), thus reducing fishing mortality and contributing to the ecological resilience of the fish populations (ECR-1) (Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, social resilience is increased by maintaining the stock at desirable levels for a longer-term provision of services (SCR-3) (Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>). Ownership of an area can also allow TURF owners to generate revenues through other compatible activities such as tourism, recreation, and aquacultureâ€”thus diversifying local livelihoods and enhancing social resilience (SCR-2). For example, research has shown that TURFs in Chile have led to a high level of diversified income sources for the fishers involved (Moreno and Revenga
