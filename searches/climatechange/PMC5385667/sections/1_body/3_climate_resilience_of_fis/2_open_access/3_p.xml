<p class="p">Large open access systems may also experience complex stakeholder and institutional networks (Fidelman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2013</xref>). For example in the Peruvian anchoveta, formal institutions are slow in responding to climate changes (Badjeck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2009</xref>), constraining effective multi-level governance (SCR-4), and making community-based management (SCR-6) more difficult (Badjeck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2009</xref>). In fact, management involvement of stakeholders who do not have a long-term interest in the fishery may even have negative effects on sustainability (Botsford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1997</xref>), as they may lack stewardship incentives (SCR-3) (Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2008</xref>). In theory for open access, fishers respond to profitability, entering a fishery depending on the expected economic returns at a given time. In this context, fishers enter and exit the fishery more freely, which may help them buffer against stock fluctuations or declining stocks by having developed alternative sources of income (livelihood diversification (SCR-2)) (Allison and Ellis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2001</xref>). However, this flexibility may be limited by the high capital investments in many open access systems that make it more difficult to exit the fishery, and for the poorest fishers, who may remain in the fishery despite severely declining stocks (e.g., Cinner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009a</xref>). Fisher mobility can be high in open access systems, and fishers may be accustomed to shifting from one area to another in the search for productive stocks (SCR-5) (Sumaila et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2011</xref>). On the ecological side, however, fisher mobility is related to a decrease in ecological resilience due to the serial depletion of stocks and to a lower capacity to monitor and determine population dynamics, making adaptive management more difficult (SCR-1) (DeYoung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2008</xref>; Leith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2014</xref>).
