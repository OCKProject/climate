<p class="p">In open access fisheries, harvest decisions are often made with limited consideration of ecological information or economic costs and benefits to society (Costanza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1998</xref>), and there is often low compliance with regulations due to the lack of well-defined access rights and enforcement (Sumaila 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2012</xref>). An open access system lacks allocation of property rights, which have been demonstrated to create incentives for conserving biodiversity and habitats. Thus, in the absence of rights, open access does not promote the conservation of habitats and ecosystems (ECR-2), nor sustainable management (ERC-1), and intensive and sometimes destructive fishing prevails over sustainable use of the resource (Grafton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2006</xref>). Well-known fisheries collapses have occurred in open access systems, like the Canadian Atlantic cod (McCay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2011</xref>), in part because adaptive management (SCR-1) is discouraged by the regulatory regime.
