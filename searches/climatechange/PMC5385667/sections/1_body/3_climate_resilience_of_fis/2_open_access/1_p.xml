<p class="p">Open access fisheries do not have well-defined access rights; access rights either are completely absent or are not enforced (Sumaila 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2012</xref>). Under open access, the fish stock is rival but non-excludable, meaning that the right to fish is accorded to anyone, sometimes with a license or a nominal fee accessible to anyone. Individuals have incentives to maximize their profits, even at the expense of capturing as many fish as possible in a short time (Hardin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">1968</xref>; Costanza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1998</xref>), which can lead to unsustainable harvest levels and destructive fishing practices that will eventually erode the economic value of the fishery as well (Worm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2009</xref>). Additionally, unlimited access can create a competitive ‘race to fish’ to catch fish before others do, which further exacerbates overfishing and incentivizes over-capitalization, redundant effort, and inefficient timing of harvest, again lowering the profitability of the fishery (Pauly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2002</xref>; Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>). Many fisheries around the world are managed as open access; however, open access systems have a poor record of performance in terms of sustainability (Gordon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1954</xref>; Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>) and are a primary contributor to the stock collapse of many of the world’s fisheries (Pauly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2002</xref>). In addition, for overexploited fisheries, reducing fishing pressure is the principal means of reducing the impacts of climate change (Brander 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2007</xref>), and this may be difficult to achieve under open access regimes.
