<p class="p">Unlike open access, limited entry systems could be implemented more effectively from a community-based basis (SCR-6), as shown by hake and pollock cooperatives in the United States (Hilborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, community-based management within a limited entry setting may not be sufficient for achieving sustainable use of the resource, as in the case of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery (Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>), where the fishery was incapable of implementing adaptive management (SCR-1). In contrast, limited access regulations can be relatively easily adjustedâ€”including changing the number or cost of licenses, or altering area and gear restrictions based on seasonal projections (Wilen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">1988</xref>; Townsend 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">1990</xref>). This flexibility can potentially be beneficial for adaptive management (SCR-1), and for allowing fishing in new areas (SCR-5) when stocks shift their distributions (Cheung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2012</xref>).
