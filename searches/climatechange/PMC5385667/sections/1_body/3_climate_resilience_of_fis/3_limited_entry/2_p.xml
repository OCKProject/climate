<p class="p">Despite the different possible restrictions on access, fisheries can underperform or fail in economic and biological terms due to excessive capital investment (Hilborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2005</xref>), redundant effort, inefficient timing of harvest, or other inefficiencies that are also common to the open access regime (Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>). Indeed, failure to control effort can still lead a limited entry fishery to near open access overcapacity and effort conditions, with the subsequent negative implications for recovery under climate change (Brander 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2007</xref>). This overcapacity provides no incentives to fishers to engage in sustainable management (Hilborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2005</xref>; Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>).
