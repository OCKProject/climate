<p class="p">Multi-level governance can be possible, although ITQ systems are usually designed as top-down management institutions (SCR-4). An exception is the Netherlands ITQ system that is based on local management groups, and emerged from a co-management system between regional producer organizations (Hentrich and Salomon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2006</xref>). ITQs may not facilitate diversified livelihoods (SCR-2), for example fishers exiting New Zealand’s ITQ systems were found to lack any alternative livelihood option (citation). Fishing fleet mobility, given that rights are over a stock rather than over a territory, contributes to social resilience by allowing vessel operators to access fish stocks that vary in or shift their distribution so long as they do not shift outside of the jurisdiction of the ITQ system (SCR-5). Higher mobility is most likely in technology-intensive commercial fisheries, where larger operators may be able to change their operation in response to fish redistributions (Fulton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2011</xref>; Holbrook and Johnson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, there will be important constraints to this flexibility, related to competition for new areas and restrictions imposed by international borders (Cheung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2012</xref>), as well as governance problems due to the changes in species’ distributions across national borders and the resulting implications for management institutions (Berkes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2006</xref>). Miller and Munro (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2004</xref>) propose side payments between two countries as a way to increase ITQ flexibility under climate change when countries face an environmental regime shift and the access to the resource varies in time. Finally, and despite the fact that little progress has been made in incorporating community-based management into ITQ systems (Arnason 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2005</xref>), the two approaches can be compatible (SCR-6), as observed for the case of the Tasmanian lobster fishery. There the success was due to a combination of ITQs with a strong tradition of participatory management (van Putten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2013</xref>).
