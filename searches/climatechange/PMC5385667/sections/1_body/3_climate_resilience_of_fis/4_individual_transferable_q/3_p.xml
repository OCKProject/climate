 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2009</xref>) reviewed 20 ITQ fisheries around the world finding that 12 stocks were improved after ITQ implementation, but they conclude that additional measures are still necessary to promote recovery, such as good enforcement and monitoring, or implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (Chu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>). For example, voluntary surveillance and monitoring institutions have been established under New Zealand ITQ fisheries (ECR-3) (Hentrich and Salomon
