<p class="p">ITQs have the advantage of providing stewardship incentives to quota owners, potentially resulting in more sustainable harvest (Costello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2008</xref>; Grainger and Costello 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, the social resilience of the fishery can be compromised as the implementation of the system of rights to owners may force excluded fishers to exit the fishery (Arnason 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2005</xref>). Livelihood diversification options may be more limited to these former fishers who have lost access to the resource, as they have lost a source of income. On the other hand, the ability of quota holders to retain rights to access shifting stocks enhances resilience via their choice between pursuing target species in their new distribution or selling their permits to others willing to do so. However, shifts in species distribution may move beyond the current jurisdictional borders of the ITQ system, which together with high prices for transferability may pose important challenges in the future.
