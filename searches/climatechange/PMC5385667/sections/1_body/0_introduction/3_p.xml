<p class="p">We define a SES as a coupled and integrated system that encompasses social and ecological components that interact closely (LÃ³pez-Angarita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2014</xref>). Fisheries SES are regulated in diverse ways including community management, co-management, and strong top-down control rules (e.g., limited licensing of vessels). Fisheries regulatory regimes also vary in the extent of rights allocated to fishers (e.g., access rights, property rights) and regulations stemming from conservation measures that might be in place (e.g., marine protected areas). These institutional and regulatory characteristics can have important implications for how a fishery SES responds to climate change. For example, protecting particular age classes by using more selective gear (Cinner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2009b</xref>; Grafton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2009</xref>) or protecting key habitat by implementing no-take marine reserves (Allison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2003</xref>; Gaines et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2010</xref>) can buffer stocks against climatic shocks, helping fishers and communities to adapt. Similarly, promoting long-term resource stewardship, for instance via property rights, may provide incentives to fishers to apply more precautionary or adaptive management approaches in the face of looming climate change.
