<p class="p">While ecological resilience is traditionally defined as the 
 <italic class="italic">resistance</italic> of ecosystems or species to disturbance, and the speed of 
 <italic class="italic">recovery</italic> following disturbance (Holling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">1973</xref>); in social systems resilience is related to the disturbance, reorganization, and renewal of communities and institutions (Grafton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2009</xref>). Here we define socio-ecological resilience as the ability of a SES to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organization, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2007</xref>, Davidson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2013</xref>). Socialâ€“ecological resilience refers to people and nature as inter-dependent systems (Folke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2010</xref>), where changes in ecological resilience affect social resilience and vice versa.
