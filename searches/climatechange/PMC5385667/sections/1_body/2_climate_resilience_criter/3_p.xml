<p class="p">Ecological criteria like Sustainable and age-diverse populations (ECR-1) and Conservation of biodiversity and habitats (ECR-2) have clear ecological benefits for resilience (Levin and Lubchenco 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2008</xref>; Perry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2010</xref>; Bernhardt and Leslie 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>), which can also enhance social resilience as fishers may have a more secure source of income when fish populations are sustainably managed (ECR-1). These social benefits can also arise in the longer run as habitats and ecosystems are in a good state (ECR-2). Managing existing stressors (ECR-3) is expected to increase ecological resilience (Barange and Perry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2009</xref>), but can have varying effects for social resilience. For example, decreasing stressors like pollution may increase revenues due to an increase in quality/quantity of fish, but can also compromise livelihood diversification through more restrictive regulations placed on other sectors (i.e., agriculture, Badjeck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2010</xref>).
