<p class="p">Fisher mobility (SCR-5) can increase social resilience, especially for industrial fisheries (Pinsky and Mantua 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2014</xref>) that have the capacity to change fishing grounds easily (Allison and Ellis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2001</xref>). For small-scale fisheries, mobility can be also be beneficial for accessing new areas that become more productive due to shifting stocks. In both cases, fisher mobility may decrease ecological resilience as fishers can deplete one area and move to the next, but may increase social resilience as fishers access new fishing grounds. This potential positive effect of mobility for social resilience could be limited, however, by negative interactions among ‘original’ and ‘new’ fishers in a given area. Finally, Community-based management (SCR-6) is expected to increase social resilience by enhancing the sense of stewardship and sensitivity of fishers to socio-economic constraints, and by allowing for the incorporation of local knowledge of the resource (Gutierrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2011</xref>). Community-based management is also a potentially useful approach to generate adaptive capacity (Rivera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">2015</xref>). Adaptive capacity refers to the ability to anticipate and respond to disturbances, and to minimize, cope with, and recover from their consequences (Maldonado and Moreno-Sánchez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2014</xref>). Community-based management has also been shown to improve compliance with rules (e.g., catch limits, size limits), monitoring, and surveillance (Gutierrez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2011</xref>) that will directly benefit ecological resilience.
