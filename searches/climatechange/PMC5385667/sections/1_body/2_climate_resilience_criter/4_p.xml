<p class="p">Social criteria, specifically adaptive management (SCR-1) is likely to increase ecological resilience by incorporating learning and new science into management (Plaganyi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rivera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2014</xref>), which can increase the likelihood that fishing pressure is sustainable and prepare fishers for abrupt and unexpected changes (Lehodey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2006</xref>). Diversified livelihoods (SCR-2) may promote social resilience by decreasing reliance on fisheries (Cinner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2009a</xref>; Defeo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2014</xref>; Pinsky and Mantua 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2014</xref>), but the impacts on ecological resilience remain unclear as fishers may engage in other activities that are damaging for the ecosystem, and/or lack stewardship incentives if they can easily exit the sector. Stewardship incentives (SCR-3) can increase ecological resilience as fishers may advocate for sustainable management. Stewardship is promoted under long-lasting access to the resource, which also contributes to social resilience (Essington et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>). Multi-level governance (SCR-4) increases social resilience by providing flexibility in resource management, for example by matching management scales to biological scales of the resources. Multi-level governance can also facilitate the implementation of adaptive management that increases ecological resilience (Hughes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2005</xref>). The Maine lobster fishery provides a good example of multi-level governance that led to careful monitoring, adaptive management, and sustainable harvest of the resource (Schultz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">2015</xref>).
