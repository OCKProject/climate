<p class="p">From a detailed review of the literature, we identify three ecological climate resilience (ECR) and six socio-economic climate resilience (SCR) criteria for assessing the resilience potential of fisheries management systems. We summarize these criteria in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, where we include the rationale supporting each criterion and references that support the link between resilience and the specific criterion. A more detailed description of the different criteria and supporting literature is available in 10.1007/s13280-016-0850-1.
