<p class="p">Most studies on the impacts of climate change on forests and rural development in South Africa have focused on biophysical impacts vis-Ã -vis temperature rise and erratic rainfall, among others (Davidson

 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), climate change manifestations in any community are particularly unique to economic, ecological and social characteristic of such community. In fact, there is increasing scientific evidence that highlights the importance of understanding the context-specific impacts of climate change (Claas

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Hence, the need to understand the susceptibility of forest-based communities to climate change impacts in South Africa. This understanding is fundamental for expounding climate change manifestations to a level where practical local intervention action is possible (Chinara
