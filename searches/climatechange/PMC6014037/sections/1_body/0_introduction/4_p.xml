<p class="p">Although perception of climate change impact is increasingly gaining recognition in disaster assessment (Williamson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), concerns about rural people’s ability to perceive climate change impact is equally increasing. Maddison (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) is of the view that rural farmers may take time to realise that unusual weather represents a permanent shift in the climate. Claas 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) argue that the majority of people rate the impact of climate change on an abstract, cognitive level which might lead to an underestimation of the hazards of climate change. However, efforts towards effective resilience improvement strategies and formulation of climate change intervention policies are difficult without an understanding of individuals’ perception of climate change impacts (Alexa 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). As noted by Davidson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), people’s perceptions of impacts will influence how and when households might start to take specific actions to adapt to climate change. An understanding of rural people’s perception of climate change impact on their livelihood is therefore crucial to improving the people’s resilience to climate change impact (Hansen 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). This is also essential in assuring that efforts to address climate change impacts correspond to actual concerns (Chinara 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
