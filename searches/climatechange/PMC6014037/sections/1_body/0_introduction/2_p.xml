<p class="p">Key sectors that are vital for rural development in South Africa such as forests, water resources, tourism and agriculture are vulnerable to climate change impacts (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Lazo, Kinnell &amp; Fisher 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Specifically, there is growing evidence that climate change impacts will diminish the capacity of forests to provide goods and services with serious implication to the livelihood of forest-based rural communities (Okali 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Moreover, close proximity and strong linkages to climate-sensitive environs of forest-based communities make them uniquely vulnerable to climate change (Boon &amp; Ahenkan 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Davidson, Williamson &amp; Parkins 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Because of their geographical location, forest-based communities are extremely exposed to recurrent environmental threats like forest fire, pest and disease out-break, and strong wind (Davidson

 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>); these risks can be exacerbated by climate change. In addition to being exposed to climate change impacts, forest-dependent rural communities in South Africa are also faced with socioeconomic challenges such as high unemployment rate, poverty and low economic development opportunity (Vhembe
