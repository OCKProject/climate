<p class="p">The perception of climate change impacts at household level has not received much attention of researchers in South Africa. Most importantly, the effects of climate change on local contexts, particularly in rural forest-based communities, are poorly understood (Turpie &amp; Visser

 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). This study therefore sought to address this gap by examining perceptions of local people on climate change impacts and pathways through which forest-based livelihoods in rural communities are impacted by climate variability and extreme weather events. It evaluated climate change impacts in the context of perceived exposure and sensitivity of essential forest products to climate variability and extreme event. The case study communities were forest-based rural communities in Vhembe District of South Africa.
