<p class="p">This study used perception-based analysis to examine the effect of climate variability and change on forests and sensitivity of forest-based livelihood to specific climatic events at rural community level in South Africa. It also highlighted the weakness of this method in analysing climate change effect. However, the method is insightful in understanding climate change manifestation at rural community level. The assessment suggests that manifestation of climate variability and extreme weather event is perceived to be increasing in the study communities. Analysis of the perception of these events as a threat to forest products and forest-based livelihood showed mixed results. Extreme drought was perceived to be a significant threat to only firewood availability. However, other climatic events such as erratic rainfall, extreme temperature and flooding were not perceived to constitute threat to any of the forest products used for livelihood. It could be argued that the non-perception of climate change impacts on forest products could mean that the studied communities may actually be more vulnerable to climate change than thought.</p>
