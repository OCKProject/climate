<p class="p">In general, the availability of other forest products (Fodder for livestock, medicinal plants, honey, mushroom, wild vegetables, thatch grass, timber, and forest fruits and food) surveyed in Makhado were perceived to have been significantly affected by climate variability and change (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0000). The perception was in the range of 59.9% â€“ 87.3%. In Mutale, the availability of firewood and thatch grass was perceived not to have been significantly affected by climate variability and change (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, the availability of other forest products, such as fodder for livestock, medicinal plants, wild vegetables, and forest fruits and foods, were perceived to have been significantly affected by climate variability and change (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The perception ranged from 53.2% to 87.2%. However in Thulamela, only honey, mushroom and charcoal were perceived to have been significantly affected by climate variability and change (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that forest products in Makhado and Mutale might be more exposed to climate risk than forest products in Thulamela. More specifically, forest products in Makhado seem to be the most exposed to climate risk. This notion is strengthened by Pearson Chi-square test which showed that there is a significant difference in observed variation in the perceived effect of climate variability and change on the availability of forest products between the municipalities (
