<p class="p">There are complex ways through which climatic variability and change can either directly or indirectly affect forests and forest-based livelihoods. 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows results of analysis of perceived effect of climate variability and change on access to forest for essential forest products used for livelihood in the study communities. There were generally significant differences across the municipalities in perceived effect of climate variability and change on access to forest products (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.000). For all the four climatic events analysed, in Makhado the response in access to the forest resource was similar (28% – 42%). However, for Mutale there tended to be a temporarily reduced access to the forest resource as a result of all the climatic events (73% – 91%). Interestingly, in Thulamela more people (50% – 58%) felt that there was no effect on access to forests. The difference in perceived effect of climate variability and change on access to forest in the municipalities can largely be attributed to the availability of more forests around and within study communities in Thulamela area.
