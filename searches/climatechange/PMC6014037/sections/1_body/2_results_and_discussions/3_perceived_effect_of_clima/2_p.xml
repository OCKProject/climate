<p class="p">We further investigated the perceived effect of climate variability and change on availability of essential forest products used in the communities for livelihood. 
 <xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows similarity in proportion of respondents in Makhado (68.2%) and Mutale (56.9%) that believed firewood is becoming scarce as a result of the effect of climate variability and change. The belief that the effect of climate variability and change is reducing the availability of firewood was significant in Makhado (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0000) but not significant in Mutale (0.1096). Similarly, 74% of the respondents in Thulamela significantly believed that climate variability and change were not having negative effect on the availability of firewood (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0000). The difference in the perceived effect of climate variability and change on firewood across the municipalities is similar to the trends observed in the perceived effect of climate variability and change on access to forest. Generally, it appears that forests in Thulamela are more resilient to current climate risks and are in a better condition to sustainably provide rural dependents with essential goods.
