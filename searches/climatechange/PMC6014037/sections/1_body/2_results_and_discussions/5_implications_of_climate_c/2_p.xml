<p class="p">The findings that more forest products in Makhado were perceived to be vulnerable to climate variability and change effect than in Mutale and Thulamela provided insight on possible influencing factor of climatic risk perception in the study community. In Thulamela, where there was abundance of forests that are in good condition, there was the least number of forest products that was perceived to be vulnerable to climate change impacts. In Makhado, although there were forests in good condition, the high population and associated socioeconomic pressure made the people to perceive most forest products to be vulnerable to climate risk. Although Mutale was located in the arid zone with more exposure to adverse effect of climatic event, fewer forest products than Makhado were perceived to be vulnerable to climate risk. Sustainable forest management and forest-based adaptation initiatives in the study communities will hence benefit from paying attention to socio-demographic characteristics of host communities.</p>
