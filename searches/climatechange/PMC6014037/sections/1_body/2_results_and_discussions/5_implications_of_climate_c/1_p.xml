<p class="p">Across the entire sampled communities, majority of respondents perceived increased occurrence of climatic and extreme weather events. These climatic events were perceived to have varying effect on access to forests and forest products availability. Observed variation in the perceptions of climate change impacts on forest products and sensitivity of forest products to key climatic impacting factors raises the concern about the ability of rural people to accurately perceive climate change impacts on their livelihood. Specifically erratic rainfall and temperature were perceived to pose no risk to forest-based livelihood, yet these climatic events are empirically proven to have significant impact on forest growth and vitality (Gauthier

In addition, in instances where some forest products (e.g. firewood) were perceived to be at peril to some key climatic events, the perception showed contrasting result. For instance, it was surprising to note that the people perceived firewood to be at peril to extreme drought event but did not perceive timber to be at peril to the same event. This contrast suggests that perception-based analysis is insufficient to accurately determine climate change impact on forest-based livelihood and vulnerability of forest products to climate change at rural community level. Another plausible explanation for this contrast could be that the respondents were more observant about products they used daily than those they use periodically. It could also be that the respondents overwhelmingly underestimated climate change impacts in their community. This notion has been argued by Claas

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), who postulated that the general public often rate climate change impacts on an abstract, cognitive level which might lead to an underestimation of climate change hazards. Similarly, Etkin and Ho (
