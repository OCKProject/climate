<p class="p">In contrast, we only observed a significant increasing trend in the occurrence of incidence of serious drought in Makhado and Mutale (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0000). In Thulamela, the incidence of serious drought was observed to be significantly decreasing (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00). The observed differences in the trend of occurrence of serious drought event in the three municipalities can largely be attributed to the state of water supply facilities in the municipalities. In Thulamela, tap water supply facility is widespread in all the rural communities, and there is a high level of satisfaction with water facility. Hence the effect of serious drought is substantially managed and less felt by the people. However in Mutale and Makhado where there was a high level of dissatisfaction with water supply facility, the effect of serious drought is greatly felt by the people. The situation is more alarming in Mutale, which is located in the arid region characterised with increased water stress challenges.
