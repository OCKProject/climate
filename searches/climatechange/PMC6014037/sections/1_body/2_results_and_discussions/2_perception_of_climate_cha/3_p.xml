<p class="p">Furthermore, binomial test analysis of respondentsâ€™ prioritised perception of the risk of climate variability and extreme events in their community showed that all four investigated climatic events (erratic rainfall, extreme temperature, serious drought and flooding) were prioritised as key climatic events for Makhado and Mutale municipalities. However for Thulamela only erratic rainfall, extreme temperature and extreme wind were prioritised as key climatic impact factors. Consequently, we postulate that forest-based livelihoods in Mutale and Makhado may be more at risk to climate variability and change than those in Thulamela. Increased occurrence of these climatic events can have significant impact on forests and forest-based livelihoods in the study communities. As observed by Mpandeli and Maponya (

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2008), rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall will lead to increased occurrence of drought periods in semiarid regions of Vhembe. This occurrence may lead to an increase in fire risks.
