<p class="p">Results in 
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> show that the majority of respondents in Makhado (59.2%), Mutale (70.0%) and Thulamela (58.0%) perceived that incidence of erratic rainfall had increased. In addition, the Bonferroni test shows that these perceptions do not differ significantly. The comparison analysis of perceived increase and decrease in erratic rainfall events in the three municipalities showed that there was a significant increasing trend in erratic rainfall event in all municipalities (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00). Similarly, we observed significant increasing trends in the occurrence of incidence of extreme temperature and flooding event in all the municipalities (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00). This is consistent with the findings of Davies 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) where mounting evidence of increase in climate variability and climate change was observed in many of the climatic zones of South Africa. Similarly, Naidoo 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) observed clear evidence of rising temperatures at the local level in Vhembe District and semiarid regions of South Africa.
