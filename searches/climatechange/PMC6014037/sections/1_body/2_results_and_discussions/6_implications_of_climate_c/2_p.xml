<p class="p">The study findings on the effect of climate change impacts on forest products and sensitivity of each essential forest products to specific key climatic events provided vital information that can be scaled-up and used to ensure that sustainable forest use and management with respect to climate change are maintained. Generally, the finding suggests that perceptions of climate variability and extreme weather impacts on forest-based livelihood are more influenced by socioeconomic pressure than actual manifestation of climatic events. This could be mainly as a result of the growing interaction between climate and socioeconomic pressure that impacts forest use and management in the area. Ensuring resilience of forest-based livelihood in the study communities will also require attention to overall communitiesâ€™ socioeconomic development.</p>
