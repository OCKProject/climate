<p class="p">In the context of perceived sensitivity of forest-based livelihood to climatic event, it is interesting to note that though the majority of the respondents perceived increasing trend in climatic events, they however did not perceive it to be a risk to forests and forest-based livelihood in their community. In Thulamela, more people perceived that the climatic event do not have effect on their access to forests. In Mutale, majority of people perceived the effect of climatic event on forests to be temporal, while in Makhado there was no clear pattern. Generally, the people are able to perceive climate change impact on non-wood forest product. Hence, honey, fodder for livestock, medicinal plants, wild vegetables, and forest fruits and foods were perceived to be most affected by the climate change.

For example, the people perception of climate change effect on availability of firewood and timber showed no clear pattern across the municipalities.
