To cover the various representations of forest-based livelihood types in the district, we use the criteria of vegetation types, and dominant livelihood strategy to select three municipalities: Makhado, Mutale and Thulamela for this study. In each of the selected municipality, we further selected a replicate of seven rural communities. This gave a combined total of 21 rural communities, which were then surveyed for this study. A total of 366 households were selected from the study’s 21 rural communities using stratified proportionate random sampling procedure. For questionnaire administration, respondents in a selected household were supposed to (1) be more than 20 years old and (2) have lived in their community for more than 5 years.
