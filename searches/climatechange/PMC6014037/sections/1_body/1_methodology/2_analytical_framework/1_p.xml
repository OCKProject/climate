<p class="p">The questionnaire used for the assessment of climate change impacts was adopted from the Climate Risk Assessment Guide developed by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Central Asia Climate Risk Management Program (UNDP 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The Guide uses a modification of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to define climate change impacts by looking at how short or long-term climatic events can affect different types of forest products used for livelihoods in the study communities. The use of questionnaires enabled identification of the communityâ€™s prioritised climatic hazard and comparisons of the results within as well as between municipalities.
