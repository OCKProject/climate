 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Respondents were then asked to tick the events that their household and livelihoods are exposed to. We further explored respondents’ perceived impact of these events to forests and forest-based livelihood in their community. A 4-point Likert scale (1 = No effect, 2 = Resources has become scarce, 3 = Increased difficulty in harvesting resource and 4 = Resource has become expensive) was used to analyse perceived effect and sensitivity of essential forest product to climate change impacts. A 3-point Likert scale was used (1 = No effect, 2 = temporary reduced access 3–4 months and 3 = reduced access for extended period of time of up to 5 months and above) to assess climate change effect on access to forests. A similar rating technique has been used by Asherleaf (
