<p class="p">We further analysed the sensitivity of essential forest products used for livelihood in the study communities to the identified key climatic events in order to ascertain whether there were any forest products that were perceived to be incurring more climate-associated threat. A binary logistic model was used to estimate sensitivity or relationship between perceived changes in climatic event and perceived effect of climate variability and change on essential forest products used by communities (Maddala 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>). Odds ratios were used to measure the magnitude of strength of association or non-independence between two binary data values. The sensitivity of the essential forest products, woody products (firewood, charcoal, timber or construction wood) and non-woody products (mushrooms, medicinal plants, thatch grass, bush meat or wild edible insects, wild fruits or vegetables) were tested. Perceived change in climatic event was framed as binary-choice models which assumed that respondentsâ€™ perception of the increase or decrease in woody and/or non-woody products dictated their perceived increase or decrease in climatic events. The perceptions are dependent on identifiable characteristics.
