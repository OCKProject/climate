<p class="p">Binomial test was used to analyse perceived increase and decrease of each climate and extreme events occurring in each municipality in order to identify significant (priority climate hazard identification analysis) key climatic events for each municipality (Berg 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The different climate variability and extreme weather events studied were erratic rainfall, extreme temperature, serious flooding, extreme drought, strong wind and incidence of hailstones. In this study, climate variability refers to the natural fluctuations of the climate system while an extreme weather event is a weather event that is significantly different from the average or usual weather pattern. We also used binomial test to analyse the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses of climate variability and change effect on forest products (Berg
