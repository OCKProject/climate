 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The growth trends (decreasing ring-width with increased age) were removed from raw ring-width data with exponential curves, which was necessary for examining the high-frequency growth variation associated with climate changes

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, the majority chronologies had an expressed population signal (EPS) &gt;0.8 except in two cases (which were not far from 0.8). This suggests that the qualities of the chronologies were good enough for further study
