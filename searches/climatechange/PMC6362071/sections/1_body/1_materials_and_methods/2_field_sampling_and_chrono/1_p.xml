<p id="Par8" class="p">To examine the altitudinal change of tree growth response to climate change, we established 15 plots (20 * 50 m) from 750 m to 1990 m (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). These plots covered all the major forest types distributed along the altitudinal gradient on the north slope of Mt. Changbai, including timberline forests (BEF, three plots), subalpine forests (four ENF plots, and two DNF plots), temperate forests (four KBF plots and two BPF plots). In each plot, we documented geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude). For each tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) &gt; 3 cm, the DBH and tree height were measured. In each plot we selected 25 canopy trees of one or two dominant species (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> for the species sampled), and extracted two tree-ring cores at 1.3 m from two vertical directions. The cores were sampled in the summer of 2006.
