<p id="Par10" class="p">Monthly climate data between 1959 and 2005 of the Erdao meteorological station, at the foot of Mt. Changbai (591 m), were obtained from the China National Climatic Data Center (

Our plots differed greatly in altitude and thus, for a better analysis of the growth-climate relationship, we estimated the historical monthly climate for each plot. For altitudinal changing rates of monthly mean temperature and total precipitation (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), we used the model of Wang

 </sup>. The model was developed based on 48 climate stations in the Mt. Changbai region (including the Tainchi station at the mountain top, 2623 m), and has been calibrated by independent climate data which showed that the model was accurate enough (the

 </sup>. For each plot, the climate variables in each month by each year (1959 to 2005) were estimated based on the altitudinal changing rates of temperature and precipitation in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. Then the RWI of the plot was related to these monthly climate variables to examine the growth response to climate change (see Supplementary Table
