<p id="Par11" class="p">We also calculated the multi-decades means of monthly temperature and precipitation for each plot, which were then used to calculate climate indices such as actual evapotranspiration (AET), mean annual temperature and precipitation, mean temperature for the coldest month, etc. These multi-decades mean climate indices were used to depict the climate condition of each plot, in order to evaluate the relative effect of climate gradient vs. biotic factors (e.g. forest type and height) on altitudinal patterns of growth response to climate change.</p>
