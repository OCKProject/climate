<p id="Par13" class="p">To examine the potential drivers for altitudinal changes of growth variability (MS, SD) and RWI-climate correlations, we used general linear models (GLM) to explain these variables with explanatory terms as follows. (1) Altitudinal climate gradient. We used AET to depict the climate condition of the plots, because AET reflects the simultaneous availability of energy and water and is widely used as proxy of climate productivity of vegetation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. Other climate variables, such as mean annual temperature and precipitation, were highly correlated with AET and thus not used to avoid collinearity. (2) The forest type of each plot (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). (3) Forest height. Here we used the maximum tree height of the plot, which is a commonly used surrogate (e.g. ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>). We also used the mean height for the trees that tree-rings were sampled to repeat the statistical analyses, and the results were similar as using forest height. This is not surprising because we cored dominant canopy trees. (4) Stem density of each plot. (5) Maximum stock volume for the trees in a plot. Previous studies have found that RWI-climate relationship differed between large- and small-DBH trees

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting the potential role of tree size on growth response to climate change. We used volume instead of DBH because volume is a better metric for tree size than DBH or height (e.g. ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>). In the preliminary statistical analyses, we have included interactions in GLMs. However, the interaction terms were not significant or showed only weak effects, and thus were excluded from the final analyses.
