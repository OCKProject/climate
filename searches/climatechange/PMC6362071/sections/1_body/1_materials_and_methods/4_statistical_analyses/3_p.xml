<p id="Par14" class="p">To identify the most important factors affecting growth variability and RWI-climate relationships, we first used the model selection approach based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to obtain the most parsimonious model, which is more conservative in retaining variables than commonly used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
