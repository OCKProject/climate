<p id="Par12" class="p">We used MS and SD of the chronologies as indicators of temporal growth variability of radial growth. For growth-climate relationship, we related RWI of each plot to monthly temperature and precipitation from June of the previous year through September of the current year (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Because we are interested in the abiotic and biotic drivers for the altitudinal change of RWI-climate relationship, we selected some correlations for further statistical analyses based on two criterions: (1) the correlation should show significant change with altitude (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05); (2) the monthly climate variable should have significant correlation (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with RWI in at least three plots. As a result, the following correlations were selected: the correlation of RWI with temperature and precipitation of current June and previous July (Cor_c6T, Cor_c6P, Cor_p7T and Cor_p7P, respectively), and the RWI correlation with current July temperature (Cor_c7T) and previous June precipitation (Cor_p6P). We also conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to check the results (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), using the correlations between RWI and monthly climate variables of the 15 chronologies. The PCA1 loadings of the 15 plots were highly correlated with elevation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.84, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), suggesting that PCA1 can well reflect the altitudinal patterns of RWI-climate correlations. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, the PCA1 scores (absolute value) were the highest for Cor_p7T, Cor_c6T, and Cor_c7T (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1b</xref>), and Cor_p6P, Cor_p7P and Cor_c6P (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1c</xref>). Thus the PCA results confirmed that the correlations we selected were major components of altitudinal change of growth response to climate change, and are well suited for our purpose. While there were still some other significant correlations in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, they did not reveal clear altitudinal patterns or occurred in only one or two plots. These correlations may be caused by local abiotic and biotic factors specific to the plots, which were not our focus and not further analyzed.
