<p id="Par7" class="p">Mt. Changbai (41°43′–42°26′N, 127°42′–128°17′E) is situated at the southeast border of Jilin Province, northeast China. The climate in this region is characterized by warm summers, cold winters, abundant precipitation and a short growing season, largely controlled by the East Asian monsoon. With increasing altitude from mountain foot to top, mean annual temperature decreases from 4.9 to −7.3 °C and mean annual precipitation increases from 600 to 1340 mm

 </sup>. As a result, different forest zones are distributed along the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Changbai. (1) 500–1100 m: Korean pine and broadleaf mixed forest (KBF), dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus koraiensis</italic> and mixed with broadleaf species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus mongolica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Tilia</italic> spp. In this forest zone there are also secondary forests of KBF, e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Betula platyphylla</italic> forests (BPF). (2) 1100–1700 m: evergreen needle-leaved forest (ENF), composed of 
 <italic class="italic">Picea jezoensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Abies nephrolepis</italic>; and deciduous needle-leaved forest (DNF) dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Larix olgensis</italic>. (3) 1700–2000 m: 
 <italic class="italic">Betula ermanii</italic> forest (BEF)

 </sup>. Thus, the mountain provided an idea place to examine the abiotic and biotic drivers for altitudinal change of growth response to climate change.
