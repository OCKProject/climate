<p id="Par20" class="p">Previous tree-ring studies along geographic gradients generally focus on the change of RWI-climate relationship, instead of the temporal growth variability during climate change. Our study sampled 15 plots across a large altitudinal gradient from temperate to timberline forests. We showed that growth variability (MS and SD) increased at higher altitude on humid mountains, even when different altitudinal zones were included (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Previous studies have noticed that MS and SD changes with altitude. In humid regions MS and SD were generally found to be higher with increasing altitudes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>, while the converse altitudinal pattern was commonly observed in arid regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup>. This difference is generally explained by the fact that: in arid regions, the water deficit at low altitudes is critical in limiting radial growth, but the stress is alleviated at higher altitudes and thus growth variability is lower

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the two contrasting altitudinal patterns are actually consistent, in that MS and SD are higher under harsher climate

 </sup>. In addition to changes along altitude, other studies also found that MS and SD differed markedly among forest types (species) under similar climate (e.g. ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>). For instance, Liang 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup> found that MS and SD decrease from early- to late-successional forests in a same site in northeast China. These results suggest that species identity may be another important factor affecting MS and SD in addition to environmental condition.
