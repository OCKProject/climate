 </sup>). Height is a key dimension of tree size, and is closely related to not only DBH and tree age but also productivity. Thus in theory height ought to have a critical in affecting the growth response to climate change. We suggest that more studies are needed to test the relative influence of tree height, age, species identity and climate, for a better understanding of temporal growth variability under climate change.
