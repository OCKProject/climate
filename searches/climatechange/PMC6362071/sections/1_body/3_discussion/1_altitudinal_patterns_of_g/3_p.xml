<p id="Par22" class="p">Forest (tree) height has seldom been used to explain MS and SD before. However, in a few tree-ring studies that have documented forest height (or tree size), we also found evidence that MS (SD) decreased with taller forest height

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, in a study that MS and SD increased with higher altitude on a humid mountain, forest height decreased sharply with increasing altitude

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, on an arid mountain in northwest China, MS and SD decreased while tree height increased with higher altitude

 </sup>. In another study along a successional series, MS and SD decreased from early- to late-successional forests, accompanied by an increase in forest height towards late-successional forests

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the potential role of forest height was not explored in these studies. Some studies have examined the influence of DBH, and found that large-DBH trees have lower MS than small-DBH ones

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
