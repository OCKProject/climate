<p id="Par21" class="p">With these previous results, we had expected that climate and forest types would be the strongest predictors for MS and SD. However, only forest height was retained in the final models (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). This result does not mean that climate and forest type have neglectable influence on MS and SD. Note that AET and forest type significantly explained 36–65% of variance in MS and SD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3),</xref> thus they were excluded from the models simply because their collinearity with forest height. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that forest height is a very important predictor for the temporal variability of radial growth.
