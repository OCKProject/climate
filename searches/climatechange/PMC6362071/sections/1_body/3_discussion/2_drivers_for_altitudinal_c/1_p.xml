<p id="Par25" class="p">Many studies have reported that RWI-climate relationship changes along altitudinal gradients. Summer temperature was generally found to be the limiting climate factor of tree growth at high altitudes, while water-availability was the limiting factor at low elevations

 </sup>. Our results on the altitudinal change of RWI-climate correlations are generally consistent with these previous findings. For instance, RWI was positively related to current June and July temperature in high-elevation plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), consistent with the “growth limitation hypothesis” that growth of timberline forests is limited by growing season temperature

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>
 </sup>. At low altitudes, RWI was positively related to current June precipitation while negatively related to current June temperature, a typical indication that water availability is limiting for radial growth (e.g. ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>
 </sup>). This limiting effect disappeared towards high altitude, which is a commonly-reported pattern because of increased precipitation and decreased temperature with higher altitude

 </sup>. Influence of previous summer climate on current year growth (i.e. the lag effect) is evident in our study. Interestingly, previous and current summer climate showed not only contrast effect on growth but also converse altitudinal pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>). Similar contrast effects of current and previous summer climate on radial growth have also been found in previous studies in humid regions (e.g. ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>), and is generally interpreted by the fact that rapid growth in the current year will reduce the nutrients stored in trees that can be used for next year growth
