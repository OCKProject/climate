<p id="Par26" class="p">Our results support the idea that these altitudinal patterns can not be explained by climate gradient alone. Forest type had the highest importance in each model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). In only one model (Cor_p7P) forest type was excluded, but this is again because the explanatory power of forest type was included in AET and do not mean it has neglectable influence (note that in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> forest type explained 62.8% of variation in Cor-p7P, only slightly lower than the 66.2% of AET). Thus, in contrast to previous studies that have included only one forest zone or species, we conclude that forest type is the most important factor leading to different RWI-climate relationship, while altitudinal climate gradient plays a second role. Recent studies along latitudinal have also suggested that the geographic change of RWI-climate relationship is shaped by climate gradient and forest type together
