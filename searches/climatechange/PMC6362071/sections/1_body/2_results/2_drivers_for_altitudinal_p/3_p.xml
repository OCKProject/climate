<p id="Par19" class="p">In multivariate analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), forest height is the only predictor retained in the final models (based on BIC model selection) for MS and SD. As for RWI-climate relationships, the four predictors together explained 74% to 97% of variation in the six correlations. Forest type was retained in most models and had the highest importance value (0.45–0.61) in each model. AET was retained in all the models, and its importance (0.13–0.95) was also high in most cases. Despite lower importance (0.05–0.16) than forest type and AET, density and forest height were retained in most models, suggesting that they still played a necessary (though not strong) role in shaping the altitudinal change of RWI-climate correlations. On the other hand, maximum volume was excluded from all the models.
