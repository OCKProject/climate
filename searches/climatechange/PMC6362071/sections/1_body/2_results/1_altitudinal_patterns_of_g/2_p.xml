<p id="Par16" class="p">The correlations of RWI with monthly climate variables were reported for each plot in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. There were six correlations that showed significant altitudinal patterns (i.e. met the two criterions that we set in the Methods). The correlation of RWI with current June (Cor_c6T) changed from negative at low elevations to positive at high altitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). The altitudinal pattern of Cor_c7T was similar and thus not drawn (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.65). Conversely, the correlation of RWI with current June precipitation (Cor_c6P) changed from positive at low altitudes to negative at high altitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Climate in the previous summer also showed clear altitudinal patterns. RWI’s correlation with previous July temperature (Cor_p7T) was negatively related to altitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>), while the correlations with previous July (Cor_p7P, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>) and June precipitation (Cor_p6P, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.43, similar as Cor_p7P and thus not shown) were positively related to altitude.
