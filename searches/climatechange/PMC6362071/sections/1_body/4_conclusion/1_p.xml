<p id="Par28" class="p">In summary, our study showed that both growth variability and RWI-climate relationships varied regularly across different forest types along an altitudinal gradient in northeast China. We also examined the relative importance of climate, forest type, height and density in shaping these altitudinal patterns (probably the first one along altitudinal gradients). We showed that forest height is the most important predictor for MS and SD, while forest type and climate were more important for RWI-climate relationship (with height and density still played a necessary role). The importance of forest type and height highlight the necessity for future studies to test the effect of forest structure (species composition, height and density, etc.), on not only RWI-climate relationship but also growth variability. If these effects are verified across latitudinal (altitudinal) gradients, then forest structure should be considered when predicting global forest growth in response to future climate change.</p>
