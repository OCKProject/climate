<p id="Par4" class="p">In addition to forest type, other biotic factors may also influence the growth response to climate change. For example, greater tree height leads to greater difficulty in transporting water from root to canopy

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>, thus the growth of taller trees may be more sensitive to water deficit than small trees under the same climate condition. Consistent with this prediction, some studies have found that the growth of larger-DBH or older trees (which were generally taller trees) were more sensitive to climate change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. Meanwhile, tree density was also found to have significant influence on growth sensitivity to water deficit (e.g. ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>). Tree height and stem density are widely observed to change markedly with altitude and latitude

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. Thus the changes of RWI-climate relationship may not be the sole result of climate gradient and different forest types across latitude (altitude), tree height, size and density may also play a significant role. Here we tested this hypothesis along a large altitudinal gradient.
