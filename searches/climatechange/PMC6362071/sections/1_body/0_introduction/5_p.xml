<p id="Par6" class="p">We sampled tree rings from 15 plots along the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Changbai to examine the drivers of different growth response to climate change. Specifically, we asked three questions as follows. (1) How does RWI-climate relationship and growth variability change across different forest types along the altitudinal gradient? (2) Does biotic factors (including forest type, height, size and density) affect the altitudinal change of RWI-climate relationship and growth variability? (3) What are the differences in the abiotic and biotic drivers between RWI-climate relationship and growth variability?</p>
