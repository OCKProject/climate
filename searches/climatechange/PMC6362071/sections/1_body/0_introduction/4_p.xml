<p id="Par5" class="p">While most studies have focused on the altitudinal pattern of the growth-climate relationship, another important aspect of growth response to climate change, i.e. temporal growth variability, has remained less examined. Studies have found that chronology statistics, e.g. mean sensitivity (MS) and standard deviation (SD), also changed across altitudes

 </sup>. MS is a measure of year-to-year growth variability, and is commonly accepted to reflect the growth sensitivity to high-frequency variation in climate. Meanwhile, SD reflects the multi-decadal growth variability in a chronology, which was related to the low-frequency fluctuation in climate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the altitudinal changes of MS and SD can provide valuable information on how growth response to climate change varies along altitudinal gradients. However, the two metrics have largely been used as indicators of chronology quality in many studies, and the abiotic and biotic drivers for their geographic patterns have been less explored

 </sup>. Consequently, a second aim of our study is to examine this question. Meanwhile, RWI-climate relationship and growth variability are distinctive aspects of growth response to climate change. Thus the relative roles of climate, forest type, height and stem density on their altitudinal patterns are expected to be different. A third aim of this analysis is to examine how the abiotic and biotic drivers differ between growth variability and RWI-climate relationship.
