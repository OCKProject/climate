<p id="Par3" class="p">Altitudinal gradients are ideal places to examine the different response of tree growth to climate change across environmental gradients. Many studies have found that the relationship between ring width indices (RWI) and climate varies with altitude (e.g. ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>) and latitude
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. However, many studies have included only one forest zone or examined the different growth response of a single species across elevations (e.g. ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>). Consequently, the altitudinal change of RWI-climate relationship was generally explained as a result of different climate at different elevations. However, large altitudinal gradients generally cover different forest zones. This is similar to the latitudinal gradient and thus more useful in understanding the different growth response to climate change at broad scales. Other studies have found that different forest types (species) under a similar climate may show contrasting growth response to climate change, suggesting that species identity is another key factor leading to different growth response
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, different forest types distributed along elevational gradients may contribute to the altitudinal change of RWI-climate relationship, but its relative effect vs. climate gradient has not been well quantified.
