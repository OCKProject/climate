<p class="p">To further elucidate the features of shifts in the suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in Asia, particularly in traditional 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> production areas, we expanded the scope of the study area to include North Korea, South Korea, Japan and areas of Russia that border northeast China. We added 26 occurrence data of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in these areas, and we obtained soil type variable data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD,

We then used the same method as applied previously to simulate the influence of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in these areas. The final results were derived from the average of the three general circulation models (GCMs) and four IPCCâ€“CMIP5 representative concentration pathways (
