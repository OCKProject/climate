<p class="p">The model forecast indicated that at present, the highly suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is mainly located in east-central South Korea and central Japan. By the 2050s, highly suitable habitat has largely disappeared; in Japan, it is extensively reduced and shifted northward. By the 2070s, highly suitable habitat appears in east-central North Korea, and in Japan, it continues to decrease and move north. Over time, the suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in South Korea and Japan declines sharply and shifts to high-latitude areas, whereas in North Korea, the range of suitable habitat gradually increases. The marginal habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> under climate change in the whole area remains largely stable, with the boundary shifted northward. By the 2070s, little area of marginal habitat appears in Russia.
