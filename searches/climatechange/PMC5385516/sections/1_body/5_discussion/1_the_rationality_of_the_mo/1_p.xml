<p class="p">The distinctive life cycles and growth forms of fungi pose unique challenges for mapping fungal species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. SDMs provide a possible solution to this problem. The 19 bioclimatic variables used in this research were derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values, which capture annual ranges, seasonality, and limiting environmental factors. Compared to monthly temperature and rainfall values, bioclimatic variables are more biologically meaningful. Furthermore, these data have been proven to be useful for SDMs and are among the most widely used data sets
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. In contrast to plant species, fungal species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>, will not grow in the absence of suitable vegetation and soil conditions, even if climate and topography are favorable. Thus, soil type and vegetation type variables should be considered limiting factors during the modeling process. Because of their specific growth requirements, fungal species are considered vulnerable to climate change.
