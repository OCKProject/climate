<p class="p">MaxEnt originated from maximum entropy theory and is one of the most popular tools for species distribution modeling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. MaxEnt focuses on fitting a probability distribution for the occurrence of a species to the set of pixels across the study region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. The theoretical basis for MaxEnt is that for appropriate constraints, the best explanation for unknown phenomena will maximize the entropy of the probability distribution. When modeling species distribution, these constraints consist of the values of those pixels where the species occurs. MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods in terms of predictive accuracy
