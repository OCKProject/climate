<p class="p">The natural reproduction ability of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is also a key factor affecting its distribution. As an ECM fungus, the reproductive characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> are similar to those of other ECM fungi in nature. The species surrounds living plant rootlets, has a strong host preference, and expands its populations by dispersal of basidiospores, fragmented mycelia, mitotic sporulation, and sclerotial and extraradical mycelial extension

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> has more stringent environmental requirements for its reproduction, particularly precipitation and temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. Therefore, the continuous development of global warming will affect the natural reproduction ability of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in traditional habitats, further aggravating the influence of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> distribution.
