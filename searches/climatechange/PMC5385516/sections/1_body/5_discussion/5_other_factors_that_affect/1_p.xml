<p class="p">In addition to climate change, human interference is an important factor that influences the distribution of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. As the popularity of this mushroom increases in both the domestic and international food markets, wild resources of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> are being depleted. Theoretically, 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> can be distributed in all highly suitable habitats; however, due to anthropogenic effects, such as over–grazing and excessive deforestation, some traditional habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> no longer host this species, and the phenomenon of habitat fragmentation is irreversible. Many efforts have been made to establish an artificial cultivation system for high–quality

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> can be conserved only by maintaining and increasing natural production in highly suitable habitats. Fortunately, with increasing societal interest in environmental protection and the enactment of relevant laws and regulations, 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> shiroes are increasingly protected, especially in nature reserves. In addition, artificial introductions into appropriate wild environments have expanded the native habitat of this species.
