<p class="p">To further elucidate the features of climate and geography that created the suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>, we created different MaxEnt models using only one of the corresponding variables mentioned above. According to the quantitative relationship between environmental variables and habitat suitability (logistic probability of presence), we created response curves that illustrate how the logistic prediction changes as each environmental variable changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). According to the response curves, we calculated the suitable ranges of environmental variables for the distribution area of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> (logistic probability of presence &gt;0.3). The ranges are 600–1300 mm for bio12, greater than 0.41 for bio3, 10–13.5 °C for bio2, 7–23 °C for bio10, 0–22 °C for bio1, 14–27.5 °C for bio5, 400–1300 mm for bio18, 1000–4400 m for elevation, and greater than 3 degrees for slope. The logistic probability of presence increased gradually as the slope increased.
