 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> produced a preliminary summary of the climate environment characteristics in 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>-producing areas in the Hengduan Mountains in southwestern China. This study reported that 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> mainly grows at altitudes between 3600 and 4000 m and on steep slopes. These areas are in humid or semi–humid parts of the alpine cold temperate zone or the sub–high mountain cold temperate zone, with a clear distinction between the dry season and rainy season. The annual precipitation is 800–1000 mm, with a smaller annual range of temperature and a larger diurnal temperature range. 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> growth occurs in the rainy season, and the yields depend mainly on the amount of rainfall from June to August. During this period, 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> grows normally and has high productivity if the monthly rainfall depth is 100–200 mm. Conversely, severe and persistent drought from June to August will decrease 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> production and quality. During the growth phase, large temperature differences between day and night are a key factor for the growth and development of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>. During this time, the temperature should be 18–25 °C during the daytime and lower at night. Higher diurnal temperature variations will promote mycelial proliferation, differentiation, and fruiting during the squaring period. This record is consistent with the results of our model and further confirms the scientific and practical rationale of the model.
