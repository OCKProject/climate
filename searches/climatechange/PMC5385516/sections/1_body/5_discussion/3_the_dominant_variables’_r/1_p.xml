 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, the main gaps in current knowledge of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi include the environmental and ecological factors that control mycorrhizal distributions at the landscape and larger scales. MaxEnt provides a practical method to solve this problem. Using an iterative method, MaxEnt determines the relative contributions of environmental variables to species distribution. With each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable and vice versa

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. In this research, the estimates of the relative contributions of the environmental variables indicate that bio12 (Annual Precipitation), bio3 (Isothermally), and bio2 (Mean Diurnal Range) are the key factors that determine the distribution of

In addition, the bio10 (Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter), bio1 (Annual Mean Temperature), bio5 (Max Temperature of Warmest Month), bio18 (Precipitation of Warmest Quarter), elevation, and slope variables had relatively high contributions to the distribution of
