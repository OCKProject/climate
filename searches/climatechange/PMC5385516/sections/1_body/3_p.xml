<p class="p">In this study, species presence data at 91 locations and 24 climatic and environmental variables were analyzed using MaxEnt to predict the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in China. MaxEnt was also used to simulate the potential habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> under four climate warming scenarios (RCP 8.5, RCP 6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6, given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC))
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. The objective was to select key environmental variables that are highly correlated with 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> distribution and to predict the impact of climate change on the potential habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>. Our results will supply advice for the protection and sustainable utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> resources and establishing measures and proposals for the prediction of the distribution of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms under different climate change conditions.
