 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Thus, future changes in climate are likely to induce biodiversity loss and may lead to changes in habitat distribution, habitat fragmentation, and an increased risk of extinction of endangered plants

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Empirical evidence demonstrates that plant and animal species have responded to recent climatic change by shifting their distributions poleward and to higher elevations

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. These range shifts are likely to continue in many regions, resulting in range expansion or contraction or even extinction for some species

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Over the past few decades, many studies have focused on the effect climate change has on the spatial distribution of plant species, but few studies have examined the regional distribution of endangered ectomycorrhizal mushrooms
