 <italic class="italic">Tricholoma matsutake</italic> is an ectomycorrhizal fungus associated with Pinaceae and Fagaceae trees in China, Korea, Finland, the United States and Japan
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. In China, suitable habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> are mainly located in Yunnan Province, Sichuan Province, the Tibet Autonomous Region, Guizhou Province, Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province. Due to its medicinal effects and attractive flavor, 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is one of the most economically important ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in Asia, particularly in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Modern pharmacology has confirmed that the polysaccharides and terpenoids extracted from the fruiting body of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> have antitumor and antioxidant properties
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. In the wild, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is extremely slow and limited to strict environmental conditions. 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> grows only in high crown-density primeval forests without pollution, and thus the populations of this species are limited. The influence of ecological factors, such as temperature, moisture, soil properties, and terrain, on the development of the 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> fruiting body remains unclear
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Since artificial cultivation is unavailable, natural populations of this species are under increasing threat, primarily from habitat disturbance and destruction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Thus, determining the potential geographic distribution of this species and predicting how climate change would affect its geographic range are necessary and meaningful.
