 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Using 19 bioclimatic variables and 3 topographic variables, MaxEnt provided satisfactory results, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the training and test data sets were 0.976 and 0.961, respectively. The AUC value of the MaxEnt model that used only the soil type variables was 0.925 for the training data set and 0.803 for the test data set. Thus, the model results can be considered satisfactory.
