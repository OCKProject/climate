<p class="p">Using the projected bioclimatic variables and the same topographic, soil type, and vegetation type variables, we reassessed the current 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> distribution to reflect a changing climate. These predictions provide a comprehensive assessment of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> habitat suitability. Using the same standard of classification, the future habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> was classified into four classes. The final results were derived from the average of the three general circulation models (GCMs). The model forecast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4</xref>) indicates that under all four climate change scenarios and for both periods, the area of marginally suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is relatively stable. The area varies from 0.19 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (under RCP 2.5 in the 2050s) to 0.24 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (under RCP 6.0 in the 2050s). The area of suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> decreases gradually under all four climate change scenarios. By the 2050s, the area of suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> under the RCP 8.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios is 0.066 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 0.089 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 0.10 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and 0.11 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively. By the 2070s, the area of suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> continues to decline. This tendency is pronounced under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Under this scenario, the area of suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is 0.049 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, only one-third of its original size. The suitable habitat area in central Yunnan also decreases significantly. Similar decreases are predicted in southeastern Heilongjiang and northeastern Jilin, along with increased habitat fragmentation. The highly suitable habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> significantly decline and nearly disappear under all four climate change scenarios. By the 2050s, only 0.93 × 10

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> km

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and 16.7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the highly suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> remain under the RCP 8.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios, respectively. By the 2070s, the highly suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> in China decreases sharply, and only a small area in northwestern Yunnan, central Sichuan, and southeastern Tibet remains.
