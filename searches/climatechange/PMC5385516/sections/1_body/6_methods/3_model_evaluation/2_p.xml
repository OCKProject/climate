<p class="p">Using the 19 bioclimatic variables, 3 topographic variables, and the 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> occurrence data, we used MaxEnt software (MaxEnt version 3.3.3,

 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>. MaxEnt has been extensively adapted to predict species range shifts under climate change and is based on the maximum entropy modeling technique. During the modeling procedure, 75% of the occurrence data were used for model calibration, and the remaining 25% of the data were used to test the predictive ability of the model. To guarantee the accuracy of the model, we performed 10 replications, and cross validation was maintained in the replicate runs. The AUC was used. The AUC ranges from 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination), and values &gt;0.8 indicate satisfactory performance
