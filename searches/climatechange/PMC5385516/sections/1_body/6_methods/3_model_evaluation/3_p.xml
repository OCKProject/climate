 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is a forest ectomycorrhizal fungus and is predominantly associated with coniferous trees in northeastern China but has been found in broad–leaved forests consisting of 
 <italic class="italic">Castanopsis</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> spp. and alpine shrubs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. Therefore, the type of vegetation-environment suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> is precisely known, and we defined two habitat suitability values for the vegetation type variable. A suitability value of 1 was used for coniferous, mixed coniferous, bushwood, and broad–leaved forests, and a suitability value of 0 was used for all other vegetation types. Because there are no explicit soil conditions for the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic>, we created a MaxEnt model that used only the soil type variables to assess the suitable requirements. Therefore, the distribution of comprehensive habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">T. matsutake</italic> was defined as follows [
