<p class="p">Topographic variables including elevation, slope and aspect are important factors for the distribution patterns of vegetation. Elevation variables at 30″ (approximately 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) resolution were downloaded from the WorldClim database. The ArcGIS spatial analysis function was used to obtain the slope and aspect variables from the elevation data. The source of the soil type variables was the 1:1 million soil database of China; the data set was provided by the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RESDC) (

The vegetation type variables were obtained from the 1:1 million China vegetation data set provided by the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. Both the vegetation type and soil type variables had a resolution of 30″ (approximately 1 km
