 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) for this study. The bioclimatic variables were downloaded from the WorldClim database. These variables were generated using averaged interpolated climate data from 1950 to 2000

The potential values for bioclimatic variables under future climate conditions in the 2050s (average for 2041–2060) and 2070s (average for 2061–2080) were derived from three GCMs (CCSM4, MIROC5, and BCC–CSM1–1) under four IPCC–CMIP5 representative concentration pathways (RCP: RCP 8.5, RCP 6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6). The bioclimatic variables for the future scenarios were obtained from the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (
