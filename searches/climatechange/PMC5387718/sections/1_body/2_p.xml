<p class="p">The Afromontane vegetation is divided into three altitudinal belts, each with unique floristic composition

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>: the lowermost Afromontane forest (1300–3000 m), the ericaceous belt (3000–4100 m), and the uppermost Afroalpine zone ( &gt; 3550 m). These vegetation belts are not continuous in their distribution but appear divided into forest patches isolated from one another by environmental barriers (
