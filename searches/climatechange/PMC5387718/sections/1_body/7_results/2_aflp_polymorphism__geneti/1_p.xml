<p class="p">To complement the plastid signal (above), we carried out an analysis of fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) in the nuclear compartment. The final data set after scoring comprised 773 loci. The Bayesian software STRUCTURE assigned individuals to four geographic clusters based on patterns of genetic variance (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 4, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2.2</xref>). These clusters were broadly coincident with those recovered by the haplotype network: i) a cluster of populations on the eastern side of the main Rift System (Harenna Forest, Agere Maryam and Aberdare Mts.), ii) the Abyssinian Plateau, iii) the Central Highlands, and iv) the Albertine Rift (Rwenzori Mts.). Neighbour-joining and neighbour-net diagrams (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2.3a,b</xref>) identified six well-supported groups coincident with main mountain ranges within the Rift, except for a group (Agere Maryam) that had a low bootstrap value (72.6%). The two populations of the Abyssinian Plateau were also genetically very close. Principal Component Analysis (PCO) of genetic variance also differentiated six groups: those of the eastern Rift occupied the centre of the plot, with the remaining located on the periphery (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2.4</xref>). Genetic differentiation among populations (Fst values) was higher among the western populations (Debre Markos, Mt. Elgon and Rwenzori, 0.28–0.38) than among those in the eastern side (Harenna Forest, Agere Maryam and Aberdare Mts., 0.17–0.21; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2.6</xref>), suggesting greater isolation among the populations west of the Rift than between those in the east. East of the Rift Valley System, a rarity index (frequency-down-weighted marker value, DW) was highest for the Harar Massif population, which also presented the highest number of polymorphic and private fingerprints (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Populations in the Central Highlands (Mt. Elgon and Cherangani Hills) had the highest DW values and a large number of polymorphic fragments, plus two fixed fragments. Populations west of the Rift Valley showed generally lower values of genetic diversity and no fixed fragments. No linear relationship was found between pairwise F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> and geographic distance (Mantel analysis, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.1884, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.5012; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2.5</xref>). However, the correlation increased after excluding Mt. Elgon’s population from the analysis (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.6198, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0560; see black stars in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2.5</xref>). This population showed the largest genetic distance in pairwise-comparisons in relation to all other populations (Table 2.6, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2.5</xref>). In contrast, the population of the Abyssinian massif, which is separated by 500–1300 km from the southernmost populations (Mt. Elgon, Rwenzori), showed much lower pairwise F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2.6</xref>). All intervals analysed with SPAGeDi (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2.6</xref>) gave a significant negative result, suggesting that populations are not more different with increasing distance. In agreement with this, BARRIER detected three major boundaries separating the four STRUCTURE clusters: i) Rwenzori Mountains from Mt. Elgon (100%), ii) Mt. Elgon from all areas in the east (100%), and iii) Abyssinian massif from the remaining areas (99.7%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). Hierarchical AMOVA showed the greatest genetic variance among the same four groups identified by STRUCTURE and BARRIER (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2.4</xref>). The relatively low among-group genetic variance (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2.4</xref>) might be explained by the limited number of populations sampled at each side of the Rift, and therefore should be taken with caution. Yet, the geographic structure recovered by AMOVA is fully congruent with the results from the Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE and BARRIER) and with the Fst and DW estimates, lending support to this analysis.
