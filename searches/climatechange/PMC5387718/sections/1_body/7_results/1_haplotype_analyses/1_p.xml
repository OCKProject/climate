<p class="p">In order to examine patterns of genetic variation within 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic>, we sequenced three highly variable plastid (pDNA) regions covering the entire distributional range of this species (see Materials and Methods). We generated 237 new sequences from 79 individuals: 
 <italic class="italic">rpl</italic>32-
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>LUAG (79 sequences), 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>SGCU–
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>GUCC (79 sequences), and 
 <italic class="italic">pet</italic>B1365–
 <italic class="italic">pet</italic>D738 (79 sequences). The number of nucleotide sites ranged from 648 in 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>SGCU–
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>GUCC, 834 in 
 <italic class="italic">pet</italic> B
 <sub class="sub">1365</sub>–
 <italic class="italic">pet</italic>D
 <sub class="sub">738</sub>, to 963 in 
 <italic class="italic">rpl</italic>32-
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>L
 <sub class="sub">UAG</sub>. The concatenated matrix consisted of 79 sequences of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> with 2445 nucleotide sites. The haplotype network recovered by TCS identified nine haplotypes (H1 to H9; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>), divided into two main groups separated by five substitutions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>): one group east of the Rift Valley (Harenna Forest, Agere Maryam, and Aberdare Mts.), and a second group including populations of the Abyssinian massif, west of the Gregory Rifts, the Albertine Rift, and the SMSI. All haplotypes, save H5 and H7, were restricted to one population. Lineage divergence time estimation in the Bayesian software BEAST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2.1</xref>) supported a similar geographic structure. The first population divergence event (1.92 Ma, 95% high posterior density (HPD) credibility interval (CI): 0.63–3.82 Ma) separated the populations situated at each side of the Rift Valley, with subsequent divergence events (starting 0.4 Ma) dividing populations located within each side of the Rift System (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). We performed a phylogeographic analysis using Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction methods in BEAST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a,b</xref>); these were not conclusive, supporting a geographic origin of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> in the Harar Massif or the SMSI, on each side of the main Rift System, with nearly equal probability. Nine migration routes were inferred by Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS, see M&amp;M) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2.5</xref>); these seem to be arranged into parallel routes, following migration from north to south and vice versa on each side of the Rift System, and connecting also the intermediate mountain ranges (
