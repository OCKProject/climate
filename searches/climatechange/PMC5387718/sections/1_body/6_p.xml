<p class="p">In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeographic history of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> among and within populations. Our aims were to: i) describe the geographic distribution of genetic variation within this species; ii) examine the role of the Rift Valley as a long-term dispersal barrier; iii) understand how Pleistocene climatic fluctuations might have affected population ranges, especially in relation to the “mountain-forest bridge” hypothesis and the role of isolated “sky islands”; and iv) provide insights into the phylogeography of an Afromontane epiphytic species. Since the epiphytic growth of this species is tied to dominant tree species of the Afromontane forests, it makes 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> a good case study for tracing the history of fragmentation and expansion of forest coverage in this region.
