<p class="p">The complex phylogeographic structure found in African highland species has also been explained by two non-mutually-exclusive dispersal-migration scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>.): I) the “mountain-forest bridge” hypothesis postulates that current patterns might be explained by short-range or stepping-stone dispersal (SSD) between adjacent mountain ranges on each side of the Rift Valley, which would have been promoted by a more extensive forest coverage during Plio-Pleistocene warm and humid interglacial periods

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>; II) the “long-distance dispersal” hypothesis postulates that long-distance dispersal (LDD) events among isolated mountain populations during Pleistocene glacial periods are responsible for the observed phylogeographic patterns

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. For example, proponents of the SSD forest bridge hypothesis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> suggested LDD migration among some isolated mountain ranges
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. A requisite to discriminate between these two scenarios is a temporal framework. Most Eastern African phylogeographic studies in plants do not include time estimates for colonization events and, therefore, do not allow discriminating between the mountain-forest bridge and long-distance dispersal hypotheses. This is further aggravated by the difficulties intrinsic to collecting material of widespread Afromontane species, due to the complex geographic landscape and the recent political instability
