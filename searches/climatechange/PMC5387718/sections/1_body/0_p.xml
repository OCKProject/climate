<p class="p">The Afromontane Floristic Region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref> refers to a plant assemblage where a series of isolated highland forested areas are separated by lowland vegetation, and form an “archipelago-like” centre of endemism in the mountains of East and West Africa. The eastern part of this floristic region has been singled out as a biodiversity hotspot and is known as the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> (EABH) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). The Eastern African “sky islands” (including both high plateaus and isolated mountain peaks), are sometimes referred to as the “Galapagos of Africa”
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, and contain such flagship species as the mountain gorilla, the gelada, the Ethiopian wolf, or the coffee tree. These mountain ranges exhibit extraordinary levels of species endemism, for example, out of the &gt; 10.000 plant species found in this region (7600 vascular plants), about one third are endemic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. This pattern of endemism has been attributed to long-term climatic stability, favouring lineage diversification and species accumulation over time
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. The EABH is also one of the most threatened ecosystems in Africa
