<p class="p">Amplified fragments were analysed using GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems), and peaks ranging between 100 and 500 bp recorded. AFLP Scorer software
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref> was employed to run a reproducibility test, with the maximum acceptable error for each primer combination fixed at &lt; 5%
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>. The AFLPdat R package
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref> was used to determine the numbers of private fragments per population. Only unambiguous fragments shared among duplicates were scored. Data reliability was assessed by comparison of duplicates, using one or two individuals per population (21 tests). The reproducibility value was 88–100%, with a mean of 97.5%.
