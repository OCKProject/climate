<p class="p">Haplotype analyses were done on a concatenated dataset comprising all three sequenced plastid regions (see above). Genealogical relationships among haplotypes were inferred via the statistical parsimony algorithm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref> implemented in TCS 1.2.1
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>. The number of mutational steps resulting from single substitutions among haplotypes was calculated with 95% confidence limits, with gaps coded as missing data. Summary statistics for genetic diversity calculated for each population were: number of haplotypes H (n), haplotype diversity (Hd), and nucleotide diversity (π); using DnaSP 5.1 with the option “not consider gaps” selected
