It is based on a continuous-time Markov Chain process where the discrete states correspond to the geographic locations and the state transition rates to the migration rates between areas (Ronquist &amp; Sanmart√≠n, 2011).

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" class="xref">63</xref>) was used to identify the rates (colonization routes) that are best supported by the data, using a cut off value of three for the Bayes Factor comparison. We defined six discrete areas, assigning each plateau and Rift mountain ranges to a different area
