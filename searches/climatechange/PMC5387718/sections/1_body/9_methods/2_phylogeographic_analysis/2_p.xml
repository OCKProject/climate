<p class="p">Haplotype divergence times were estimated using Bayesian relaxed clocks implemented in the software package BEAST v.1.7.5
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref> and using the ‘nested dating approach’ described in Mairal 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>; in this approach, a high phylogenetic-level dataset, including representatives of all three species of 
 <italic class="italic">Canarina</italic> and nine outgroup taxa from Platycodoneae and Campanulaceae, was used to inform the clock rate of a linked population-level dataset of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic>, under a mixed Yule-coalescent model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref>. Congruence among results from the three plastid markers was tested by comparing clade support values for individual clades. See
