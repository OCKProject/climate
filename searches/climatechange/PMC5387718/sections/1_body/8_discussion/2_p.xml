<p class="p">A strong phylogeographic structure with the Great Rift Valley at its central axis was recovered for

In contrast, the large geographic distances and comparatively lower genetic distances between populations located on either side of the Rift Valley, suggest that geographic distance played a minor role in structuring patterns of genetic variation within
