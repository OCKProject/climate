<p class="p">Both plastid and nuclear genetic data suggest a pattern of greater historical isolation among populations located in the western side of the Rift Valley than among those in the east (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Whether this is associated to greater past connectivity through forest patches (mountain-bridge hypothesis) in the east, or whether it reflects a more recent historical pattern associated to agricultural activity, is not clear. Similar to other studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" class="xref">50</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>, the highest level of genetic diversity was found in the Harar Massif, an area known for harbouring the best-preserved fragments of Afromontane forest (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>: Agere Maryam and Harenna Forest). This area may have acted as an important refuge for Afromontane forest organisms during glacial maxima. In the DPA analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic>, the Harar Massif was inferred as the source of migration events on the eastern side of the Rift (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>). For the western Rift, the SMSI was suggested as the ancestral area: these mountains harbour the highest plastid genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), though these results could not be corroborated with the nuclear data (no AFLP sampling). The two arcs of the Rift Valley (Albertine and Gregory Rift) meet geographically in the north on the Central Highlands (Mt. Elgon and Cherangani Hills) and in the South in the SMSI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). These two regions (Mt. Elgon- Cherangani and the SMSI) apparently act as secondary contact points where the two parallel migration routes mentioned above interconnect

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref>, and have been described as cradles of new genetic diversity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>. This is congruent with our results in 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic>, showing Mt. Elgon and the SMSI as a crossroad linking both sides of the west Rift System in the DPA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), and both exhibiting high levels of genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Mount Elgon is also the oldest and most species-rich volcano of Eastern Africa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref>, with endemic lineages that are related to groups in either the eastern
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref> or the western side of the Rift Valley
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. In contrast, the Afar Depression and the arid zone around the Turkana Basin seem to have acted as major barriers against gene flow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4b</xref>). The Afar Depression separates the eastern and western Ethiopian populations, north of the two volcanic arcs, while the aridity around the Turkana Basin and the Uganda Gap, might have constituted an important obstacle to gene flow between the eastern and western populations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>. The low haplotype diversity found in the Abyssinian massif population could reflect long-term isolation due to the influence of glaciations, though a low DW value suggests that recent dispersal could be a more likely explanation.
