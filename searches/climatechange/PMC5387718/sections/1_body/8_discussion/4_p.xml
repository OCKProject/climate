<p class="p">Which mechanisms are behind this pattern of geographic isolation between the two sides of the Rift Valley for 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> and other Afromontane taxa ? As mentioned above, the origin of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> considerably postdates the formation of the Rift, so strict vicariance is not feasible (nor for any of the groups in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, the major faults and flooding of graben associated to the Rift activity, may have acted as a corridor filtering migration, spatially restricting dispersal to two parallel paths on either side of the Rift Valley. Indeed, the volcanic desert of Afar in Ethiopia (the hottest place on Earth), and the drier floor and deep lakes at the bottom of Rift Valley, are ecologically very different from the surrounding higher elevation areas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>, and constitute ecological barriers to dispersal (i.e., hostile environments that are beyond the tolerance limits of montane organisms). It would be interesting to test this hypothesis using genetic and ecological evidence in other lineages exhibiting a similar pattern of genetic isolation along the Rift Valley (
