<p class="p">In summary, our study suggests that the topography and land formations of the Great Rift Valley underlie the phylogeographic pattern of east/west vicariance observed in 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> and other Afromontane endemic species. Though population sampling was limited to discriminate between the “mountain-forest” bridge and the LDD hypotheses, Pleistocene climatic oscillations and cyclical expansion and contraction of the Afromontane forest appear to have played a role in structuring levels of genetic variation in these species. Short-range dispersal among forest patches on each side of the Rift probably was complemented by LDD across some regions such as the Turkana Basin or the Uganda Gap, historically devoid of montane forests. Isolated sky-islands such as Mount Elgon or the Harar Massif acted as both refuges and cradles of genetic diversity. Given that the forested areas of Eastern Africa are currently in serious decline
