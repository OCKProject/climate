<p class="p">Another explanation for the east/west connectivity pattern and the observed low genetic variance between populations on each side of the Rift in 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> and other Afromontane endemics, is long-distance dispersal of seed and pollen through vectors such as wind, insects, or birds; this in turn could have been reinforced by wider forest coverage in the past, i.e., greater area availability for seedling establishment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Long-range seed dispersal is likely the best explanation for connections among populations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic> across the Turkana Basin and the Uganda Gap, which probably constitute ecological barriers (climatically unfavourable land) for gradual SSD migration through forest connections. Results from the plastid DNA suggest seed dispersal on each side of the Rift Valley, with more recent connectivity among the eastern side populations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">3</xref>). On the other hand, the strong interpopulation structure found in the nuclear AFLP data suggests limited pollen dispersal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). This could be explained by the strong territoriality and reduced mobility of Nectariniidae birds, the presumed pollinators of 
 <italic class="italic">C. eminii</italic>. Some recent studies on these birds have revealed cryptic species within the same lineage occupying different mountain ranges, probably due to low connectivity between populations
