<p class="p">Geographically, the Eastern Afromontane region is divided longitudinally by the Great Rift System, a 4830 km north-south fissure whose terrestrial section extends from Djibouti to Mozambique. This orogenic fault marks the line along which the African Plate is splitting into two tectonic plates, the Somalian Plate and the Nubian Plate (

In the south tropical East Africa, the Rift System is divided into two arcs: the Eastern Gregory Rift and the Western Albertine Rift, which join at the northern end of Lake Malawi, where the Southern Mountain Sky-Islands (SMSI) lie (

Because of its geographic position, the Rift System is considered one of the most isolated mountain ranges in the world, compared to other tropical floras
