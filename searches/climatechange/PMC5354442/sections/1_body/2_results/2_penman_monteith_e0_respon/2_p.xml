<p class="p">Next, we examined the sensitivity of projected E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> responses to input of wind speed and crop height, which appear in the aerodynamic term. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> (right column) shows MJJAS E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends for the Northern Great Plains for differences in the aerodynamic term due to (i) modeling tall versus short reference crops, and (ii) using daily wind speeds versus monthly wind speeds averaged from daily values. In general, the results show that (a) tall crops estimate E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> roughly 20% higher than short crops, and (b) the use of daily wind speed also yields higher E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> than for monthly wind speed, although the magnitude of that difference depends on the crop type (surface roughness). Furthermore, interannual variability is higher for daily wind speed and tall crop type. These factors also affect 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century trends in percent of historical mean and standardized anomalies, however differences due to the choice of input parameters are much smaller relative to the differences found between the three different E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations in the previous section (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Although in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> we only show the sensitivity of Penman-Monteith formulation to choices of radiative and advective terms based on GFDL-ESM2M, we find similar results with CanESM2.
