 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> (left column), we compare the following three cases for this analysis, using data from the GFDL-ESM2M model only: (a) fixed surface albedo (0.23) and parameterized longwave radiation balance based on FAO56, (b) fixed surface albedo (0.23) based on FAO56 but GCM-modeled longwave radiation balance, and (c) GCM-modeled net shortwave and longwave radiation balances. For the Northern Great Plains, the use of parameterized versus modelâ€™s longwave creates the largest difference for absolute values of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. The choice of fixed versus modeled variable albedo has very little effect on the trends. Overall, the radiative input choices have an extremely limited effect on differentiating the E
