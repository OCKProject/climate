<p class="p">Both GCMs show an increased tendency for droughts (as defined during the historical period) during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, although there are large differences based on the choice of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation and GCM. The drought tendency is much more pronounced for EDDI than SPEI across all formulations and models, however the difference between EDDI and SPEI plots is smallest for Penman-Monteith. Overall, CanESM2 projects a more drought-prone future compared to GFDL-ESM2M. A seasonal cycle is also apparent with increased cold-season drought projected in GFDL-ESM2M and increased warm-season drought in CanESM2. We expect that the difference between the EDDI and SPEI responses are primarily because, at any given time, EDDI is only sensitive to the evaporative demand (E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) while SPEI is responding to the difference of moisture supply and evaporative demand (Pâ€”E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>). Therefore, trends and model bias in precipitation will affect the SPEI responses. An increasing trend in precipitation, which is found for both models, can lessen or counteract a trend toward increasing dryness in SPEI. A positive trend in precipitation can also dampen the increase in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> through the complementary relationship [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] by increasing available moisture, thereby impacting EDDI. Another reason the future SPEI trends are weaker than the EDDI trends has to do with the fact that precipitation is much more variable than E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. In other words, P-E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> has a much wider distribution in the historic period than E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> itself. Therefore, when standardized relative to the historical distribution, future E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends will appear more augmented than future P-E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends, especially if future P trends are relatively small.
