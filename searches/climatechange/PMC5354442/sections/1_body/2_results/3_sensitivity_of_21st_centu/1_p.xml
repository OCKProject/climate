<p class="p">One approach to explore changing drought risk under climate change is to evaluate future projections of currently used drought indices. Here, we examine 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century projections for the Northern Great Plains domain in two drought indices: the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI; [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI; [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]), as a function of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation and climate model selection. As mentioned in the Methods section, the SPEI index calculated and plotted here uses the same standardization method as used in calculating EDDI in order to better compare the EDDI and SPEI projections. However, for EDDI, positive values denote drier conditions, whereas for SPEI, negative values denote drier conditions. We compare the projections of these indices between GFDL-ESM2M and CanESM2 which have different biases and climate sensitivities. GFDL-ESM2M has a cold/wet bias for the Northern Great Plains, where CanESM2 has a hot/dry bias in the historical period. Furthermore, CanESM2 has higher global climate sensitivity to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase than GFDL-ESM2M. Given these differences, we would expect CanESM2 to yield EDDI and SPEI indices that project a more drought-prone future for the Northern Great Plains, relative to GFDL-ESM2M.
