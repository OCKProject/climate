 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> shows projections of 12-week EDDI and SPEI between 1950–2100 for the two GCMs. Each day’s (Day of Year, 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis within each plot) projected EDDI or SPEI value is binned into a specific percentile category (spanning between driest and wettest categories) relative to the historical (1976–2005) distribution. For GFDL-ESM2M, the primary difference is found in EDDI projections across the three E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations. Priestley-Taylor shows the strongest tendency for dry conditions throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Hargreaves-Samani shows a similar overall pattern to Priestley-Taylor, although the magnitude of the drying response is comparatively lower. Penman-Monteith shows the smallest trend for increases in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century drought risk, but still shows a positive drying trend in the late summer and fall period. On the other hand, the SPEI plots look very similar across the three E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations, and closer to the EDDI plot based on Penman-Monteith. For CanESM2, EDDI projections also differ much more across the three formulations relative to the SPEI plots. But for both indices, Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor show a more pronounced drying tendency relative to Penman-Monteith.
