<p class="p">GCM precipitation bias during the historical period can impact these drought indices in two ways. First, a cold and wet bias as well as lower climate sensitivity for temperature in GFDL-ESM2M strengthens P and attenuates E

Second, a hot and dry bias will make EDDI more sensitive to future climate warming as it increases the aridity of the modelâ€™s historical climate. An arid climate is more prone to conditions where the surface evapotranspiration cannot meet E

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (and therefore, EDDI) because of soil moisture-temperature feedbacks that amplify surface temperature and water vapor deficit (i.e., the basis of the complementary relationship [

A more detailed investigation of the relationship between GCM bias and drought projections is a topic of future research, as regional temperature and precipitation biases inherent in GCMs can strongly influence the trends in the 21
