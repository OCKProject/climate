<p class="p">Our analysis of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> responses across the three formulations shows that Penman-Monteith produces a more spatially heterogeneous response in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> as well as a more enhanced realization of the amplitude of interannual variability. We believe that both these features are a result of a more adequate treatment of wind-driven turbulence and relative humidity in Penman-Monteith, and therefore this formulation is particularly critical for regions, such as the southwestern US and the Great Plains, that are sensitive to these drivers. In the next section, we focus on just the Penman-Monteith formulation and examine how the E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> responses are further sensitive to the choices of input variables representing both the aerodynamic and radiative terms.
