<p class="p">Historical climatologies (1976â€“2005) of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> values across the CONUS for MJJAS, calculated from the three E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations with driving variables drawn from the GFDL-ESM2M and CanESM2 models, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, along with the observed MJJAS mean pan evaporation. In general, all three methods show a decrease in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> values with increasing latitude. However, the pattern is more spatially heterogeneous in the values estimated by Penman-Monteith. Most notable are the large magnitudes in the southwestern US and Great Plains region, which are less pronounced in Hargreaves-Samani and mostly absent in Priestley-Taylor. For both GCMs, the Penman-Monteith based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> maps most closely resemble the spatial pattern of pan evaporation. We also find higher magnitudes of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in Penman-Monteith, and in particular for the regions that are strongly influenced by wind-driven turbulence and relative humidity like the southwestern US and the Great Plains (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]). Wind speed and specific humidity are not adequately accounted for in the Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor formulations.
