<p class="p">Next we investigate 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century projections in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> between these three formulations. The primary intention here is less to evaluate what future E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> projections may look like and more to explore how different methodological choices affect these projected changes. First, we examine the future changes in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and their spatial variation across the CONUS. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> shows changes in mean MJJAS E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> by 2050 based on the three formulations as a percentage of the historical (1976â€“2005) mean. We use the t-test at 5% significance level to determine whether the projected change is statistically significant. These results show that, to the first order, the choice of GCM drives major differences in the projected changes. Overall, with the exception of one grid cell (in Priestley-Taylor based on GFDL-ESM2M), E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> increases by mid-21st century. CanESM2 shows significant increases in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> across the whole domain and for all the three formulations, while GFDL-ESM2M generally shows more modest increases than CanESM2, with large regions in the central and western US where the change is not significant when using the Penman-Monteith formulation. Across the three formulations, these projected changes also differ between the GCMs. For example, Priestley-Taylor gives the largest CONUS-wide increase in GFDL-ESM2M, while Penman-Monteith has that for CanESM2.
