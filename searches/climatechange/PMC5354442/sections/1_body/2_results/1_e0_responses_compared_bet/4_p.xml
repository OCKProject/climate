 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> shows E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends for MJJAS in seasonal totals, percent of the 1976â€“2005 mean, and standardized anomalies based on the three formulations and the two GCMs. Here again, large differences are evident between the three formulations in the magnitude of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, in the amplitude of interannual variability, and in long-term trends. The absolute E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> magnitudes are different between GFDL-ESM2M and CanESM2, with values for CanESM2 substantially much greater, in particular when estimated using the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves-Samani formulations. The warm and dry bias in CanESM2 is expected to cause this difference. Despite these differences between the two GCMs, we find that the Penman-Monteith-based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation is both higher in magnitude of mean seasonal totals as well as the amplitude of interannual variability relative to the other two formulations. Priestley-Taylor exhibits the lowest interannual variability, similar to results found for coefficient of variation in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Because both Priestley-Taylor and Hargreaves-Samani estimations yield overall lower magnitudes for climatological mean and amplitude of interannual variability in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, they have a large influence on the trends in percent of historical mean and standardized anomaly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>, bottom two rows), particularly the latter. For example, in the plots for GFDL-ESM2M (left column), Priestley-Taylor exhibits a comparably low E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> climatology (similar to Hargreaves-Samani) and the lowest interannual variability, yielding the largest 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century trends in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in both percent of historical mean and standardized anomalies.
