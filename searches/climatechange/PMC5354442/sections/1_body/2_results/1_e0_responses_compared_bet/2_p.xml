<p class="p">In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> we compare the coefficient of variation (CV) in seasonal (MJJAS) E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> across the CONUS between the three formulations driven by the data from the two GCMs for the 1976â€“2005 period, including the CV of observed MJJAS pan evaporation. Here again, there are large differences between the three formulations, with Penman-Monteith maps depicting the largest CV magnitudes, particularly in the Great Plains region. The CV is indicative of year-to-year variability in seasonal E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, an accurate depiction of which is required to adequately capture drought risks. Station-based pan evaporation observations confirm the maximal CV over the Great Plains region as found in the Penman-Monteith formulation, which the other two formulations do not adequately capture, in particular the Priestley-Taylor formulation.
