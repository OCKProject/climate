<p class="p">We have demonstrated here that methodological and dataset choices are crucial to the assessment of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century drought risk under climate change. Based on our findings, we would recommend a revaluation of results from previous studies that are based on projected trends in the standardized drought parameters. Furthermore, biases in GCMs affect the quantification of projected changes in evaporative demand and the drought indices based on it, introducing additional uncertainty. Use of physically consistent bias corrected and downscaled GCMs output at daily timescales will help to avoid the problem of GCM bias when exploring future drought risks across a suite of GCMs. Future studies examining trends in 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century drought risk should also attempt to incorporate the effects of increased water-use efficiency of plants at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels on E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in order to not overestimate the drying risk. Overall, an appropriate selection of methodology and dataset for E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation based on these findings will facilitate a better assessment of future drought risk.
