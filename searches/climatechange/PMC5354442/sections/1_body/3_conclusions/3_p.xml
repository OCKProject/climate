<p class="p">In examining the Penman-Monteith-driven E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> response under various input variable choices related to radiation, surface roughness, and wind speed, we found differences in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends. However, these differences are much smaller than the differences in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends from the three E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations. When making a choice for crop type, which determines surface roughness, we find that parameterizing for tall crop leads to higher (by about 20%) long-term mean E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and interannual variability, which ultimately impacts the projected standardized anomalies. We find that the use of the wind speed term averaged across different temporal scales (daily versus monthly) has a similar effect on both the estimation of long-term mean E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> value and interannual variability, i.e., monthly timescales lead to lower mean E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and interannual variability than daily timescales, but the magnitude of that effect varies with crop type. We also found that different choices in estimating the radiation term have a very limited influence on E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends into the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century.
