<p class="p">The choice of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation and specific GCM selection also have a large influence on the projected changes in standardized drought indices as shown by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>, which shows projected changes in summertime (12-week, August 31) EDDI and SPEI by 2050 for the different E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations and GCMs evaluated in this study. In the absence of an adequate number of GCM ensemble member runs available, we performed a Monte Carlo resampling (with replacement) of the data to provide uncertainty ranges for these estimates (5th to 95th percentiles). Positive changes in EDDI and negative changes in SPEI imply increases in drought intensity. Depending on the E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation and GCM selection, we see a large range in future changes in these indices, yet all results point to increases in drought conditions by 2050, except for the lower 25 percentile cases in GFDL-ESM2M for SPEI based on Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves-Samani. Overall, the use of Penman-Monteith formulation leads to more moderate increases in future drought risk while, for the most part, Priestley-Taylor causes the largest increases in drought risk, and Hargreaves-Samani falls between the two. As expected, the use of data from CanESM2, which has higher climate sensitivity than GFDL-ESM2M as well as a hot and dry bias, leads to a greater drought risk than GFDL-ESM2M.
