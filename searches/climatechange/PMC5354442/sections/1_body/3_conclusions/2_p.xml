<p class="p">We also find that Penman-Monteith is more appropriate for 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> projections and for drought indices that use E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, e.g., EDDI and SPEI. The 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends generated in our analysis, particularly trends in percent of historical mean and standardized anomalies, are found to be sensitive to the long-term mean value and the amplitude of interannual variability; i.e. if the magnitude of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and its interannual variability are relatively low for a particular E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation, then the normalized or standardized 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century trend based on that formulation is more amplified relative to other formulations. We find this to be the case with the Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor formulations, where the future standardized E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> trends are much larger than those from Penman-Monteith.
