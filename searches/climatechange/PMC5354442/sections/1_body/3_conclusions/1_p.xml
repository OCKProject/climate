<p class="p">In this study we evaluated how different methodological and dataset choices in the estimation of evaporative demand yield different assessments of temporal and spatial variability in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and trends in 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century drought risk. First, we evaluated these differential responses across three of the more widely used formulations for E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimations: Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves-Samani, and Priestley-Taylor. Our analysis shows that Penman-Monteith provides a more physically robust treatment of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> across the CONUS. This formulation gives a more spatially heterogeneous realization of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> because it is more sensitive to the variations in turbulent fluxes (driven by wind speed and surface roughness) and relative humidity. Penman-Monteith also facilitates a more physically robust depiction of the amplitude of interannual variability relative to the other two methods, whose interannual variabilities are much lower, particularly Priestley-Taylor. We also find regional patterns to this enhanced interannual variability in Penman-Monteith, such as in the Great Plains and southwestern US, which is corroborated by pan evaporation observations. This feature is not reproduced by Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor. Previous studies have also shown a greater importance of drivers like wind speed and relative humidity in these regions in driving interannual variability in E

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Therefore, the application of Penman-Monteith for E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation would especially be critical for regions where the influence of these drivers is strong.
