<p class="p">We use daily outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) Historical (1950–2005) and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5, 2006–2100) climate simulations from two GCMs: GFDL-ESM2M and CanESM2. Model specifications and their climate sensitivities are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> (sensitivity values given by Forster et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]), and the topography of the CONUS in each model is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>; more information about these models can be found in Flato et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. We use only the first ensemble member from each GCM’s simulations (only one member is available for GFDL-ESM2M) and we work with the data in their native grid resolutions. We select these models because of their availability of the required daily variables and their diverging biases and climate sensitivities. For example, in the Northern Great Plains region, GFDL-ESM2M has a cold (-1°C air temperature) and wet (+40% precipitation) bias while CanESM2 has a hot (+4°C) and dry (-10%) bias, with biases defined as the difference between the models’ historical climate and observations (where observations are drawn from University of Delaware v3.01 data, for temperature, and WMO’s Global Precipitation Climatology Centre v5 data, for precipitation). Furthermore, CanESM2 projects a 2°C greater warming by 2050 than GFDL-ESM2M for the Northern Great Plains (region shown by red boxes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174045.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), although both models project similar increases in precipitation.
