<p class="p">Pan evaporation is an alternative measure of atmospheric evaporative demand for which long term and spatially distributed observations are available, and is closely related to E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Pan evaporation observations are well-modeled by the PenPan equation, a version of the Penman method, indicating that physically-based Penman-type methods are able to capture the mean and variability of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, including sensitivity to individual drivers [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. We use station-based pan evaporation observations from the NOAA Cooperative Observer (COOP) Network to evaluate the ability of each E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> method to reproduce the spatial patterns of observed warm-season (defined here as May-September) E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and its interannual variability. The data consists of an extension of that described in Hobbins [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. That dataset was comprised of 228 stations reporting warm season (May-October) pan evaporation with at least 20 years of data between 1950 and 2001. Because here we define the warm season as May-September, we were also able to extend the dataset by adding 21 stations north of 41N latitude (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174045.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> for names and IDs of these stations). As noted in [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], the pan evaporation data require extensive quality control and homogenization due to documented and undocumented station moves and other factors. For the additional stations we followed the procedure in [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], including an adjustment in the mean when documented station moves occurred, and the removal of obvious outliers. We did not test for undocumented inhomogeneities for these stations. Instead, as in [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], further visual inspection of all station timeseries was used to add additional breakpoints in the data for homogenization (only two were added), and to eliminate two stations from consideration.
