<p class="p">We selected two operational drought-monitoring indices to quantify drought risk: the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI; [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI; [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]). EDDI, which is an emerging drought index, is based solely on E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, while SPEI evaluates the balance between moisture supply (precipitation) and demand (evaporative demand) in the atmosphere (a balance we hereafter refer to as P—E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>). Both indices can be computed for various time scales, and are intended to detect fast-evolving droughts (weeks to months) and characterize persistent seasonal and long-term droughts (months to years). While EDDI was originally developed for use with physically based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, SPEI was originally developed with a temperature-based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. Recent studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] have suggested that computing SPEI with a physically based formulation of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> might be more appropriate to avoid overestimating the effect of increasing temperatures on E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. We compute 12-week (i.e., roughly a 3-month season) EDDI and SPEI using the three E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations described above. Both indices are standardized relative to a 40-year climatology period (1966–2005).
