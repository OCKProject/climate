<p class="p">SPEI is an index of precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P-Eo). We computed 12-week SPEI using a modified version of the original procedure described in Vicente-Serrano et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. While the original study used a log-logistic distribution to compute the probabilities of P—E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> values at various scales exceeding the climatological median, their procedure did not account for seasonality and thus hindered the comparison to EDDI. In addition, when using daily aggregates of P—E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, we found the estimation of the parameters of the log-logistic distribution to be unstable. Therefore we adopted a non-parametric calculation procedure analogous to EDDI, as probability-based approaches allow for more consistent comparisons between standardized indices [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Just as described earlier for EDDI, daily P—E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimates were aggregated to continuous 12-week totals and ranked against the same-day 12-week accumulations within the reference period. SPEI values were determined from the empirical ranking probabilities relative to the reference period, also covering the range of ±2.14. In this case, positive SPEI values indicate wet anomalies while negative SPEI values indicate dry anomalies. As with EDDI, the range of SPEI values can also be represented by percentiles.
