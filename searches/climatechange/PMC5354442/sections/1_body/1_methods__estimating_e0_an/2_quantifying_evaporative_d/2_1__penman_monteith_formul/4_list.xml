   <italic class="italic">PM-FAO56</italic>). We compared this with E
   <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimates using GCM outputs for upward and downward longwave radiation while keeping the same fixed surface albedo (
   <italic class="italic">PM-gcmLW</italic>), and also including all the radiative terms from the GCM (i.e., where albedo is variable, 
   <italic class="italic">PM-gcmSWLW</italic>). We use this latter version (
   <italic class="italic">PM-gcmSWLW</italic>) to compare against the Hargreaves-Samani and the Priestley-Taylor formulations throughout this paper.

  <p class="p">Wind speed: we compared the use of daily wind speed inputs (as given by the GCMs) to the use of monthly mean wind speed (i.e., where daily values are made equal to monthly mean value). We chose to test this effect for wind speed alone because, among all drivers of E
   <sub class="sub">0</sub>, wind speed has the highest daily variability, and we hypothesized that using monthly means would thus underestimate the variability of E
