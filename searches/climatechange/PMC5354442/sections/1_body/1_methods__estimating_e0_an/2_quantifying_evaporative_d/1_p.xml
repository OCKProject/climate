<p class="p">Potential or reference evapotranspiration are widely used measures of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. Potential evapotranspiration is the idealized flux of water from a surface to the atmosphere under unlimited moisture conditions (e.g., [

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> because of their wide application both operationally and in research (e.g., [
