 </sub>, which is top-of-the-atmosphere downward solar (extraterrestrial) radiation, here given in mm day

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. However, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </sub> is derived from time of year and latitude only, so the Hargreaves-Samani method is considered temperature-based [

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation is the Thornthwaite method [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. However, that method was originally proposed for monthly data, while our analyses focuses on daily estimates. Here we employed the GCMs’ daily

 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">avg</italic>
