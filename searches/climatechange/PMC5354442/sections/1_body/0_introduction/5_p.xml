 <sub class="sub">0</sub>-based drought indicators can overestimate future drought predictions by not incorporating plants’ physiological response to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, i.e., and increased water-use efficiency that leads to a similar carbon uptake and photosynthesis for lower transpiration losses from the plant. As such the impacts of changes in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in climate projections should be interpreted with care. However, for the purposes of this paper, the use of a standard reference serves to isolate the methodological issues considered. Further, GCM generally have coarse spatial resolutions and land surface responses show significant uncertainties [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The assessment of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is therefore very instructive, particularly when we examine hydro-climatic processes at finer temporal and spatial resolutions relevant to regional impacts assessment, as well as taking the benefit of the more widely available downscaled GCM output of atmospheric variables.
