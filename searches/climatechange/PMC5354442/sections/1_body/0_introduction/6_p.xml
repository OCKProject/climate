<p class="p">Potential evaporation and reference evapotranspiration are widely used measures of E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. Historically, several different formulations ranging from simple temperature-based formulae to the more complex physically based methods (i.e., those that incorporate all the physical drivers—radiative and advective—that affect the energy balance that would hold over a wet surface in given climatic conditions) such as the Penman-Monteith [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], have been used to estimate this term (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]). Even within a single method, different choices of parameter estimation exist, e.g. Scheff and Frierson [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] found that Penman-Monteith-based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation shows 10–30% variation across the temporal scales of the input data (3-hourly versus monthly). Similarly, in the Penman-Monteith formula, different studies have used either short- or tall-crop coefficients (discussed later) which can considerably affect E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. While E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> estimation remains an active research area (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]) there is no clear set of guidelines or recommendations for user communities interested in assessing and quantifying climate change-induced drought impacts at regional scales. For example, the U.S. Department of Interior’s North-Central Climate Science Center is interested in better understanding the future drought trends in the Northern Great Plains region [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], in order to properly inform stakeholders and resource managers in their adaptation plans. E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is also an important variable for ecological applications, yet a number of habitat, species-distribution, and vegetation models still use simplified radiation-based methods to estimate E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> while investigating impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]). Another example is the commonly used Aridity Index (AI; [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]) for the assessment of future drought risk. While some studies employ the AI computed with physically based E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]), many others rely on AI computed using temperature-based methods such as Hargreaves-Samani [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] to assess impacts of climate change on ecosystems (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
