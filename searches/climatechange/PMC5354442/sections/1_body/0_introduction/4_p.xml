<p class="p">Of particular concern related to changing drought risk under climate change is the increase in E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> due to a warmer atmosphere, which could potentially enhance drying and heating of the land surface, causing more frequent, long-lasting, and more severe soil moisture depletions [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is both a driver of drought (i.e., it controls loss of water from the land surface) and an indicator of drought (through the complementary relationship between actual ET and E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, e.g.[
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). If properly estimated, E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is sensitive to physical variables such as net radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and it both influences and is influenced by soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks. Furthermore, E
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is extensively considered for agricultural and ecological impacts assessments, and many operational drought indicators (e.g., PDSI, SPEI, ESI, EDDI) use this term.
