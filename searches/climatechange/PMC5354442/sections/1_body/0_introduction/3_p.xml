<p class="p">Recently, there has also been a concerted effort to frame drought risk in the context of ecosystem impacts, where an episodic deficit in “ecologically available water” can potentially drive ecosystems beyond thresholds of vulnerability (e.g., widespread tree mortality, species habitat shifts), often with cascading impacts in coupled natural-human systems. In an effort to incorporate important ecological impacts that do not fit into existing drought definitions (i.e., meteorological, hydrological, or agricultural droughts [

 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which they define as “a prolonged and widespread deficit in naturally available water supplies—including changes in natural and managed hydrology—that create multiple stresses across ecosystems”. In this context, natural resource managers and decision makers must anticipate future drought risk and assess the uncertainty associated with projected changes as they develop regional drought plans [
 <xref rid="pone.0174045.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Part of the uncertainty in drought risk assessments arises from methodologies employed in the study, which include the choice of drought metrics, the methodology to estimate the various physical terms in those metrics (evaporative demand here), and uncertainties in global climate model (GCM) projections at regional scales [
