  <p class="p">Comparison of changes in 12-week EDDI and SPEI values for August 31 by 2050 (relative to the 1976â€“2005 mean) between the two GCMs based on the different E
   <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulations considered in this study. Filled circles show the mean change, box plots show 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers show 5th and 95th percentiles. Confidence intervals shown here about the mean projected change are estimated based on Monte Carlo resampling. Positive changes in EDDI and negative changes in SPEI signify increases in drought intensity.
