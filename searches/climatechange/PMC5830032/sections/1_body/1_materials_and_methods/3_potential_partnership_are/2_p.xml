<p class="p">We performed the moving window analysis for two partnership scenarios. Importantly, the partnerships identified in these scenarios are considered 
 <italic class="italic">potential</italic> because in most instances they are not likely 
 <italic class="italic">realized</italic>, but data on existing partnerships are uncommon so we cannot say conclusively which areas may actually be engaged in conservation partnerships. First, in an idealized scenario, we considered PAs and non-PAs combined (“PA &amp; non-PA partnerships”). Ecologically this scenario is desired because it selects potential partnership areas irrespective of socio-political boundaries [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, it is challenging to operationalize, so a second scenario examined potential partnerships only with respect to PAs (“PA partnerships”), recognizing that PA partnerships are favored by nature of PAs sharing a common mission to protect biodiversity and ecological processes. To address the selfish question of “what does my PA stand to gain by partnering?”, we included a null model of no partnering that took two forms, one in which no 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> cells partnered with any other areas (“null pixel model”), plus a second where partnerships occurred only among 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> cells of each administratively distinct PA (“null PA model”).
