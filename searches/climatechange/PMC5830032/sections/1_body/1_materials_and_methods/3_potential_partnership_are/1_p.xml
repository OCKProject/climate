<p class="p">We measured the five biodiversity adaptation indicators across a range of spatial scales that bracket existing and successful conservation partnerships around the world, defined by the maximum linear distance (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between pairs of potential partnering locations. Six radii (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> values; 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729 km) were chosen to bracket a range of partnership scales (29, 254, 2290, 20611, 185502, 1669521 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) encompassed by a suite of example established partnerships: e.g., Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and the Ancient Beech Forests of Germany, Slovakia, and Ukraine (~290 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>); Tongariro National Park, New Zealand (~800 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>); Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Canada (~23,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>); Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee, USA (~91,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, USA and Canada (~1,300,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The moving window calculations involving values of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> were performed at a spatial resolution of 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> on all continents and islands, except Antarctica, for both PAs and non-PAs.
