<p class="p">Higher values indicate greater relief and a denser hydrologic network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191468.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). For purposes of interpreting 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>, we treated the quantity [
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>âˆ’min(
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>)] as a unitless weight (i.e., multiplied by each target pixel on the hydrologic network). This resulted in 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic> having units of area (km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). In addition, because at this spatial resolution we were effectively capturing terrestrial areas 
 <italic class="italic">near</italic> hydrologic features, rather than the hydrologic features 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>, we considered 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic> to be more a measure of valley bottom area rather than hydrologic area. Hence, 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic> includes many likely riparian areas, but we did not differentiate riparian vegetation at these locations.
