<p class="p">Climate-area velocity was used to capture the importance of baseline climatic variation over a wide range of moving windows. We calculated climate-area velocity for both annual mean temperature and annual precipitation. While the following method and equation for calculating climate-area velocity is presented for temperature, the same procedure was used for precipitation, and it is readily extensible to other climate variables. The original climate change velocity calculation utilized the average maximum slope technique to calculate baseline climatic variation in a very small, fixed moving window (

However, that calculation for the denominator of climate change velocity cannot be easily employed for large moving windows (&gt;&gt; 3 × 3 pixels). Hence, for a given climate variable such as annual precipitation or annual mean temperature (

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>), we instead used its standard deviation (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) across target pixels (a constant of 0.1 was used to avoid division by zero; the same constant was also used in the null model involving zero partners), and because of this change we termed the resulting measure “climate-area velocity” (
