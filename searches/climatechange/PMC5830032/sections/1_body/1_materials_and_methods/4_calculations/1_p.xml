<p class="p">All calculations involved circular moving windows, but the partnership scale defined by the radius (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) could be modified for other shapes. Our values for 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> were chosen to yield window sizes that encompass six orders of magnitude (from 1 to 1669521 km
