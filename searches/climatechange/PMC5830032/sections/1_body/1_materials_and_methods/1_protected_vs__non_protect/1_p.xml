<p class="p">Following the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the United Nations Environmental Programme, and World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], we considered a PA to be “a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values” [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This definition encompasses a wide range of PAs, including “national protected areas recognised by the government, areas designated under regional and international conventions, privately protected areas and indigenous peoples’ and community conserved territories and areas” [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. We did not select PAs based on particular IUCN Protected Area Management Categories, for “the absence of a management category does not in any way reduce the importance of a protected area, nor does it imply that the site is not being adequately managed or should be excluded from analyses” [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Non-PAs were defined as all terrestrial areas that were not part of the WDPA. Our non-PAs included “other effective area-based conservation measures” [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], but we did not utilize these from WDPA because “there is as yet no agreed methodology to identify these areas, and there is no global database that compiles records of all such sites” [
