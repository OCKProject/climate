<p class="p">PAs from WDPA were first transformed from vector (polygon) to raster at 250 m resolution and then aggregated to 1 km resolution. The aggregation was performed in a way where the presence of only one PA cell at 250 m resolution (of 16 possible) was required to assign presence at 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This allowed us to retain a large number of small PAs (&lt; 0.5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in our global analysis. We rasterized a total of 157062 PAs using this method; 26809 PAs (17%) did not meet the 250 m resolution threshold (i.e., were less than 0.0625 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in area).
