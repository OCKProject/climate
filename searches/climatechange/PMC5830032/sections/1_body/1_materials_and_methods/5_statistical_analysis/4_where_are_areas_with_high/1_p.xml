<p class="p">Lastly, we combined the five biodiversity adaptation indicators in order to estimate overall climate change adaptation potential for PAs partnering under the PA &amp; non-PA scenario. These calculations were performed at the median scale for established and successful partnerships. Owing to differences in units among the indicators, we normalized each indicator based on its maximum global value, so that values ranged from 0 (little to no adaptation potential) to a maximum of 1 (highest global adaptation potential). Climate-area velocity was inverted in these calculations so that it corresponded in direction with the other four indicators. We averaged the normalized values across indicators and computed means by biome and ecoregion [
