<p class="p">We analyzed five indicators we argue are strong surrogates of biodiversity adaptation, which would be important for facilitating climate change adaptation of species, and are quantifiable using existing data over all terrestrial areas of the world. The total amount of land and freshwater area devoted to conservation is one such indicator, where larger areas increase protection for biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and constrained to a relatively small portion of world terrestrial areas, we include a fourth indicator―relief-weighted hydrologic area, which estimates the amount of area on and immediately adjacent to the hydrologic network, weighted by the elevational relief. Finally, to evaluate the feasibility of species moving in response to climate change, climate-area velocity—similar to climate change velocity [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] but quantifiable at large landscape scales—measures the increase in area required to maintain the current climate space in the future (see below).
