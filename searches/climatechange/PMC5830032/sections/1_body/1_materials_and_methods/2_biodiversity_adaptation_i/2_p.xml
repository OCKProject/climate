 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Estimates of future temperature and precipitation were based on the ensemble average of 17 individual climate models available through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5): ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M. Although an ensemble average masks variability among individual models, and individual model runs, this source of variability in climate-area velocity is generally small in relation to the spatial variability in climate across our various partnership scales (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012" class="xref">results</xref>). CMIP5 models were downscaled and calibrated (bias corrected) using a 1950–2000 baseline. We considered a 2061–2080 future (referenced as 2070) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. This RCP was selected because it is considered “business as usual” for greenhouse gas emissions and thus provides the most accurate estimate of our current climate change trajectory.
