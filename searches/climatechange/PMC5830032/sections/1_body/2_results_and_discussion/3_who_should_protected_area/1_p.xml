<p class="p">PAs comprise a relatively small amount of partnership area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191468.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). In terms of PA partnerships, partnership area with other PAs is, on average, 30%, whereas for non-PAs it is 19%. Furthermore, the amount of partnership area with ≥ 50% PA partners is 18% for PAs and 8% for non-PAs. Hence, non-PAs—areas that do not currently have as their primary purpose to support the long-term conservation of nature—are a significant potential contributor to partnerships worldwide. These results highlight the importance of thinking beyond the current world network of PAs when planning for climate change adaptation. Some non-PAs are publically owned and managed, so policies that facilitate governmental coordination offer opportunities to scale up conservation of PAs with other public non-PAs. However, many non-PAs are private (e.g., private lands comprise approximately 60% of the US), so additional policies are needed to encourage public-private conservation cooperation. Nonetheless, with approximately 86% of world terrestrial areas in non-PA status, the principal challenge for promoting climate change adaptation via partnerships lies in formulating incentive-based mechanisms for developing and sustaining partnerships among non-PAs.
