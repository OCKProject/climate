<p class="p">The range of partnership scales from 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 81 to 729 km encompasses a number of established and successful conservation partnerships from around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], suggesting it is a practical and achievable scale for conservation planning and coordination. At the same time, many successful partnerships are “old” in a climate change sense—having been established prior to climate change becoming a major issue of conservation concern—or their operational scales were set without the benefit of knowing precisely where and how climate change adaptation may favor biodiversity. In this context it is significant that our results for the biodiversity adaptation indicators at the scales associated with established and successful partnerships are considerably higher than (land and freshwater area, relief-weighted hydrologic area, latitudinal range, elevational range) and less than (climate-area velocity) those associated with the null PA model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191468.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). These results suggest that climate change adaptation gains through partnering may be substantial. Less than 1% of world terrestrial PAs are greater than or equal to a circular area where 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 81 km (i.e., the lower end, or 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile, of established and successful partnerships), further indicating that most PAs could benefit by scaling up their conservation actions through partnerships.
