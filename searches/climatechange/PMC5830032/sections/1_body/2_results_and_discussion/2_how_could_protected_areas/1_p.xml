<p class="p">Our results summarizing the benefits to partnering, using the median scale associated with established and successful partnerships (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 243 km), are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191468.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Compared to the null pixel model, the biodiversity adaptation indicators under the null PA model are 1.5x to 251x greater in magnitude. This suggests that PAs pursuing climate change adaptation, even in isolation as distinct administrative units, often reap adaptation benefits because of their size. However, these benefits are small in relation to those gained under partnerships. PA partnerships are 6.4x to 257x greater in magnitude than the null PA model. Thus, climate change adaptation should not simply require the addition of more land irrespective of who owns and manages the area. PA partnerships that seek to coordinate conservation practices among different PAs (e.g., because the PAs share conservation targets) stand to dramatically increase the effective scale of conservation. Furthermore, these benefits are maintained or even increased if PAs partner not only with other PAs but also non-PAs; under the PA &amp; non-PA partnerships scenario the biodiversity adaptation indicators are 7.5x to 724x magnitude greater than the null PA model.
