<p class="p">Contrasting results for the two partnership scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191468.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), each relative to the two null models, the two area indicators (land and freshwater area, relief-weighted hydrologic area) both exhibit especially large differences under PA &amp; non-PA partnerships. Meanwhile, results are more similar for both elevational range and climate-area velocity. These patterns are due to a combination of two factors. First, although PAs occupy less area than non-PAs, PAs also tend to occur in higher mountainous elevations compared to non-PAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which increases elevational range as well as the denominator of climate-area velocity. Second, because PAs only occupy about 14% of terrestrial areas globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], in a given moving window PAs will only include a fraction of all pixels. This results in lower estimates of area, compared to those obtained using all pixels (PA &amp; non-PA partnerships). Relief-weighted hydrologic area is noteworthy because the discrepancy between the two partnership scenarios is so large (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191468.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Although PAs can promote climate change adaptation by maximizing hydrologic elevational relief at smaller partnership scales, they can increase it tremendously more by partnering with non-PAs on a much larger hydrologic network. In other words, compared to terrestrial biodiversity, aquatic and riparian-associated biodiversity likely require partnering at broader scales.
