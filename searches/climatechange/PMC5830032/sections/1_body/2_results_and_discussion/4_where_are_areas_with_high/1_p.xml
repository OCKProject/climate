<p class="p">Partnerships offer opportunities to promote the climate change adaptation of biodiversity in areas that vary by level of development risk (conservation risk index, CRI) [

 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Globally the most threatened biome from development and lack of protection is temperate grasslands, savannas &amp; shrublands [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], but it also exhibits a moderate level of adaptation potential under partnerships (0.59, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191468.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>). As the worldâ€™s lowest ranked biome for percentage PA (4.4%), partnerships with non-PAs are especially important for promoting the biodiversity adaptation indicators on remaining natural lands, which have yet to be significantly transformed for human uses. Conversely, two of the three highly ranked biomes under partnerships (montane grasslands &amp; shrublands; and temperate conifer forests; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191468.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A</xref>) possess low CRI, while the third (tropical &amp; subtropical coniferous forests) has a moderate CRI [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. One of these (montane grasslands &amp; shrublands) has the highest percentage PA in the world (26.5%) and thus stands to benefit especially from PA partnerships. Similarly, ecoregions with high adaptation potential under partnerships and high vegetation intactness, but low climate stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], include northwestern North America (Canada and Alaska, USA) and northern Tibetan Plateau (

 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] include the Sierra Nevada Mountains (California, USA), south-central Mexico, the Andes and western ecoregions in South America, north-central Africa, northern Arabian Peninsula, and the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau steppe (
