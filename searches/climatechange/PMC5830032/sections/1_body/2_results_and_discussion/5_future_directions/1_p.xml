<p class="p">Our work contributes to the IPCC framework for implementing climate change adaptation by helping identify management options [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. PA partnerships with other PAs and non-PAs facilitate adaptation by promoting basic tenets of conservation biology. Our results emphasize the potential for existing PAs to steward a future for biodiversity in the face of climate change by serving as anchors for broader conservation partnerships. Such partnerships stand to play a pivotal role in the conservation of individual species and biodiversity at local to regional scales. Additional work is required to improve our biodiversity indicators and monitor how they change, especially taking into account invasive species and human land uses and how they impact our ability to restore habitats and conserve biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] (e.g., due to variation in dispersal, demographics, life history traits, etc.), monitoring speciesâ€™ responses would provide direct insights into the effectiveness of conservation partnerships, yielding results that further help managers strategize more proactive conservation tactics (e.g., assisted migration) or detect and prevent unintentional outcomes (e.g., transport of non-native species). Studies that explore the impacts of different climate change scenarios (e.g., warmer and wetter vs. drier futures) would further assist partners with conservation planning in the face of future climate uncertainty. New studies are also warranted for examining (i) partnership equality (e.g., ecological or logistical tradeoffs among partnering areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]); (ii) the directionality of partnerships needed under climate change (i.e., given directional changes in climate, partnerships may not be balanced and reciprocal, thus complicating incentives for partnering); (iii) the proximity, connectivity and representativeness [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] of partnering areas; and (iv) partnerships for special groups of species (e.g., marine or migratory species; species that are less able to track changes in climate). Finally, a clearer understanding is needed of the laws and policies supporting climate change adaptation in different countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0191468.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], including the mechanisms and incentives that promote cooperation.
