 <italic class="italic">b</italic>). Red and brown seaweeds (Rhodophyta and Ochrophyta) characterized the most sensitive axis of the wedge, accounting for 92% of observations in the bottom 10th percentile of the distribution (

 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). Twenty-three and 14% of total observations of brown and red seaweeds, respectively, were found along the high sensitivity axis, compared with 4 and 2% along the low sensitivity axis. By contrast, invertebrates (Arthropoda and Mollusca) accounted for 51% of observations in the upper 90th percentile of the distribution, while green seaweed (Chlorophyta) and vertebrates (Chordata) accounted for 18 and 14%, respectively. Forty-two per cent of total observations of Arthropoda were found along the low sensitivity axis of the wedge. All phyla displayed a broad vertical spread of TSMs consistent with the idea that marine organisms exhibit differing degrees of adaptive capacity, rather than a binary risk (

 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). The realized thermal niche breadth of species within the six main phyla ranged between 21 ± 8 and 29 ± 5°C (mean ± s.d.) with no overall difference between seaweeds and invertebrates or vertebrates.
