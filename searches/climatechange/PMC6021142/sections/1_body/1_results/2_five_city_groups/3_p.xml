 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref> shows the emission intensity’s mean values and SDs of the five city groups. The average emission intensity is 0.47 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in energy production cities, 0.31 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in heavy manufacturing cities, 0.23 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in light manufacturing cities, 0.15 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in high-tech cities, and 0.11 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in service-based cities. We find that among the five city groups, the energy production cities have the highest average emission intensity, while the service-based cities have the lowest value. The 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> test of mean values shows that the average emission intensities of the service-based and high-tech cities are significantly lower than those of the energy production and heavy manufacturing cities at the 0.05 level. In addition, the average emission intensity of the light manufacturing cities is significantly lower than that of the energy production cities at the 0.05 level as well (see Materials and Methods). The SDs of the energy production and heavy manufacturing cities’ emission intensity are the largest among the five city groups (0.34 and 0.30 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000, respectively). The SDs of high-tech and service-based cities’ emission intensities are relatively small, which are 0.08 and 0.07 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000, respectively.
