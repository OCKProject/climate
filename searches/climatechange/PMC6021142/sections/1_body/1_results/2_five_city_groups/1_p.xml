<p class="p">Recognizing these characteristic differences, we use formal cluster analysis to classify the cities into five distinct groups based on their GDP and industrial output: service-based cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8), high-tech cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 24), energy production cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 32), heavy manufacturing cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 51), and light manufacturing cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 67) (see Materials and Methods). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the geographical distribution of the cities in each group. Most service-based and high-tech cities (blue and green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, respectively) are located in east and south China, with 21 of the 32 gathered into three city clusters (see map insets of Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta). In contrast, the 32 energy production cities (red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) are congregated in west and north China owing to the location of fossil resources (mainly coal) in those regions. The heavy and light manufacturing cities (orange and yellow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, respectively) are more widely dispersed but with a large concentration in central China.
