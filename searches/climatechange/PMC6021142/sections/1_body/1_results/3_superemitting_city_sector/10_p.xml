<p class="p">We then calculate the emission reduction capacities of the five city groups’ pillar industry, under the three scenarios (shown in fig. S3A). Under the strongest scenario, #3, reductions to cities’ pillar industries alone could avoid emissions of 544 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in energy production cities, 388 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in heavy manufacturing cities, 36 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in light manufacturing cities, and 1 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in high-tech cities, or 52, 38, 40, and 11%, respectively, of those cities’ pillar industry emissions. Energy production and heavy manufacturing sectors are the primary emission sources of every city group due to their high emission intensities; therefore, we calculate the emission reduction capacities of the cities’ energy production (fig. S3B) and heavy manufacturing sectors (fig. S3C) as well.
