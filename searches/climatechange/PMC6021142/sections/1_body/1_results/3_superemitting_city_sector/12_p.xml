The emissions reduced under scenario #1 of the energy production, heavy manufacturing, light manufacturing, high-tech manufacturing, and service-based cities are 61 Mt (or 4%), 122 Mt (6%), 242 Mt (13%), 0.3 Mt (0.03%), and 72 Mt (9%), respectively. If scenario #3 technical improvement is applied to cities’ pillar, energy production, and heavy manufacturing industries, then the overall reductions are 2.4 gigatons (Gt) of CO
