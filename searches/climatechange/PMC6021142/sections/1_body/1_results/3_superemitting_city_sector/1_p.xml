<p class="p">Given the strong influence of industrial activities on cities’ CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, we next examine the potential for emission reductions in industrial sectors through scenarios of specific technological improvement. As each city has 39 industrial sectors (5 energy production, 16 heavy manufacturing, 13 light manufacturing, and 5 high-tech industries), there are 7098 industrial city sectors in total. The term “city sector” refers to each industrial sector of each city; for example, thesector “coal mining and dressing” of Beijing is a city sector, while the sector “food processing” of Shanghai is another. We calculate the per–industrial output emissions for the 7098 industrial city sectors. We then identify three levels of superemitters of those city sectors based on the city sectors’ per–industrial output emissions (
