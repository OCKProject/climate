<p class="p">Population and socioeconomic development varies tremendously among these cities: from 0.2 million people living in Jiayuguan (Gansu province, northwest China) to 28.7 in Chongqing (southwest) and from per-capita GDP of just ¥9068 in Fuyang (Anhui province, east) to ¥175,125 in Ordos (Inner Mongolia, north). Similarly, colors in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> indicate that the total CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of the 182 cities range from &lt;15 Mt (yellow) to &gt;90 Mt (dark red; see also table S1). Higher levels of emissions prevail in the north and east, and the top-emitting cities represent a disproportionately large fraction of the total emissions from the 182 cities. The top five emitting cities [Tangshan, Shanghai, Suzhou (the one in Jiangsu province), Nanyang, and Chongqing] accounted for 11% of the total in 2010. In addition, our estimates of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission intensity, calculated as total emissions divided by GDP, range from &lt;0.1 to &gt;1.5 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000, with a minimum of 0.04 and 0.05 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in Shenzhen (Guangdong province, east coast) and Huangshan (Anhui province, east), respectively; a maximum of 1.72 and 1.55 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000 in Hegang (Heilongjiang province, northeast) and Panzhihua (Sichuan province, southwest), respectively; and an average of 0.22 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1,000 (see table S1).
