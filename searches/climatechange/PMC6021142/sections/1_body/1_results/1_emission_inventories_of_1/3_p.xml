<p class="p">The detailed investigation of cities’ emissions by sectors and fuels helps in understanding the wide range in cities’ carbon intensity: cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen, whose emission intensities are just 0.07 and 0.04 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000, respectively, have small manufacturing and energy sectors (20 and 44% of their GDP, respectively) and larger service sectors (75 and 53%, respectively). In contrast, cities such as Maanshan, Tangshan, and Panzhihua have iron and steel production as their “pillar” industries (21, 27, and 31% of their GDP, respectively), with correspondingly high carbon intensities: 0.68, 0.43, and 1.55 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000, respectively. Similarly, in cities where energy production and mining of natural resources are the dominant industries, such as Hegang, emission intensities are especially high (1.72 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per ¥1000) because the activities are emission-intensive, but such cities produce low value-added energy products (such as cleaned coal, coke, and electricity).
