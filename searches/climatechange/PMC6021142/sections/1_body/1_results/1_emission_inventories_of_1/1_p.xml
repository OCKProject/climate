 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the total CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of 182 cities, which are for 2010. Most of the 182 cities are located in the eastern half of the country [that is, under the Aihui-Tengchong line, where more than 90% of China’s population resides (

 </xref>)]. In 2010, the 182 cities emitted 7610 million tons (Mt) of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in total. Industrial sectors make up the largest share of emissions (6639 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or 87% of the cities’ total), especially power and heat production, iron and steel production, and nonmetal minerals (cement, glass, and ceramics). Nonindustrial sectors make up the remaining 12% (971 Mt of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), with two-thirds of emissions from farming and direct energy use in rural areas. The pie charts in fig. S1 (A and B) show the sector mix of 182 cities’ total CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. Figure S1C shows that burning of coal is the source of 74% [especially raw coal (57%) and coke (9%)] of the cities’ total emissions, with oil and natural gas combustion representing just 15 and 2%, respectively, and the remaining 9% from industrial processes such as cement production.
