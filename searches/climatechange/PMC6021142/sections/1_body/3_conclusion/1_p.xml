<p class="p">In order for China to cost-effectively reach its goal of reducing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission intensity by 60 to 65% and running a nationwide Emission Trading Scheme over the next few years, policy-makers in the country need increasingly specific, subnational information about the sources of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the potential reductions and economic implications of different possible policies. By categorizing Chinese cities according to their development stage and industrial makeup, we offer policy-makers an opportunity to meaningfully differentiate across the wide range in city-level CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (from 1.6 to 194 Mt) and emission intensity (from 0.04 to 1.72 metric tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per Â¥1000). Further, because the lower emission intensities of affluent cities (that is, high-tech and service-based cities) are supported by imports from less affluent, industrial, and energy-producing cities located nearby, consumption-based policies may allow more developed cities to subsidize emission reductions without undercutting the economic core of still-developing cities by directly regulating their manufacturing and the electric sectors.
