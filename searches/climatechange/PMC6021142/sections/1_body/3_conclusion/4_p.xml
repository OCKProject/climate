<p class="p">In addition, rapidly growing cities with “new” investments in infrastructure and institutions tend to emulate already-established cities and thereby lock into the “old” development paths. Instead, promoting low-carbon transitions at early stages of industrialization implies careful consideration of “future fit”—how industries can be designed and run to optimize or decouple the relationship between their economic productivity and energy use (or environmental impact). The socioeconomic and environmental characteristics of the 182 cities represent various stages of industrialization, from the preindustrialization stage (for example, energy production cities in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia) to the postindustrialization stage (such as Beijing and Shanghai). In turn, this cross section of Chinese cities we analyze may provide important insights for other developing countries seeking to target superemitting sectors/units in their cities, perhaps enabling them to bypass or abbreviate the most emission-intensive phases of industrialization.</p>
