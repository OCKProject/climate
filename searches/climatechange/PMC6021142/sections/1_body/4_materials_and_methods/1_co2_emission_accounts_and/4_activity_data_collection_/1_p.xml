 </sub>) were collected on the basis of the “energy balance table” and “industrial sectoral energy consumption table” from the city’s statistical yearbook. We collected the energy consumption data of the nonindustrial sectors (that is, farming, service sectors, and household energy use) from the energy balance table. The energy balance table illustrates the energy data of one region, such as production, import, input and output transformation, final consumption, and loss (see table S5). Because of the poor data quality at the city level, only 10% (or 17) of the 182 cities have the energy balance table in their statistical yearbooks. The remaining 90% (or 165) of the cities do not have the table. Considering the completeness and consistency of cities’ emission inventories, we followed our previous study to scale down the corresponding provincial tables to obtain the city-level energy consumption data of these nonindustrial sectors (

 </xref>). We used the GDP for the farming, construction, and service sectors, assuming that the city has the same farming/construction/service energy intensities as its province, and used the urban/rural population for the urban/rural household energy consumption, assuming that the city has the same per-capita residential energy consumption as its province. The data of GDP and population were collected from cities’ and their corresponding provinces’ statistical yearbooks.
