<p class="p">Three approaches are usually used to account for the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of one country: the territorial-based, production-based, and consumption-based approaches. According to the IPCC (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>), the territorial-based emissions are CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emitted within one administrative unit. In the production-approach, not only “emissions from international aviation and shipping are typically allocated to the country of the relevant vessel’s operator” [(
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>), p. 453] but also the “emissions from international tourism are allocated based on where individual tourists are resident, rather than their destination” [(
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>), p. 453]. The consumption-based emissions are calculated according to the final products’ consumption (
