 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. Scope 1 includes emissions from in-boundary fossil fuel combustion, industrial process/product use, wastes, and other in-boundary activities. Scope 2 refers to the in-boundary electricity/heat-related emissions induced by the purchased electricity and heat. Scope 3 includes all the out-of-boundary emissions such as emissions from aviation/marine and imported products/services (

  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). Accordingly, four system boundaries for regional emission accounts are defined on the basis of the three scopes: system boundary 1 is equal to scope 1 emissions; system boundary 2 includes both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions; system boundary 3 is equal to scope 1 plus scope 3 emissions; while system boundary 4 is consumption-based emissions (also called carbon footprint) (
