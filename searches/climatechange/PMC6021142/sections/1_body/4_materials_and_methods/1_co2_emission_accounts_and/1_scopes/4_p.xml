<p class="p">The territorial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of cities in this study included both the fossil fuel–related and process-related emissions. The fossil fuel–related emissions were induced by the fossil fuel combustions. Per the definition of territorial direct CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, the cities’ CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in this study did not include the part induced by imported/purchased electricity and heat. The emissions from the fossil fuel burnt in power plants for electricity/heat generation were allocated to the power and heat sector of the location cities. In addition, we removed the energy used as raw materials during industrial processes (shown as non-energy use in energy statistics) from the total consumption; this part did not emit CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> either (

  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>). The process-related emissions referred to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> that escaped from chemical reaction during the industrial processes (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>), rather than emissions from fossil fuel combustion to gain power, which were accounted as fossil fuel–related emissions. Above all, this study calculated the cities’ IPCC territorial administrative emissions from 17 kinds of fossil fuels (fossil fuel–related; see table S3) and 7 industrial processes (process-related; see table S4).
