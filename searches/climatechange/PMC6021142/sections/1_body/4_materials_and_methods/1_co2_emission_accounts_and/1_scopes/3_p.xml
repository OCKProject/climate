<p class="p">Considering the higher uncertainties and incomparability of the scope 3 emissions, most of the previous studies on city-level emission accounts focus mainly on the scope 1 territorial emissions (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission induced within one country/regionâ€™s administrative boundary. The territorial emissions are usually used for the emission feature analysis and for the reduction policy-making. Territorial emissions are the foundation of the other emission approaches, in that production- and consumption-based emissions are calculated on the basis of territorial emissions.
