 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission accounting based on mass-balance theory. The emissions were estimated as the product of activity data (energy consumption or industrial productions) and the corresponding emission factors. The method is widely used by researchers. On the basis of the IPCC method, the National Development and Reform Commission of China (NDRC) designed an emission account system for Chinese provinces (
