<p class="p">The self-consistent emission accounting framework used in this study provides reference for other developing countries without integrated emission accounts. Despite the quality of emission data having been formally required by the “Paris Agreement,” the capacities of inventorying emissions in developing countries remain insufficient, especially in Asia and Africa. Among the 37 developing countries in Asia, only 17 have relatively high inventorying capacities (
