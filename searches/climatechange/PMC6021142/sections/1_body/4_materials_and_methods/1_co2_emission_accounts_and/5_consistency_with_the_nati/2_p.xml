<p class="p">First, the cities’ CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in this study had the same scope and framework as China’s national and provincial territorial emissions. We included the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from the fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes only. The emissions from the electricity and heat generation (which are non-fossil fuels) were allocated to the power plants, rather than to their final consumption sectors. The scope and framework were consistent with the NDRC guidelines for provincial greenhouse gas inventories, which were widely used in China’s emission accounts and studies (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions were calculated using the IPCC equation, in which the emissions were equal to activity data times by emission factors. We used China’s most up-to-date emission factors to calculate the cities’ emissions (
