<p class="p">The city-level emission inventories in this study were constructed by the territorial scope, IPCC calculation method, and framework that were consistently used in China’s official emission accounts and our previous studies of the national and provincial level. Such consistency makes the multiscale emission inventories comparable. The consistent, transparent, comparable emission inventories at multiscales provide robust data support for China’s emission control and the emission trading scheme.</p>
