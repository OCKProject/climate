<p class="p">The 46 sectors include 1 farming, 1 construction, 3 service sectors, 2 household energy use (urban and rural), and 39 industrial sectors. The 39 industrial sectors can be grouped into four categories: energy production, heavy manufacturing, light manufacturing, and high-tech industries. The energy production category includes five sectors that produce either primary or secondary energy types, while the high-tech category refers to five sectors aiming at high and new technical industries. The remaining 29 sectors belong to manufacturing sectors, including both heavy and light manufacturing sectors. Here, we defined the heavy manufacturing category to include 16 sectors that input energy to produce intermediate products, such as “ferrous metals mining and dressing” and “nonmetal mineral products.” We classified 13 sectors as light manufacturing sectors, which mainly produce final products such as food processing and furniture manufacturing. We allocated the CO
