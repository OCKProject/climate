<p class="p">Third, this study focused on the emission reduction potentials of key industrial sectors only, which may skew the results toward cities with more industry and power generation. We paid less attention to the citiesâ€™ nonindustrial sectors (farming, construction, services, and households) and their emission-saving potentials. This was primarily restricted by the emission data for nonindustrial sectors. Further studies should try to improve estimation of emissions in urban service sectors. We would like to conduct a large survey to measure the differences between emission intensities of service-related sectors across 50+ selected cities in China.</p>
