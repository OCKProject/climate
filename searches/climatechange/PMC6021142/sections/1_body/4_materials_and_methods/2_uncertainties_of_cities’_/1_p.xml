<p class="p">Emission estimates are subject to uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge of activity data and emission factors. Different methods could also result in potential biases in estimates. To more completely assess uncertainties in our city-level emission accounts, we used the Monte Carlo method recommended by IPCC (

 </xref>) and used by previous scholars widely (

  <italic class="italic">50</italic>
 </xref>). The term “uncertainty” in this study refers to the lower and upper bounds of a certain confidence interval (CI) around our central estimate. All of the input parameters of activity data and emission factors, with assumed normal distributions, were placed in a Monte Carlo framework. Twenty thousand simulations were performed to analyze the uncertainty of estimated emissions by sectors. We assumed that both activity data and emission factors were normally distributed. Coefficients of variation (CVs; SD divided by the mean) were collected from literature: The activity data had CVs ranging from 5 to 30% depending on the sector (
