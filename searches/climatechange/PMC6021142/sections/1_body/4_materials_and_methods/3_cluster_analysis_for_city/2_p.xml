<p class="p">Here, we combined the cluster analysis and GDP share method to group the 182 cities. The advantage of cluster analysis is that it groups samples with a set of indicators rather than a single one (

 </xref>) and other interdisciplinary studies (
 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">63</italic>
 </xref>). The basic rationale of cluster analysis is grouping samples with similar attributes. The samples within the groups will be close together geometrically, while the statistical distance between groups will be farther. The statistical distance is measured by distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance.
