<p class="p">In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6B</xref>, the service sectors’ average share in GDP of the service-based cities was significantly higher than those of the energy production, heavy manufacturing, and light manufacturing cities. The service sectors’ average share in GDP of other city groups did not differ significantly. Similar results can be found in the 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> test of energy production sectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref>), light manufacturing sectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>), and high-tech industries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6F</xref>). As for the 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> test of the heavy manufacturing sectors, we found that the sectors’ average share in economic structure was significantly different from those of energy production, light manufacturing, and high-tech cities (at the 0.10 level). Moreover, the sectors’ average share was also significantly different between the energy production and light manufacturing cities.
