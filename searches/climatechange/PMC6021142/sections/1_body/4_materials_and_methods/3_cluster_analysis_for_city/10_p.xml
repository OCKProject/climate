<p class="p">Following the cities’ industrialization process, the most developed high-tech cities will further develop into service-based cities. These service cities may go through every stage of the industrialization process in the past decades, and they have now successfully transferred their pillar industry to service sectors with low emission intensity. They presented sophisticated and practical roadmaps of economic structure optimization and low-carbon development. Therefore, this study extracted these service-based cities from the previous high-tech group to form a new group. Here, the service-based cities were defined as high-tech cities with a higher than 50.63% service sectors’ share in GDP. The 50.63% boundary was calculated as the high-tech cities’ average service sectors’ share in GDP (
