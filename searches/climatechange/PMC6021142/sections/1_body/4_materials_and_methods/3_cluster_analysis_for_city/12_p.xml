 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6A</xref> shows that the emission intensity of energy production cities was significantly higher than that of the light manufacturing, high-tech, and service-based cities at the 0.05 level, while the heavy manufacturing cities had a higher average emission intensity than high-tech and service-based cities. The average emission intensities of light manufacturing, high-tech, and service-based cities did not differ significantly. This was determined by the citiesâ€™ pillar industry and economic structures. Energy production and heavy manufacturing cities had more energy-intensive enterprises. On the contrary, the high-tech and service-based cities relied more on high-tech industries and service sectors. This can be verified in
