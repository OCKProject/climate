<p class="p">(1) We calculated each city’s industrial output share (IO) of the four manufacturing categories: energy production (IO
 <sub class="sub">EP</sub>), heavy manufacturing (IO
 <sub class="sub">HM</sub>), light manufacturing (IO
 <sub class="sub">LM</sub>), and high-tech industry (IO
 <sub class="sub">HT</sub>). Taking Beijing as an example, IO
 <sub class="sub">EP−Beijing</sub> is equal to the energy productions’ industrial outputs divided by Beijing’s total industrial outputs (28%). IO
 <sub class="sub">HM−Beijing</sub>, IO
 <sub class="sub">LM−Beijing</sub>, and IO
 <sub class="sub">HT−Beijing</sub> are 37, 11, and 24, respectively, in 2010. This means 28% of Beijing’s industrial outputs are contributed by energy productions, while 24% are contributed by high-tech industries.
