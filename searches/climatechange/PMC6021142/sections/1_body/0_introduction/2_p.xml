<p class="p">Urbanization is a major driver of economic growth in China, and—as elsewhere—cities produce most (85%) of China’s CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (

  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). For this reason, China’s cities play an increasingly important role in its efforts to reduce CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. For example, the newly launched Emission Trading Scheme in 2017 intends to monitor and control national CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and energy consumption at the city/firm level as part of an emission peak by 2030. Currently, the Emission Trading Scheme covers only the electricity sector owing to data accessibility. The further success of the scheme will depend on accurate sector-level accounts of city emissions, as well as the cooperation of city-level governments where many officials are concerned about the economic impacts of energy and emission constraints. However, in comparison to national and provincial emissions, data to support city-level emission inventories are generally less available and of lower quality.
