<p class="p">We first classify cities into five groups according to their apparent development pathway and then quantify the potential for emission reductions among the city groups under a range of technological scenarios. Our results reveal the extent to which different policies may reduce emissions while in large part maintaining the current industrial structure and energy mix of cities and thereby minimize economic impacts.</p>
