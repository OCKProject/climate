<p class="p">Comprehensive and consistent inventories of city-level emissions based on physical energy flows are thus still badly needed, including disaggregation of fossil fuel types and socioeconomic sectors within cities’ boundaries. Our study provided the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission inventories for 182 Chinese cities by 17 fossil fuels and 46 socioeconomic sectors. We follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) administrative territorial approach, which is compatible and consistent with national and international emission inventories. The 46 sectors are classified according to China’s System of National Accounts (further details in Materials and Methods). The sectors classification can also be mapped with other countries/cities around the world (
