<p class="p">Furthermore, most of the previous studies of city-level emissions provided a single number for total emissions (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>) or, alternatively, included only emissions from selected key sectors. Thus, the sketchy emission accounts of cities cannot support in-depth discussion of city-level emission characteristics and of potential policies for emission reduction. In addition, emission sources reported in different studies are disparate, increasing the uncertainties and discrepancies across studies. For example, Ramaswami 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>) calculated emissions from “buildings and facilities’ energy final consumption, transportation, and embodied energy consumption of key urban materials.” On the other hand, Kennedy 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>) calculated emissions from seven sectors: “electricity, heating and industrial fuels, ground transportation fuels, aviation and marine transportation, industrial processes, product use, and waste.” In contrast, Wang 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>) calculated city-level emissions from “industries, transportation, household energy use, commerce, industrial processes, and waste.”
