<p class="p">Yet, each of these previous studies assessed emissions using different methods, scopes, and primary data (see Materials and Methods for details), generating inconsistent results and preventing meaningful comparisons across studies. For example, Parshall 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">17</italic>
 </xref>) and Markolf 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>) only estimated the scope 1 emissions, whereas Ramaswami 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>) included both direct and indirect emissions and Ramaswami 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>) estimated the scope 1 + scope 2 emissions for cities. The scope 1 emissions refer to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emitted during energy combustion or other human activities within a city boundary, while the scope 2 emissions included CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> induced by imported electricity/heat generation. Mi 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>) calculated the consumption-based (scope 3) emissions of 13 Chinese cities using an input-output method. The consumption-based emissions quantify the emissions embodied in the consumption of final products.
