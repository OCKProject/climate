<p class="p">Because of these data limitations, previous studies have focused on megacities in developed countries for which energy data were consistent and systematic, particularly cities in the United States. For example, Ramaswami 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>) developed a hybrid life cycle–based methodology for conducting city-scale greenhouse gas inventories, and their subsequent studies (

  <italic class="italic">4</italic>

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>) estimated the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of Florence, Italy, based on carbon flux observations. Later, attempts were also made to estimate the city-level emissions in some developing countries. D’Almeida Martins and da Costa Ferreira (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>) analyzed emissions of two Brazil megacities: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Ali and Nitivattananon (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>) discussed the emissions from the city of Lahore (in Pakistan) from 1971 to 2010.
