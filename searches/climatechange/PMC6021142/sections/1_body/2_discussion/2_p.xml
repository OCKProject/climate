<p class="p">Although it would be costly and disruptive for energy production– and heavy industry–based cities to reorganize their industrial structure in the short term (for example, by closing or relocating emission-intensive industries), more affluent, service-based cities might be able to quickly outsource their more emission-intensive industries without economic hardship. However, such outsourcing by highly developed cities could increase overall emissions; by virtue of their level of development, these cities often have more advanced technologies in place, and outsourcing would thus tend to move carbon-intensive, heavy-polluting industries to less-developed regions with less-efficient technologies. For example, Shougang Corporation, one of the largest steelmaking companies in China, has moved progressively from Beijing to Hebei province (mainly to Tangshan) since 2010. Beijing’s CO

 </xref>), and Shougang Corporation is one of the main causes of the increase. Whereas the emission intensity of iron and steel production in Beijing was 1.4 metric tons of CO
