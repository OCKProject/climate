<p class="p">On the basis of detailed analysis of cities and their industries, our findings suggest that Chinaâ€™s near-term goals of reducing its emission intensity may be feasibly accomplished by targeted technological improvements, buying time for the longer-term strategies of shifting to non-fossil energy and a more service-based economy. Moreover, improving and optimizing the energy and carbon efficiency of industrial production processes and operations could help lower the costs of advanced technologies and thus facilitate their deployment in less-developed cities and countries beyond China.</p>
