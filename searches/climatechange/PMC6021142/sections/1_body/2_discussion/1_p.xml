<p class="p">Updating and improving technologies might reduce emissions while leaving the industrial structure of individual cities (and thus their respective roles in the existing Chinese economy) unchanged. This is critical, given the rapidity of targeted reductions; the central government in China seeks to reduce national CO

If the percentage reductions of scenario #3 in 2010 (31%) are assumed to still be available in 2014, then China’s emission intensity in 2014 could be 48.25% lower than the 2005 level (the real emission intensity in 2014 is 25% lower than the 2005 level). This would allow China to meet its 60 to 65% commitments easier. Other options for meeting these goals, such as radical industrial restructuring or large-scale shifts in the country’s energy mix (

For example, policies that simply shut down energy-intensive industries would immediately and seriously affect the economies of energy production and heavy industry cities, as well as the more developed high-tech and service-based cities that depend on them.
