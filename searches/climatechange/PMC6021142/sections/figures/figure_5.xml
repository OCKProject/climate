  <p class="p">Potential reductions in CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (in million tons) are shown for each of the five city groups where the emission intensities of 2 SD, 1 SD, and above-average superemitters are brought down to the sector mean intensity (scenarios #1, #2, and #3, respectively). The numbers on top of each scenario bar represent the potential reductions in CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions under the scenarios compared with the baseline. The magnitude of reductions under scenario #1 is greatest in the light manufacturing cities, while the energy production cities have the largest reduction magnitude under scenario #3. The overall reductions under scenario #3 are 2.4 Gt of CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, or 31% of the citiesâ€™ emissions in 2010.
