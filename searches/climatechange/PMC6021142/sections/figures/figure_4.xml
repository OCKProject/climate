  <title class="title">City sectors ranked by per-industrial output emissions.</title>
  <p class="p">Emission-Lorenz curve of 7098 industrial city sectors (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) and top/bottom 10 city sectors in per–industrial output emission (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>). The numbers alongside the 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis in (B) and (C) are the per–industrial output emissions of the city sectors. The numbers in parentheses after the city name denote the sectors of the cities, which are consistent with the sectors’ ID number in table S2. The colors of the bars indicate the city sectors’ categories (red, energy production; orange, heavy manufacturing; yellow, light manufacturing; green, high-tech industry). For example, Shangqiu (20) in (B) refers to the “petroleum processing and coking” sector of Shangqiu and belongs to energy production (red); Beijing (34) in (C) refers to the “electronic and telecommunications equipment” sector of Beijing and belongs to the high-tech industry (green).
