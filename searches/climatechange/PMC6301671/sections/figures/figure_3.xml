  <title class="title">Projected wildfire trends by MC2 and a randomly selected cSTSM simulation iteration.</title>
  <p class="p">Differences in wildfire projections between MC2 and cSTSMs largely reflect distinct model assumptions about wildfire. Specifically, MC2 is deterministic in setting burn probabilities/events, whereas the stochastic nature of cSTSMs results in fewer wildfire opportunities (even with a slightly increasing trend in area burned with time under changing climate).</p>
