<p class="p">Here we present MC2 and cSTSM region-wide trends for forest zones and wildfire. We also present cSTSM results for two key structural stages: early- and late-seral conditions, which support exceptional diversity for threatened species of concern [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Early-seral states included all grass/forb and post-disturbance conditions. We defined late-seral conditions as areas with average quadratic mean diameters &gt; ~51 cm, multi-storied (&gt;1 canopy layer), and with moderate to high canopy cover (&gt;40%).
