<p class="p">While our climate change transitions capture the average probability of a vegetation shift between 2010 and 2100, these averages could mask inter-annual variability of vegetation movement when the climate is more or less conducive to vegetation change. Like other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], we therefore developed inter-annual multipliers, or trend multipliers, to account for changes in the magnitude of vegetation movement with time. For a given climate scenario and forest zone transition, the previously calculated time-series data of annual proportion was divided by the average transition probability to normalize the data and develop the trend multipliers. Inter-annual multipliers &lt;1 decreased the climate change probability for a given year while multipliers &gt;1 increase the probability of shifting to a different forest zone. We used a similar approach to develop MC2-derived inter-annual wildfire multipliers where we examined how much area burned in a given year, relative to the average for 2010–2100 (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] for method details). Through this approach, a coincidence of both wildfire and a large vegetation change multiplier would be needed to greatly increase the likelihood of vegetation change—a high vegetation trend value without fire prohibited change (i.e., inertia).
