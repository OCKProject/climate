<p class="p">We selected eight previously-developed STSMs representing all forest types in Washington State that were also modeled by MC2. Prior to this analysis, an STSM assigned to a given location in our study area remained fixed through time even with changes in climate. An earlier effort, resulting in methods used in this analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], developed an approach to identify STSM-to-STSM climate change transitions informed by MC2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209490.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), thereby enabling area to move across STSMs with climate changes. We refer to these climatically linked STSMs as cSTSMs. While MC2 can generate spatial output, our approach relies on tallying information from individual pixels in the study area to generate regional tabular vegetation and wildfire data (Step 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209490.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Because our STSMs are non-spatial, we used this tabular information to develop two sets of region-wide STSM values: 1) average climate change transition probabilities of vegetation shifts, and 2) random sequences of inter-annual climate trends in vegetation shifts and wildfire.
