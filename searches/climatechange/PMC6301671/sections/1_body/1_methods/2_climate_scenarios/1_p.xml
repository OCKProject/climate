<p class="p">We used the 2010 version of the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] for historical climate data [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] to calibrate the MC2 DGVM. This historical dataset is available on a 30-arcsec grid (~800m) and spans the years 1895â€“2009. For future climate projections, we obtained a subset of global circulation model (GCM) output prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report under representative concentration pathway 8.5, a scenario representing comparatively high greenhouse gas concentrations in absence of climate change mitigation policies [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. We selected three GCMs for our analysis: CSIRO_MK360 RCP 8.5, HadGEM2_ES RCP 8.5, and NORESM1 RCP 8.5, hereafter referred to as CSIRO, HadGEM, and NorESM, respectively. We selected this subset of GCMs because they demonstrate relatively lower bias in the Pacific Northwest [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and also span a range of future climate conditions in terms of average annual precipitation and temperature (
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Seasonally, projected temperature increases are greater in the summer than winter while precipitation increases in winter and decreases during the summer months. The monthly values of four climate variables generated by each GCM were statistically downscaled to a 30-arcsec grid (~800) using the delta method [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. These four variables were: precipitation, the monthly means of diurnal extreme temperatures, and a measure of atmospheric water content. The downscaled variables were used as input into a DGVM.
