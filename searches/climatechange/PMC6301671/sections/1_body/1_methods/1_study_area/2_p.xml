<p class="p">Outside of the Puget Lowlands and Olympic Mountain rain shadow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), fire was historically infrequent and large patches of stand-replacing fire were a major component of the fire regime (although most fires may be considered mixed-severity at the scale of the entire fire footprint). Fire rotations typically vary from 200 years in the highest elevation subalpine forests, to over 1,000 years along the Washington coast [

 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], but historically experienced mixed-severity wildfire which also included more low severity wildfire than occurred in the rest of the study region. Across all of western Washington, we estimate the average natural fire rotation to be approximately 500 years based on forest zone area and average fire rotation values from the literature [
