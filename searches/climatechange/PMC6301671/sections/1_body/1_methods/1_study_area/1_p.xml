<p class="p">The study region covers approximately 5.26 million ha of forest west of the Cascade Mountain Crest in Washington State, USA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209490.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Elevation in the region ranges from sea level to 4392 m at the peak of Mount Rainier in the Cascade Mountains. The temperate maritime climate of western Washington is characterized by annual precipitation ranging from 500 to 5,000 mm. Coastal areas receive 3,000 to 5,000 mm of precipitation per year, while the crest of the Olympic Mountains receives &gt;6,000 mm of precipitation per year, making it the wettest location in the conterminous United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In contrast, the northeastern portion of the Olympic Peninsula in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains and portions of the Puget Lowlands, are characterized by a drier climate, with rainfall as low as 500 mm per year at lower elevations [
