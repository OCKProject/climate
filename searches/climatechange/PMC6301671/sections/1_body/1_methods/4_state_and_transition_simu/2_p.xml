<p class="p">STSMs can be run both spatially and non-spatially [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. We ran our models non-spatially, partly because there is a dearth of information on stand-replacing wildfire patch-size distributions due to the rarity of the disturbance, and partly because we sought to assess only broad-scale regional trends in forest vegetation. Wildfire was consequently a non-contagion event, where disturbance occurrence depends on probabilistic ‘rolls of the dice’. But as further discussed below, the probability of wildfire could be annually increased or decreased for a given climate future depending on MC2 wildfire projections.
