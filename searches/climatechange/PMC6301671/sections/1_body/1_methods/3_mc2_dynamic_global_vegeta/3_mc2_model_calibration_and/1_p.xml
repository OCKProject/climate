<p class="p">Western Washington was divided into three regions for MC2 calibration based on Level III Ecoregion boundaries [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], which represent a combination of biotic, abiotic, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem components more similar to each other than to other ecoregions. Simulations for each ecoregion were run independently. Once historical vegetation was determined from the forest zone model for each region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209490.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>), we assigned pre-European historical fire rotations to each forest zone (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209490.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref> for fire rotation values). These historical wildfire values were derived from the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and are also the values used as wildfire probabilities in our STSMs (described later). The historical values do not incorporate fire suppression effects, and we did not include fire suppression in future MC2 projections.
