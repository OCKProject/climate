<p class="p">In this study we replaced the MC2 biogeography ruleset for projecting a coarse-scale plant lifeform classification with species distribution models (SDMs), resulting in output of finer vegetation groups often used by land managers. Specifically, we adapted results from gradient modeling conducted by [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] to have MC2 classify grid cells into potential natural vegetation zones, hereafter referred to as forest zones. Henderson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] defined forest zones as the plant community or the set of communities capable of occupying a location absent disturbance or management. Eight input data layers were used to develop the forest zone model: aspect, cold air drainage, elevation, fog effect, mean air temperature at sea level, precipitation at sea level, shortwave radiation, and topographic moisture. By regressing thousands of field observation data on these eight data layers, [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] developed SDMs, identifying occupied environmental niches for different forest zones. The eight environmental variables were available as 90-m grids, but we aggregated them to 800 m to match the resolution of the climate input grids. Mean annual temperature at sea level and precipitation at sea level were calculated annually within MC2 from elevation and annual temperature and precipitation data provided by each GCM. We then applied ecoregion-specific regression equations developed by [
