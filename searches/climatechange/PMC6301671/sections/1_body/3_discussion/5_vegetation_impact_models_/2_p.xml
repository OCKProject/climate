<p class="p">A possibility for future research is the incorporation of the regeneration niche into MC2. The regression equations developed by [

Assuming the regeneration envelope of a species is narrower than that of a mature tree, incorporating information on individual speciesâ€™ regeneration niche into MC2 would provide a different picture of future potential vegetation. For example, it might be possible to incorporate the rulesets used in the regeneration niche model TACA [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] into MC2, thereby examining the probability of individual species regeneration within a forest zone under different climate projections. This information could also help managers begin to identify if, when, and how current seed stock and seedlings might need to change given different climate futures.
