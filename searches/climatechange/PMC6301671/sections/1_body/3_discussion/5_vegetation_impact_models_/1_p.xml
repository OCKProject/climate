<p class="p">Several types of dynamic vegetation models, such as LPJ [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] and BIOME [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], utilize the “climate envelope” concept, where vegetation only exists within its climate tolerance [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. These envelopes are usually determined from current species distributions [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], and are thus limited by available data. Similarly, the envelopes in our models are limited by data. For example, in the case of the largest predicted change in climate of 6°C and plus or minus 10 percent in precipitation, there is no place in North America with a westerly flow of maritime air into a mountain range which could be called a surrogate for validating such predicted future vegetation. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] also found precipitation and fog effect to have a stronger influence in modeling vegetation distribution and response in the gradient model than temperature and cold air drainage. Ecologically, the relative influence of both variables suggests many trees in the region are relatively insensitive to changes in temperature, but sensitive to changes in precipitation or soil moisture. However, no long-term trend in precipitation is projected for the region (but seasonal precipitation changes are expected) [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Although the GCMs were in part selected to encompass a range of temperature and precipitation futures, it is possible a different selection of GCMs would have resulted in different MC2 projections given gradient model and plant species sensitivities to precipitation.
