<p class="p">Lastly, evidence is lacking in the role of surface and mixed-severity fires in the study region, where fire regimes are nominally ‘stand-replacing’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>].Consequently, all forest zone STSMs, other than the Douglas-fir forest zone, only include stand-replacing wildfire transitions. We recognize this is an over-simplification of wildfire regimes in western Washington (as most fire events span all severities at a coarse scale). However, evidence suggests non-stand-replacing fire becomes more common south of Washington [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] and both low- and mixed severity fire are not generally considered to reset succession in these systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Our vegetation zone and late-seral projections would therefore remain unchanged even if non-stand-replacing wildfire transitions were included in all cSTSMs.
