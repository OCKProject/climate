<p class="p">Though the climatic changes we assessed may not result in dramatic shifts in total area of many vegetation zone in western Washington, shifts in species composition within these zones are possible, particularly following a stand-replacing disturbance (absent subsequent planting). Douglas-fir, with higher drought tolerance and fire resistance than many co-occurring species such as western hemlock and western redcedar [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], will likely become more dominant at lower elevations, as illustrated by the expansion of the Douglas-fir zone in the MC2 and cSTSM simulations, particularly in the Puget Lowlands and northeastern (rain shadow) portion of the Olympic Peninsula. This trend is consistent with other analyses. For example, [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], using LANDIS-II, found increasing temperatures and decreasing summer precipitation may impede the typical seral transition from Douglas-fir to western hemlock in the Puget Lowlands. The expansion of Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine at mid- to low elevations in the dry northeastern portion of the Olympic Peninsula was projected by [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] using a gap model (ZELIG). Paleoecological records also support the potential for future expansion of these species. During the warm and dry Holocene period circa 10,000–6,000 BP, red alder, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine were abundant in forests of primarily western hemlock and spruce at lower elevations on the Olympic Peninsula [

 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The abundance of these species in the Pacific Northwest has been associated with higher fire frequency [

 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. However, severe moisture limitations may stress or eliminate even relatively drought-tolerant species like Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine from the driest sites [
