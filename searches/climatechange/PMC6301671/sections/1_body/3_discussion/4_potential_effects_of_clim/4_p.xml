<p class="p">Broadly, while the forests of western Washington have low fire resistance, these forests have been highly resilient to stand-replacing wildfires in the past [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], meaning they could historically experience a severe fire without shifting to an alternative ecosystem state over the long-term (adapted from [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]). With a future increase in area burned, we would continue to expect low resistance (which can be enhanced via fire suppression) but lower resilience than in the past at some point. When that climatic threshold in resilience will be crossed is uncertain, and whether or not we continue to suppress fires, the changes are likely to be abrupt and extensive due to the nature of wildfire in these systems [
