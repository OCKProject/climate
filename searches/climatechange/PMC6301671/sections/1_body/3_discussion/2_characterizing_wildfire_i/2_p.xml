<p class="p">Both our MC2 and cSTSM wildfire projections without fire suppression are within the ~160–1170% range projected in other studies using the MC model across western Washington and Oregon [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Incorporating fire suppression, our cSTSM fire projections results tended to be outside, or span, the lower ranges from other studies (an increase of 110–210%). The ecological significance of these projected changes in fire vary with assumptions about future fire suppression. A reduction in the fire rotation to an average of 83 years, as projected by MC2 without fire suppression, would drastically change the sustainability of the myriad values currently associated with western Washington forests. Conversely, shortening rotations from 417 years (across all forest zones) to an average of 250 years in our cSTSMs, assuming fire suppression and landscape inertia, has fewer socio-ecological consequences.
