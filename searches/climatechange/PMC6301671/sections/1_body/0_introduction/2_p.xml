<p class="p">A key example of a high-inertia forest landscape occurs in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Like much of western North America, this region is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including higher temperatures [

 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]), decreased growing season precipitation (by as much as 30% by late century; [
