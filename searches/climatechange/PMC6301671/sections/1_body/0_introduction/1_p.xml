 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], opportunities for such shifts are potentially greater under higher disturbance frequencies, which could provide more opportunities for the climatically-sensitive regeneration phase to interact with changing environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, these opportunities may be less frequent in forests with infrequent disturbance regimes where disturbance intervals tend to be measured in centuries rather than decades (e.g., maritime and subalpine temperate conifer forests [

 <sup class="sup">5</sup> ha) are relatively common and within normal system behavior. Such forests can be described as having greater ‘landscape inertia’ because of longer disturbance-free periods, fewer broad-scale regeneration opportunities, and long-lived tree species that, in mature form, can tolerate suboptimal conditions for long time periods [
