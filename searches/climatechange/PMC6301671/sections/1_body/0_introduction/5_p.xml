 <xref rid="pone.0209490.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], we utilized a model approach to examine the potential influence of wildfire and landscape inertia on climate-related vegetation changes in an infrequently disturbed forest region. The methodology we used allows the 
 <italic class="italic">potential</italic> distribution of vegetation zones to change incrementally with climate, but only allows 
 <italic class="italic">actual</italic> shifts to occur following a severe disturbance (i.e., when landscape inertia is broken). Further, the approach alters fire occurrence from a deterministic (DGVM) to a more realistic stochastic process (STSMs). Consequently, there was always a probability that wildfire may not occur in a given parcel or year, potentially resulting in fewer opportunities for wildfires to catalyze vegetation change. Through the lens of landscape inertia, our specific objectives were to characterize:
