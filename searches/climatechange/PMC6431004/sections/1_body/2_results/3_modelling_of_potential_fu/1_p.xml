<p id="Par24" class="p">Areas with suitable climatic conditions for 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> in Australia have been predicted to decrease by 2050 and even further by 2070 under all four RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Currently, 959,040.82 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> in Australia. However, in 2050 the suitable area reduced in all four scenarios, ranging between 548,751.36–680,130.58 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, leaving 54.45–68.61% of the area in common with the current model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). By the 2070s, the area of suitability declined even further in all four models with 386,233.19–717,111.65 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic>, leaving 27.82–70.26% of the area in common with the current model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The contracted areas are found in the current northern parts of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> range where the geometric centre of the species range shifted 397.14 km south along the east coast by the 2050s (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This southward shift is observed to be a further 127.47 km by the 2070s (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
