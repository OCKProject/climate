 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The best Maxent model included a fine scale with the following four environmental variables: maximum temperature of warmest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter and precipitation of warmest quarter (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>: Figure S1). The best model was determined by interpreting AUC values, variable importance functions and the correlation matrix (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The AUC for Clade ‘Sydney’, Clade ‘Darwin’, Clade ‘Cairns’ and all haplotypes were 0.96, 0.99, 1.0 and 0.98, respectively. The variable importance function identified that the maximum temperature of warmest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter and precipitation of warmest quarter variables had an importance of 10%, 40%, 25% and 25%, respectively, in the model. The correlation matrix showed that precipitation of wettest quarter and precipitation of warmest quarter are highly correlated (0.5) whereas all other variables are uncorrelated with each other.
