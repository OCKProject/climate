 <italic class="italic">Ctenocephalides felis</italic> (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae), commonly known as the cat flea, is the most common flea found on companion animals in Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ctenocephalides felis</italic> has a cosmopolitan distribution and is highly tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. As 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> imposes health risks to humans and domestic animals as a biological vector, it is important to understand and predict both current and future suitable habitats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Climatic variables play an integral part in the life-cycle of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> and consequently have an effect on their distribution, as they will only reside and successfully reproduce within limited climatic ranges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. As a result, it is essential that we understand the effects of climate on 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> distribution, both now and in the future.
