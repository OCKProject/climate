<p id="Par14" class="p">The aim of this study is to model if 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> distribution in Australia will be affected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios. To address this aim, we evaluated the genetic diversity of the cat flea by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the 
 <italic class="italic">cox</italic>1 mtDNA region. The predictive Maxent modelling was then used to determine the current and future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> haplotypes in Australia using IPCC climate change scenarios.
