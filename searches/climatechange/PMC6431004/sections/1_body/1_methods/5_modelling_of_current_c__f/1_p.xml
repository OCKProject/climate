 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>] was used to model the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> in Australia. A total of 179 samples were used, which included samples obtained in this study, unpublished data and published data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>: Table S4). Latitude and longitude coordinates for each sample were entered into Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL) (BCCVL, Griffith University) as biological data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. “Australia, Current Climate (1976–2005), 30 arcsec (~1 km)” climate and environmental data was selected from the datasets available in the BCCVL collections. All variables were initially included in the model, while only the variables with the highest probability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> presence in response to ecogeographical variables were included in the final model as they reported the greatest amount of the observed variation. The chosen response variables were required to be within the environmental thresholds for 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> survival. Namely, temperatures between 3–35 °C with 70–95% humidity and high precipitation levels (&gt; 500 mm yearly) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were assessed, where the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting model. A model with an AUC score of 0.5 or below indicated that the model performed no better than random. Models with an AUC score of 1 indicated a perfect model. Additionally, the variable importance function was used to calculate the correlation score between the standard prediction and the new prediction, giving an estimation (%) of the importance of that variable in the model. The higher the value of the variable, the more influential it was in the model. The correlation matrix was used to complement the variable importance function where it showed the probability of predictor variables to be correlated to ensure that the included variables are not highly correlated and produce a bias output in the model. It is important to note that there are limitations involved in strictly using AUC models, and they should be used in conjunction with other model evaluation methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Therefore, we used the variable importance function and correlation matrix with the AUC scores to determine the model of best-fit for the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic>.
