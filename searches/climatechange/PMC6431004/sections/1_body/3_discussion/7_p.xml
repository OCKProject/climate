<p id="Par32" class="p">As climate is a fundamental driver in shaping species diversification, climate change can lead to a range shift or reduction in habitat suitability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Under all RCP climatic scenarios, a southward shift in the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> was observed to occur along the coastal areas of Australia by the 2050s and continuing further by the 2070s (range shift = 124.11 km per decade). Although the proximate expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> into new suitable regions continues by extensive movement of their hosts, our findings predict an ultimate decline of 61.43% in suitable climatic habitat by the 2070s under the RCP8.5 model. The decrease in suitable habitat further north is most likely due to a predicted increase in the maximum temperature of the warmest month. An increase in temperature can increase the rate of development for arthropods; however, the positive association between temperature and developmental rate may be offset by the species total bioclimatic requirement for survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Initially, the increased temperatures may promote the spread and occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> along the north-eastern coastline, but the expected temperature increase of 1.1–6.4 °C from 1980 to 2099 will exceed critical threshold temperatures (35 °C) for 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> survival in the current northern areas of habitat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. As a result, the climatic requirements for the growth and development of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> will become limited in these areas and consequently restrict the distribution of the parasite to areas further south with sufficient bioclimatic resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Climate change in the future is also expected to increase precipitation and humidity levels in some areas while other areas will experience severe drought conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. It is known that flea infestations are mostly absent in the Australian inland communities as drought conditions are too harsh for flea survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. As 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> development and survival is highly dependent on moist environments, distribution is most likely to be found in those regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. As moist regions are becoming further restricted to coastlines in the future, the model suggests that there will be an increase in flea populations in these areas.
