<p id="Par26" class="p">This study has doubled the number of fleas genotyped in Australia and provided an updated perspective on the diversity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic>, particularly in the north-eastern region. Only three 
 <italic class="italic">cox</italic>1 haplotypes have previously been reported from 47 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> specimens collected from domestic cats and dogs across Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. This study confirms the presence of the haplotypes (h1, h4 and h5) previously genotyped, and uncovers the existence of three new 
 <italic class="italic">cox</italic>1 haplotypes (h2, h3 and h6) in north-eastern Australia. These results provide strong evidence supporting intra-specific diversification of 
 <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> between the north-eastern region and middle to southern regions of Australia. As haplotypes h4, h5 and h6 have only been detected in this tropical region and differ genetically by one SNP, they have been categorised as Clade ‘Cairns’, whilst genetically similar haplotypes h1 and h2 have been found elsewhere have been grouped as Clade ‘Sydney’.
