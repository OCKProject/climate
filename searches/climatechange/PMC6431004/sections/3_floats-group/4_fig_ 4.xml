  <p class="p">Comparison of climate change models of 
   <italic class="italic">Ctenocephalides felis</italic> Clade ‘Sydney’ for 2050 and 2070 in Australia. In 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), Clade ‘Sydney’ is predicted to reduce its presence in all scenarios. Overall, Clade ‘Sydney’ is predicted to be restricted even closer to the coastline as the inner regions become too warm and dry for flea survival. There is a small expansion predicted for the Blue Mountains range west of Sydney, New South Wales. Orange areas indicate a contraction from the current range, blue areas indicate no change in range and green areas indicate an expansion of the current range. The species distribution models were analysed further using a Maxent climate change model for predicted future distribution of 
   <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> Clade ‘Sydney’ in Australia. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) were evaluated with WorldClim data and 10 arcmin resolution
