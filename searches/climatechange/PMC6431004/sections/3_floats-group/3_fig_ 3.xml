  <p class="p">Comparison of climate change models of all 
   <italic class="italic">Ctenocephalides felis</italic> haplotypes for 2050 and 2070 in Australia. In 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), the distribution of 
   <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> in Australia is predicted to shift south along the east coast. The range is predicted to be restricted even closer to the coast as the inner regions of Australia become too warm and dry for flea survival. Orange areas indicate a contraction from the current range, blue areas indicate no change in range and green areas indicate an expansion of the current range. The species distribution models were analysed further using a Maxent climate change model for predicted future distribution of 
   <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> in Australia. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) were evaluated with WorldClim data and 10 arcmin resolution
