  <p class="p">Comparison of climate change models of 
   <italic class="italic">Ctenocephalides felis</italic> Clade ‘Cairnsʼ for 2050 and 2070 in Australia. In 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), Clade ‘Cairns’ is predicted to be further restricted to the eastern coastline of Australia as the inner regions become too warm and dry for flea survival and predicted to make their way south along the east coast. Orange areas indicate a contraction from the current range, blue areas indicate no change in range and green areas indicate an expansion of the current range. The species distribution models were analysed further using a Maxent climate change model for predicted future distribution of 
   <italic class="italic">C. felis</italic> Clade ‘Cairns’ in Australia. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2070 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) were evaluated with WorldClim data and 10 arcmin resolution
