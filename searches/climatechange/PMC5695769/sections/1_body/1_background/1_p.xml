<p class="p">Energy consumptions in the residential and commercial sectors are driven by complex interactions between socio-economic conditions, available technologies, land-use patterns, characteristics of the built environment, policy landscapes and climatic conditions of a given region. There exists a large body of literature on modeling energy demand in the residential and commercial sectors as a function of a wide range of factors such as climate, policy, technology, and socio-economic conditions [

However, since the objective of this paper is assessing the climate sensitivity of end-use demand, we focused our literature review on the studies that included climate variability and change as a key parameter in analyzing residential and commercial demand patterns.
