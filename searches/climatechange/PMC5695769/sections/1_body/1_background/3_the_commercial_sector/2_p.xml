They concluded that the U.S. commercial buildings are 'over-cooled' and quantified the associated economic costs. Blum and Sathye [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] analyzed the non-governmental, and non-mall commercial buildings in the U.S. to examine whether a market failure due to principal-agent (PA) problem might have prevented the installation of energy-efficient devices, or efficient operation of space-conditioning equipment. The study identified PA market failures for smaller buildings (i.e., area less than 50,000 sq. ft.) in the case of space heating and market failures for all building types in the case of space cooling.
