 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] developed energy benchmarking models—based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)—for office buildings in all census regions of the U.S. The ANN models outperformed linear regression in terms of both goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy. Their analysis focused on model's predictive performance and no statistical inferences were discussed in their paper. The Department of Energy also conducted a benchmarking study based on energy usage intensity (EUI) to make recommendations based on principal building activity [

Similarly, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories published recommendations based on (non-statistical) inferences from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Surveys (CBECS 2003) dataset to suggest HVAC systems for buildings based on their principal activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] assessed the feasibility of achieving net zero-emissions in commercial buildings. The authors discussed the concept of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) potential, using the ‘EnergyPlus’ simulation package. Their results indicated that 22%–64% of buildings could potentially reach ZEB by 2005–2025.
