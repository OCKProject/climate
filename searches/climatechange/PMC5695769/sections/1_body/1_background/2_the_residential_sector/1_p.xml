 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] developed a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)—using the cross-sectional Residential Energy Consumption Surveys (RECS) data in 2001—to examine the interactions between occupants’ behavior, building systems and climatic characteristics. Their objective was to examine the roles of occupant behavior (particularly in terms of space conditioning) and socio-economic factors in shaping energy demand curves. They fitted separate models for space heating and space cooling. Their results suggested that heating-degree-days (HDD) was the most significant predictor for space heating. In the case of space cooling, behavioral variables (e.g., extent of air-conditioning) were identified to be important. They also concluded that physical characteristics of buildings influenced the residents’ heating load more than their cooling load. Yun and Steemers analyzed the residential cooling load [

They assessed the relative significance of behavioral, physical and socio-economic parameters on cooling demand in order to provide a better understanding of their complex interactions, and to enable a more informed appraisal of interventions or incentives to improve energy efficiency. A few studies analyzed the role of ownership versus renting in shaping the climate-sensitive end-use demand. For instance, Levinson and Neimann [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] conducted a study to understand the energy consumption behavior of tenants residing in utility-included apartments by analyzing the EIA RECS data and the American Housing Survey (AHS) data (1985–1997). They hypothesized that tenants in utility-included apartments were less incentivized to conserve energy. Indeed, they found that tenants in utility-included apartments were inclined to set their thermostats 1–3°F higher during winters when they are away; contributing to 0.75% increase in fuel expenditures. The authors concluded that landlords were inclined to favor utility-included rent contracts. This is because, the property-owners could invest in energy efficient appliances (to reduce demand curves) while charging higher rents in exchange for paying utility bills upfront. Davis [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] leveraged the RECS 2005 dataset in order to investigate if renters were less likely to have energy efficient appliances. The study found significant variation in household energy use across different population groups, mainly due to economic factors and household characteristics. Min [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] developed a linear regression model using RECS 2005 data and U.S. Census Bureau 2000 zip-code-level data to predict energy used for space heating, water heating, cooling and appliances. Cities and suburban areas were found to have higher natural gas consumption compared to rural areas. They concluded that the total energy use was dominated by heating, with California ranking the lowest and some states in the Midwest and Northeast ranking the highest in heating energy demand. Kaza [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] trained a quantile regression model to the EIA RECS (2005) data to examine the relationship between energy consumption and various factors such as, heating and cooling degree days, total heating and cooling area, household size, price of electricity, housing type and age, neighborhood density, ownership and income. The study identified the age of the house as a more important predictor for heating rather than cooling. Total area was found to be positively related to household energy use, while neighborhood density did not seem to have a significant impact on energy demand. Moreover, cooling load was found to be inelastic with respect to the price of electricity. Howard [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] developed a multiple regression model to estimate demand intensity (Kilowatt-hour per square-meters of floor area, i.e., KWh/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in the built environment in New York City. They developed eight different models for various building types, but did not provide much information about the predictive performance of their models.
