<p class="p">To address these knowledge gaps, we developed a multi-paradigm framework to characterize the climate sensitivity of end-use demand. More specifically, we developed a Bayesian, non-parametric data-miner to characterize the state-level energy demandâ€“climate nexus in the residential and commercial sectors. The aggregate demand estimates were then mapped onto statistically representative individual user units (i.e., house-hold level in the residential sector, and building level in the commercial sector). Downscaled climate change scenarios were then used to project future end-use demand for space cooling, space heating and water heating at the individual household and building levels. Our model outputs can easily be integrated into energy-economy models such as MARKAL to enable accounting for climate variability and change while projecting the medium- and long-term energy demand under various policy scenarios.</p>
