<p class="p">Our analysis concluded that under both climate change scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the energy consumption for an ‘average’ household in IN is projected to 
 <underline class="underline">decrease</underline> by 3.5% by 2100 due to less heating requirement during warmer winters. Moreover, by 2100, the energy demand for an ‘average’ commercial building is projected to 
 <underline class="underline">increase</underline> by 5.1% and 5.4% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively (compared to the historical consumption over 1981–2013). The projected increase is due to the commercial sector’s greater use of cooling energy, relative to the residential sector, and higher projected daytime temperatures.
