<p class="p">Reliable access to energy is critical for proper functioning of the modern society. Integrated resource adequacy planning in the energy sector hinges on the capability to accurately project the future trends in energy demand. However, projecting long-term trends in energy demand is an increasingly complex endeavor due to the uncertain emerging changes in climate, policy, regulatory environment, economy and technology among other factors. There exist many powerful energy-economy models that can be leveraged to project the long-term demand trends in the energy sector under various future scenarios related to technology and policy trends. However, majority of the existing energy-economy tools (e.g., MARKAL) are not able to exogenously account for climate variability and change. In this paper, we proposed a multi-paradigm framework to help extend the energy-economy models to be able to account for climate change. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed framework, we used the state of Indiana as a case study. We trained and rigorously validated a Bayesian, non-parametric predictive model with historical data on end-use energy demand and climatic conditions in Indiana to characterize the energy demand-climate nexus. We then used downscaled climate scenarios to project future demands under the two climate scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Finally, we harnessed detailed information on the energy used for space cooling, space heating and water heating in the residential and commercial sectors, to generate sampling distributions for these categories of end-use demand to transform the aggregate state-level estimates into individual household- and building-levels. The probabilistic estimates of end-use demand (with associated credible and prediction intervals) under each scenario could then be fed into MARKAL or other similar energy planning tools to facilitate accounting for climate variability and change.</p>
