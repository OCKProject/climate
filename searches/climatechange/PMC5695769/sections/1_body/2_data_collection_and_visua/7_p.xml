To extract the seasonal signals in climate data, we followed a three-step procedure: (i) aggregated the station-averaged daily data to monthly-level data using the monthly medians; (ii) classified the weather variables into three seasonal categories of summer (June–September), winter (December–March) and intermediate (April, May, October, November), to be consistent with the seasonal classifications in the commonly used EIA energy-economy models, such as MARKAL (
