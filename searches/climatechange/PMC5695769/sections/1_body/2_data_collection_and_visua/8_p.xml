<p class="p">In our previous research, we identified dew point temperature, average wind speed, and precipitation levels as the key predictors of the climate sensitive portion of the end-use demand [

 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, since projections of downscaled dew-point temperature were unavailable, we used minimum and maximum temperature as proxies for the dew point temperature. This is reasonable as minimum temperature (TMIN) represents the lower range of the dew point temperature, while the maximum temperature (TMAX) captures the higher range of the dew point temperature [
