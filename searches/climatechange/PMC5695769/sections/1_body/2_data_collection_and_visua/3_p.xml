 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> provides the residential sector’s descriptive statistics on (i) historical net energy consumption during 1981–2013 from the SEDS dataset, and (ii) the fractions of climate sensitive end-use energy demands (i.e., space heating and cooling and water heating) extracted from the most recent version of the EIA RECS (2009) dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. EIA RECS data contains granular information on a ‘statistically representative’ sample of households in the states of Indiana and Ohio. In the RECS dataset, states with lower population levels and similar energy consumption profiles are combined and therefore data exclusive to the state of Indiana is not available. However, since the states of Indiana and Ohio are quite similar in terms of their demographics and energy profiles, the implications of using such data in our analysis will likely be minimal.
