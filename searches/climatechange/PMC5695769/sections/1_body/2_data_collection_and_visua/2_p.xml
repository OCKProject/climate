<p class="p">The state-level annual net end-use energy demand data for the residential and commercial sectors were obtained from the U.S. EIA State Energy Data System (SEDS) for the period of 1963–2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This yearly sectoral energy demand accounts for only the net energy consumption, excluding the electrical system energy losses. More specifically, the net energy demand represents aggregated consumption of coal, petroleum, natural gas, electricity (including energy losses during transmission), biomass, geothermal and solar energy use in a year and is expressed in trillion Btu (British thermal units) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. It is noteworthy that we only included data post 1980’s to exclude the tipping point effects of the oil and energy crises in the 70’s [

The fractions of different categories of end-use energy (i.e., space heating, space-cooling and water heating) were obtained from the EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)-2009 and Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) datasets-2012 [
