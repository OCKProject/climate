 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. RCPs, represent a large set of scenarios in the literature and characterize possible development trajectories for the key forcing agents of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. More specifically, we used the two scenarios, namely, RCP 8.5 (characterized by high greenhouse concentration levels) and RCP 4.5 (representing a more stabilized scenario). Due to the coarse spatial resolution of the climate scenarios, they were downscaled to the State of Indiana using the hybrid-delta technique [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g004" class="xref">4</xref> show the distribution of historical and projected input climate variables under the two scenarios. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>, that while there seems to be a modest upward trend in the average value of precipitation, the tail of its probability density function becomes much heavier under RCP 8.5; indicating an increased likelihood of experiencing extremes under the high emission scenario. Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>, there is little evidence that the distribution of wind speed will statistically change in the future.
