<p class="p">From the 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> above, we can observe that the greatest fraction of the energy demand in Indiana is attributed to space heating and water heating. Space cooling accounts for a very small fraction of the total statewide energy consumption. More specifically, on average, 73.1% of total energy is consumed for space heating, 25.2% is used for water heating and about 1.7% is needed for space cooling.
