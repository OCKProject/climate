 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> provides the commercial sector’s descriptive statistics on (i) historical net energy consumption during 1981–2013 from the SEDS dataset, and (ii) fractions of climate sensitive end-use energy demand obtained from a statistically representative sample of commercial buildings in the East North Central region available at EIA CBECS-2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Unfortunately, granular data at individual state-level is not available. The assumption here is that the commercial end-use energy profile for Indiana is similar to that of the entire East North Central region of the U.S.
