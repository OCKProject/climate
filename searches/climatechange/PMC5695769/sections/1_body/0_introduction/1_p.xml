<p class="p">The U.S. energy infrastructure is capital intensive and requires significant investments in the planning and operation of the systems to ensure supply adequacy under a range of future contingencies. The ability to accurately predict and project future energy demand lies at the heart of sustainable and resilient planning and operation of the energy sector. This is because demand predictions drive supply expansion planning. It is to be noted that in this paper, we use the term ‘prediction’ to refer to short–and medium–term forecasts that rely on historical data, and ‘projection’ for longer–term forecasts that are contingent on scenarios used in the model. Inaccurate estimation of demand renders over- or under-investment in capacity expansion planning, which could lead to either rapid depletion of natural resources or large-scale supply shortages [

Energy demand forecasts are generally classified based on their lead-time windows of: (i) short-term (hourly, daily, weekly or monthly), (ii) medium-term (monthly to 1 to 5 year(s)), and (iii) long-term (5 to over 30 years of lead time). While short-term forecasts are key for reliable daily operations and medium-term forecasts are critical for supporting regulatory decisions related to rate-setting, long-term projections are important for identifying optimal investment strategies in capacity expansion decisions [

Each category of short, medium, and long-term forecast has its own unique challenges in terms of data availability, methodology, computational resources, types of stakeholders involved, and regulatory requirements. However, long-term energy projection is most complex due to the epistemic uncertainties about the future shifts in policy, technology, socio-economic conditions and climatic change. There exist many sophisticated energy-economy models for projecting medium- and long-term trends in the energy infrastructure such as MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) [

 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. While these models can account for factors such as the future changes in technology, socio-economic conditions, and policy impacts, they are not able to adequately incorporate uncertainties associated with shifts in end-use energy demand due to climate variability and change [
