<p class="p">In this paper, we propose a data-driven, multi-paradigm methodology to characterize the complex energy demandâ€“climate nexus in the residential and commercial sectors for various end-uses such as space cooling, space heating and water heating. Our proposed framework can be easily integrated with the existing energy-economy models (e.g., MARKAL) to account for climate sensitivity of the long-term end-use demands. While we selected the state of Indiana as a case study, our proposed approach can be readily extended to any other region in the United States. We selected Indiana due to a number of reasons detailed below:</p>
