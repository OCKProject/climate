<p class="p">As discussed in the Methodology section, we obtained the projections for the end-use energy demand by multiplying the projected aggregate sectoral energy demand by the generated probability distributions of space heating, space cooling and water heating fractions of the respective sectors. The estimated changes in these categories of end-use energy demands under different scenarios are shown in Tables

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t006" class="xref">6</xref>. These final estimates can then be easily integrated in the existing energy-economy models as discussed before.
