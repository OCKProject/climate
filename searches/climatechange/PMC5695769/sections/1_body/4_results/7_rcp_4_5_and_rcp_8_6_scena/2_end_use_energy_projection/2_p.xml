<p class="p">It should be noted that the results summarized in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t005" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t006" class="xref">6</xref> are contingent on the assumption that the future distributions of end-use energy demand will resemble that of the past. However, in the presence of disruptive technologies that could shift the consumption patterns, our proposed framework is still applicable; in that case, the generated empirical distributions of the fractions of end-use consumptions will have to be updated. Moreover, we would like to highlight that in this paper, we projected the average end-use demand for a ‘statistically representative’ user (i.e., an 
 <italic class="italic">individual household</italic> or an 
 <italic class="italic">individual commercial building</italic>). The implication here is that our results characterize the climate sensitivity of end-use energy demands for an average ‘representative’ household in the state, which does not imply that all households will have similar energy demand curves. For instance, while based on our projected estimates, the average household heating energy in the year of 2050 will be around 200±15 Btu, the distribution of household heating energy load in Indiana could be as low as 20 Btu in a mobile home in rural Indiana to possibly up to 500 Btu in a mansion located in the wealthy Hamilton County. Moreover, it should also be stressed that since our estimates are reported on a per-household/building basis, our results are not sensitive to future population variations in the state. It is noteworthy that projected energy demand in the residential sector does not vary much under the two climate change scenarios. We hypothesize two major reasons for this outcome. First, due to the lack of availability of the statistically downscaled projection of the state-level mean dew point temperature, our model considered only the minimum and maximum temperatures which are inadequate indicators of the heat stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Moreover, our previous research showed that mean dew point temperature is a better predictor of the climate sensitive end-use demand as compared to the other climate variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Thus, with the inclusion of the mean dew point temperature in the model, we might be able to notice significant differences in the residential energy demand under the two climate change scenarios. Second, the projected wind speed data was not statistically downscaled as it showed statistically insignificant differences from the historical distributions. However, since wind speed was found to be an important predictor for the residential energy demand, availability of accurate wind speed projections might have an influence on the residential demand projections under the two scenarios.
