<p class="p">Unlike the residential sector, in the commercial sector, space cooling and space heating account for similar fractions of end-use energy demand; with the historical amounts ranging in 19.4–31.1 trillion Btu and 18.7–30.0 trillion Btu, respectively. The least amount of energy is consumed for water heating—historical demand ranging between 6.4–10.3 trillion Btu. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g013" class="xref">Fig 13B</xref> that the demand in the commercial sector will be on-average substantially higher than the historical average values under both emission scenarios. More specifically, under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the average demand will be around 179.9 trillion Btu—a 5.1% increase than the historical median and it could range between 147.8–214.1 trillion Btu. Similarly, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the projected median commercial demand will be 180.5 trillion Btu—a 5.4% increase from the historical median (
