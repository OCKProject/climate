<p class="p">The median values as well as upper and lower confidence bounds associated with the aggregated state-level energy demand in the residential and commercial sectors under the two scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g013" class="xref">Fig 13A and 13B</xref>. The first columns in the figures are associated with historical demand (1980–2013) and the second and third columns show the projections all the way to 2100 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively. Under RCP 4.5, the median residential demand is projected to be 278.5 trillion Btu—a 3.5% decrease from the historical median (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>)—and can vary in the range of 243.7–323.2 trillion Btu. Under RCP 8.5 the median residential demand is projected to be 278.7 trillion Btu—a 3.5% decrease from the historical median—and could range between 243.0–276.9 trillion Btu. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g013" class="xref">Fig 13A</xref> reveals that the future energy demand will be lower under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) for the residential sector. This is not surprising since, in the residential sector in IN, the highest fraction of energy is used for space heating (historical demands ranging from 187.6–230.3 trillion Btu), followed by water heating (in the range of 64.7–79.4 trillion Btu). Least amount of energy is used for space cooling (historical demand ranging between 4.4–5.4 trillion Btu). Higher temperatures will, therefore, lead to reduced demand in the residential sector.
