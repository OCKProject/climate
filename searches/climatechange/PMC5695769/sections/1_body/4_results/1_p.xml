<p class="p">The performance of our predictive models developed to characterize the energy demand–climate nexus for the residential and commercial sectors in Indiana are summarized in Tables

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t004" class="xref">4</xref>. To benchmark the performance of our predictive models, we also provided information about the ‘null’ or ‘mean-only’ models. Comparison with the ‘null model’ reveals the extent of the predictive model’s contribution to explaining the variance of the response, beyond its historical mean [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> that the predictive model—based on the BART algorithm—for the residential sector offers a 26% improvement in out-of-sample RMSE, and 32% in terms of out-of-sample MAE compared to the “mean-only” alternative. Moreover, the in-sample improvements (in terms of RMSE and MAE) associated with the BART-model over the null-model are much more significant (
