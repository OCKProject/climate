 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref> depicts the normal quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of the residuals for (a) the residential, and (b) the commercial sectors. Since all the points lie along the 45° line of the normal quantile plots—and within the 95% confidence intervals (red dotted lines)—it can be concluded that the residuals are normally distributed. This indicates that the developed models for both sectors have adequately characterized the variability in the response variable. The normally distributed residuals, with an expected value of zero, represent the inherent stochasticity associated with the response variable that is independent of the input variables (refer to Eq (
