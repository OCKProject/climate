<p class="p">Since our predictive model is non-parametric, we leveraged variable importance bar-charts as well as partial dependence plots to make statistical inferences. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref> shows the bar-chart of variable importance rankings for the residential sector. The variable ranking is based on ‘variable inclusion proportion’ which indicates the fraction of times a given predictor was used in constructing a decision-tree in the ensemble model. The bar-chart also includes uncertainty bounds, showing the variation in inclusion proportion across all decision trees used in the BART ensemble model. It can be observed that the temperature-related variables during the winter months (i.e., TMIN.W and TMAX.W) are ranked highest in terms of importance. This is expected, since the largest fraction of the energy consumption in the residential sector in Indiana is attributed to space heating (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The variable ‘year’ shows up as a key predictor which is expected because it captures the secular trends in energy consumption data. Maximum temperature during warmer months (summer and intermediate seasons), and wind speeds during the intermediate months (April-May and October-November) are also identified as important predictors. Precipitation patterns appear to rank lower than temperature and wind-related variables in the residential sector. To understand the relationship between each of these key climatic variables and energy demand, partial dependencies were plotted (
