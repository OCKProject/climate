<p class="p">It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g010" class="xref">Fig 10A, 10C and 10E</xref> that the minimum and maximum temperatures during the winter (i.e., during December-March), and maximum temperature in intermediate months (i.e., April-May, and October-November) are negatively associated with energy demand. This is expected because higher temperatures during the colder months result in reduced demand for space heating. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g010" class="xref">Fig 10B</xref> shows that the energy consumption in the residential sector in the state of Indiana increased steadily during 1980–2000. The consumption levels plateaued during the years 2000–2005, and then started to follow a downward trend after mid-2000’s. The downward trend since mid-2000’s can be attributed to several energy efficiency initiatives. such as, the ‘Energizing Indiana’ program that contained comprehensive energy-efficiency programs for Indiana home-owners.
