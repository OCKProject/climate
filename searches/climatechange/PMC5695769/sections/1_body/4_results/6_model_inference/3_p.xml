<p class="p">Wind-speed during the intermediate season is positively associated with residential end-use demand. Referring to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, it shows that wind speeds during the fall (i.e., months of October and November) are comparatively stronger than the other seasons in the state of Indiana, which can cause cooling effects, thereby increasing demand for space heating and water heating. While maximum temperature during the summer is also an important predictor, its impact on the residential energy demand is comparatively attenuated. The attenuated effect is largely attributable to the fact that only a small fraction of energy is used for space cooling in the state of Indiana.
