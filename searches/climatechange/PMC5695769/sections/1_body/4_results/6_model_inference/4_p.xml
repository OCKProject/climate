<p class="p">The variable rankings in the commercial sector is different from that of the residential sector (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref>). For instance, unlike the residential sector, variable ‘year’ is identified as a considerably more important predictor of energy demand compared to all other climatic variables. This is as expected since a healthy and growing economy will boost commercial activities, thereby, increasing the demand. Moreover, in contrary to the residential sector, commercial buildings are often centrally owned and managed. Therefore, the climate sensitive portion of the commercial demand patterns is expected to be different from the residential sector’s, where the behavior is much more sensitive to the environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Out of the climate variables, it can be noticed that wind speed, precipitation levels and minimum temperatures during the winter months, together with temperatures during the summer and intermediate seasons rank as the most important predictors of the climate sensitive portion of the commercial energy demand.
