Like the residential sector, the variable ‘year’ is positively associated with energy demand until early 2000’s, after which the energy demand plateaus, largely due to the energy conservation and efficiency initiatives such as ‘Energizing Indiana’ that contained comprehensive energy-saving programs for offices and businesses in IN. Higher winter precipitations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g012" class="xref">Fig 12B</xref>) are associated with higher energy demand, since more energy is needed for space heating and water heating due to the precipitation-induced colder environments. Demand (for heating) will be higher when the wind speeds are higher than 3.7 meters per second (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g012" class="xref">Fig 12D</xref>) during the intermediate seasons are associated with lower energy demand, as this indicates a comfortable temperature requiring lower levels of space heating or space cooling. Energy demand (for heating) is reduced as the minimum (negative) temperatures rise in the winter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g012" class="xref">Fig 12E</xref>). The minimum temperatures in the summer in the state of IN can still be quite low (in the range of 14–16°C) and higher (minimum) temperatures are also associated with reduced demand.
