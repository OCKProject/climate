<p class="p">Similarly, it can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, that the BART-predictive model for the commercial sector offers a significant improvement over the ‘mean-only’ model. More specifically, the BART model’s out-of-sample accuracy is 23% higher in terms of RMSE, and 17% in terms of MAE. Similar to the results for the residential sector, our predictive model for the commercial sector outperforms the null-model in terms of in-sample errors even by a greater margin.
