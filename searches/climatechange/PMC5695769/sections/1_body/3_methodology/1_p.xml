 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> below summarizes our multi-paradigm framework for projecting the residential and commercial end-use energy demands into the future (until 2100) under the various climate change scenarios. We refer to our approach as a “multi-paradigm” framework because it integrates different types of modeling techniques, such as, simulation, machine learning and hybrid downscaling on the same platform to obtain our final outcomes.
