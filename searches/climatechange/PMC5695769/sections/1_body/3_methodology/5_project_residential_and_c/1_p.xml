<p class="p">To project the climate sensitive portion of end-use demand under a future climate scenario, the Bayesian predictive models for the residential and commercial sectors were trained separately with the downscaled climate data associated with that scenario. It should be noted that our Bayesian predictive models estimated the median values of end-use demand together with uncertainty intervals i.e., Bayesian credible intervals and prediction intervals. Bayesian credible interval characterizes the uncertainty, given the posterior distribution of the response variable [

The annual projections for each sector were then multiplied by the generated empirical distributions of the end-use demand for space heating, space cooling and water heating (outlined in step 2 above). The probabilistic estimates of the end-use demand for space heating, space cooling and water heating for the residential and commercial sectors can be used as inputs in the most commonly used energy-economy models, to allow for accounting the impacts of climate variability and change under different scenarios.
