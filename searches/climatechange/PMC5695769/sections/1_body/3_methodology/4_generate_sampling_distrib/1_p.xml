 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Since the empirical distributions of end-use demand for space heating, space cooling, and water heating were found to be heavy-tailed, we used the generalization of the central limit theorem [

 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] to generate sampling distributions of the end-use demand proportions in each sector. To map the aggregate estimates of state-level demand onto the individual household-level/building-level estimates, we multiplied the aggregate demand by the generated probability density functions of the end-use demand proportions for space heating, space cooling and water heating. The implicit assumption here is that the distributions of these three types of end-use energy consumption will not significantly change over time. This assumption may be invalid in the face of major technological or behavioral shifts in the future. In the presence of strong evidence for certain structural shifts in technology or behavior, the generated sampling distributions of end-use demand can be updated—based on the empirical data or expert knowledge—to reflect such information.
