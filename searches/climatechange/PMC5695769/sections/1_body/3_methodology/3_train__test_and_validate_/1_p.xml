 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] were used to develop Bayesian predictive models for each sector. To harmonize the temporal scale of our climate data with the seasonal scale, typically used in most energy-economy models (such as MARKAL [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and NEMS [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]), we aggregated the climate data over the three seasons of summer (June–September), winter (December–March) and intermediate (April, May, October, November). In training our predictive models, we included the variable “year” in addition to the (climatic) predictors (discussed in the data section) to control for the (non-climatic) secular trends.
