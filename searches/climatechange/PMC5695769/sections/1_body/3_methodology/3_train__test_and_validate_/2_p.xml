 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], we leveraged the method of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] to develop our predictive models. Our prior research found BART as a particularly powerful algorithm for modeling the energy demand–climate nexus due to its: 1) superior predictive performance, 2) ability to yield fully probabilistic prediction and credible interval uncertainty estimation, and 3) ability to incorporate expert knowledge into the learning procedure [

 <xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. We conducted a thorough cross-validation process in training, testing and validating our energy forecasting models. More specifically, we used a 20% randomized holdout analysis to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models and simulated the process for 30 times—as a conservative measure to ensure that all data has been used at least once. The expected values of MSE (Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) were used to estimate the out-of-sample prediction accuracy for the models developed for each sector.
