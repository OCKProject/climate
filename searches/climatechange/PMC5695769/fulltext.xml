The existing energy-economy paradigms used to characterize the long-term trends in the energy sector do not adequately account for climate variability and change. In this paper, we propose a multi-paradigm framework for estimating the climate sensitivity of end-use energy demand that can easily be integrated with the existing energy-economy models. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed framework, we used the energy demand and climate data in the state of Indiana to train a Bayesian predictive model. We then leveraged the end-use demand trends as well as downscaled future climate scenarios to generate probabilistic estimates of the future end-use demand for space cooling, space heating and water heating, at the individual household and building level, in the residential and commercial sectors. Our results indicated that the residential load is much more sensitive to climate variability and change than the commercial load. Moreover, since the largest fraction of the residential energy demand in Indiana is attributed to heating, future warming scenarios could lead to reduced end-use demand due to lower space heating and water heating needs. In the commercial sector, the overall energy demand is expected to increase under the future warming scenarios. This is because the increased cooling load during hotter summer months will likely outpace the reduced heating load during the more temperate winter months.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Purdue EEE-SER seed grant</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nateghi</surname><given-names>Roshanak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF SEES #1555582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nateghi</surname><given-names>Roshanak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided by Purdue EEE-SER seed grant, and the NSF SEES #1555582, entitled &#x0201c;Sustainable Energy Infrastructure Planning&#x0201d;.

The ability to accurately predict and project future energy demand lies at the heart of sustainable and resilient planning and operation of the energy sector. This is because demand predictions drive supply expansion planning. It is to be noted that in this paper, we use the term &#x02018;prediction&#x02019; to refer to short&#x02013;and medium&#x02013;term forecasts that rely on historical data, and &#x02018;projection&#x02019; for longer&#x02013;term forecasts that are contingent on scenarios used in the model. Inaccurate estimation of demand renders over- or under-investment in capacity expansion planning, which could lead to either rapid depletion of natural resources or large-scale supply shortages [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Energy demand forecasts are generally classified based on their lead-time windows of: (i) short-term (hourly, daily, weekly or monthly), (ii) medium-term (monthly to 1 to 5 year(s)), and (iii) long-term (5 to over 30 years of lead time). While short-term forecasts are key for reliable daily operations and medium-term forecasts are critical for supporting regulatory decisions related to rate-setting, long-term projections are important for identifying optimal investment strategies in capacity expansion decisions [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Each category of short, medium, and long-term forecast has its own unique challenges in terms of data availability, methodology, computational resources, types of stakeholders involved, and regulatory requirements. However, long-term energy projection is most complex due to the epistemic uncertainties about the future shifts in policy, technology, socio-economic conditions and climatic change. There exist many sophisticated energy-economy models for projecting medium- and long-term trends in the energy infrastructure such as MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and NEMS (National Energy Modeling System) [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While these models can account for factors such as the future changes in technology, socio-economic conditions, and policy impacts, they are not able to adequately incorporate uncertainties associated with shifts in end-use energy demand due to climate variability and change [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we propose a data-driven, multi-paradigm methodology to characterize the complex energy demand&#x02013;climate nexus in the residential and commercial sectors for various end-uses such as space cooling, space heating and water heating. Our proposed framework can be easily integrated with the existing energy-economy models (e.g., MARKAL) to account for climate sensitivity of the long-term end-use demands. While we selected the state of Indiana as a case study, our proposed approach can be readily extended to any other region in the United States. We selected Indiana due to a number of reasons detailed below:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Indiana is the 9<sup>th</sup> most energy intensive state (on a per capita basis) in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>Being an importer of electricity from the neighboring states and Canada, Indiana is vulnerable to supply shortages in cases of shifts in demand due to reasons such as climate variability and change [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>The state of Indiana ranks 2<sup>nd</sup> in terms of coal consumption in the energy sector.

In general, the state experiences the interplay of polar air moving south from Canada and warm, moist air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico, which cause sudden variations in the climatic conditions, leading to complex patterns of energy demand for space conditioning [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>Previous research has shown that unlike the transportation and industrial sectors, the residential and commercial sectors are most sensitive to climatic variability and change [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We therefore limited the scope of our analyses to the residential and commercial sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Background</title><p>Energy consumptions in the residential and commercial sectors are driven by complex interactions between socio-economic conditions, available technologies, land-use patterns, characteristics of the built environment, policy landscapes and climatic conditions of a given region. There exists a large body of literature on modeling energy demand in the residential and commercial sectors as a function of a wide range of factors such as climate, policy, technology, and socio-economic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, since the objective of this paper is assessing the climate sensitivity of end-use demand, we focused our literature review on the studies that included climate variability and change as a key parameter in analyzing residential and commercial demand patterns.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>The residential sector</title><p>Steemers and Yun [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] developed a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)&#x02014;using the cross-sectional Residential Energy Consumption Surveys (RECS) data in 2001&#x02014;to examine the interactions between occupants&#x02019; behavior, building systems and climatic characteristics. Their objective was to examine the roles of occupant behavior (particularly in terms of space conditioning) and socio-economic factors in shaping energy demand curves. They fitted separate models for space heating and space cooling. Their results suggested that heating-degree-days (HDD) was the most significant predictor for space heating. In the case of space cooling, behavioral variables (e.g., extent of air-conditioning) were identified to be important. They also concluded that physical characteristics of buildings influenced the residents&#x02019; heating load more than their cooling load. Yun and Steemers analyzed the residential cooling load [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They assessed the relative significance of behavioral, physical and socio-economic parameters on cooling demand in order to provide a better understanding of their complex interactions, and to enable a more informed appraisal of interventions or incentives to improve energy efficiency. A few studies analyzed the role of ownership versus renting in shaping the climate-sensitive end-use demand. For instance, Levinson and Neimann [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted a study to understand the energy consumption behavior of tenants residing in utility-included apartments by analyzing the EIA RECS data and the American Housing Survey (AHS) data (1985&#x02013;1997). They hypothesized that tenants in utility-included apartments were less incentivized to conserve energy. Indeed, they found that tenants in utility-included apartments were inclined to set their thermostats 1&#x02013;3&#x000b0;F higher during winters when they are away; contributing to 0.75% increase in fuel expenditures. The authors concluded that landlords were inclined to favor utility-included rent contracts. This is because, the property-owners could invest in energy efficient appliances (to reduce demand curves) while charging higher rents in exchange for paying utility bills upfront. Davis [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] leveraged the RECS 2005 dataset in order to investigate if renters were less likely to have energy efficient appliances. The study found significant variation in household energy use across different population groups, mainly due to economic factors and household characteristics. Min [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] developed a linear regression model using RECS 2005 data and U.S. Census Bureau 2000 zip-code-level data to predict energy used for space heating, water heating, cooling and appliances. Cities and suburban areas were found to have higher natural gas consumption compared to rural areas. They concluded that the total energy use was dominated by heating, with California ranking the lowest and some states in the Midwest and Northeast ranking the highest in heating energy demand. Kaza [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] trained a quantile regression model to the EIA RECS (2005) data to examine the relationship between energy consumption and various factors such as, heating and cooling degree days, total heating and cooling area, household size, price of electricity, housing type and age, neighborhood density, ownership and income. The study identified the age of the house as a more important predictor for heating rather than cooling. Total area was found to be positively related to household energy use, while neighborhood density did not seem to have a significant impact on energy demand. Moreover, cooling load was found to be inelastic with respect to the price of electricity. Howard [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] developed a multiple regression model to estimate demand intensity (Kilowatt-hour per square-meters of floor area, i.e., KWh/m<sup>2</sup>) in the built environment in New York City. They developed eight different models for various building types, but did not provide much information about the predictive performance of their models.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The commercial sector</title><p>Yalcintas [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] developed energy benchmarking models&#x02014;based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)&#x02014;for office buildings in all census regions of the U.S. The ANN models outperformed linear regression in terms of both goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy. Their analysis focused on model's predictive performance and no statistical inferences were discussed in their paper. The Department of Energy also conducted a benchmarking study based on energy usage intensity (EUI) to make recommendations based on principal building activity [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories published recommendations based on (non-statistical) inferences from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Surveys (CBECS 2003) dataset to suggest HVAC systems for buildings based on their principal activity [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another study [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] assessed the feasibility of achieving net zero-emissions in commercial buildings. The authors discussed the concept of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) potential, using the &#x02018;EnergyPlus&#x02019; simulation package. Their results indicated that 22%&#x02013;64% of buildings could potentially reach ZEB by 2005&#x02013;2025.</p><p>Derrible and Reeder [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] used the Department of Energy's eQuest v3.65 package to simulate the energy consumption in the U.S. commercial buildings. They concluded that the U.S. commercial buildings are 'over-cooled' and quantified the associated economic costs. Blum and Sathye [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] analyzed the non-governmental, and non-mall commercial buildings in the U.S. to examine whether a market failure due to principal-agent (PA) problem might have prevented the installation of energy-efficient devices, or efficient operation of space-conditioning equipment. The study identified PA market failures for smaller buildings (i.e., area less than 50,000 sq. ft.) in the case of space heating and market failures for all building types in the case of space cooling.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Existing gaps and our contribution</title><p>While reviewing the significant developments in the area of energy demand&#x02013;climate nexus (outlined above), we have identified a number of knowledge gaps in the field, some of which are summarized below.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Majority of the statistics-based approaches used for modeling the residential sector&#x02019;s demand, leverage linear models to characterize the energy demand&#x02013;climate nexus.

This is because, cross-sectional data lack information on temporal variability.

The bar-chart also includes uncertainty bounds, showing the variation in inclusion proportion across all decision trees used in the BART ensemble model. It can be observed that the temperature-related variables during the winter months (i.e., TMIN.W and TMAX.W) are ranked highest in terms of importance. This is expected, since the largest fraction of the energy consumption in the residential sector in Indiana is attributed to space heating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t001">Table 1</xref>). The variable &#x02018;year&#x02019; shows up as a key predictor which is expected because it captures the secular trends in energy consumption data.

This is expected because higher temperatures during the colder months result in reduced demand for space heating. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g010">Fig 10B</xref> shows that the energy consumption in the residential sector in the state of Indiana increased steadily during 1980&#x02013;2000. The consumption levels plateaued during the years 2000&#x02013;2005, and then started to follow a downward trend after mid-2000&#x02019;s. The downward trend since mid-2000&#x02019;s can be attributed to several energy efficiency initiatives. such as, the &#x02018;Energizing Indiana&#x02019; program that contained comprehensive energy-efficiency programs for Indiana home-owners.</p><p>Wind-speed during the intermediate season is positively associated with residential end-use demand.

While maximum temperature during the summer is also an important predictor, its impact on the residential energy demand is comparatively attenuated. The attenuated effect is largely attributable to the fact that only a small fraction of energy is used for space cooling in the state of Indiana.</p><p>The variable rankings in the commercial sector is different from that of the residential sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g011">Fig 11</xref>). For instance, unlike the residential sector, variable &#x02018;year&#x02019; is identified as a considerably more important predictor of energy demand compared to all other climatic variables. This is as expected since a healthy and growing economy will boost commercial activities, thereby, increasing the demand. Moreover, in contrary to the residential sector, commercial buildings are often centrally owned and managed. Therefore, the climate sensitive portion of the commercial demand patterns is expected to be different from the residential sector&#x02019;s, where the behavior is much more sensitive to the environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Higher winter precipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g012">Fig 12B</xref>) are associated with higher energy demand, since more energy is needed for space heating and water heating due to the precipitation-induced colder environments. Demand (for heating) will be higher when the wind speeds are higher than 3.7 meters per second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188033.g012">Fig 12C</xref>); accounting largely for the wind-chill effects during the months of December and January.

Higher temperatures will, therefore, lead to reduced demand in the residential sector.</p><fig id="pone.0188033.g013" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0188033.g013</object-id><label>Fig 13</label><caption><p>Dot-plot showing the scenario-based comparison of the total energy consumption for (a) the residential sector, and (b) the commercial sector.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0188033.g013"/></fig><p>Unlike the residential sector, in the commercial sector, space cooling and space heating account for similar fractions of end-use energy demand; with the historical amounts ranging in 19.4&#x02013;31.1 trillion Btu and 18.7&#x02013;30.0 trillion Btu, respectively.

ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188033.t006">6</xref> are contingent on the assumption that the future distributions of end-use energy demand will resemble that of the past. However, in the presence of disruptive technologies that could shift the consumption patterns, our proposed framework is still applicable; in that case, the generated empirical distributions of the fractions of end-use consumptions will have to be updated. Moreover, we would like to highlight that in this paper, we projected the average end-use demand for a &#x02018;statistically representative&#x02019; user (i.e., an <italic>individual household</italic> or an <italic>individual commercial building</italic>). The implication here is that our results characterize the climate sensitivity of end-use energy demands for an average &#x02018;representative&#x02019; household in the state, which does not imply that all households will have similar energy demand curves. For instance, while based on our projected estimates, the average household heating energy in the year of 2050 will be around 200&#x000b1;15 Btu, the distribution of household heating energy load in Indiana could be as low as 20 Btu in a mobile home in rural Indiana to possibly up to 500 Btu in a mansion located in the wealthy Hamilton County. Moreover, it should also be stressed that since our estimates are reported on a per-household/building basis, our results are not sensitive to future population variations in the state. It is noteworthy that projected energy demand in the residential sector does not vary much under the two climate change scenarios. We hypothesize two major reasons for this outcome. First, due to the lack of availability of the statistically downscaled projection of the state-level mean dew point temperature, our model considered only the minimum and maximum temperatures which are inadequate indicators of the heat stress [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, our previous research showed that mean dew point temperature is a better predictor of the climate sensitive end-use demand as compared to the other climate variables [<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, with the inclusion of the mean dew point temperature in the model, we might be able to notice significant differences in the residential energy demand under the two climate change scenarios. Second, the projected wind speed data was not statistically downscaled as it showed statistically insignificant differences from the historical distributions. However, since wind speed was found to be an important predictor for the residential energy demand, availability of accurate wind speed projections might have an influence on the residential demand projections under the two scenarios.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Reliable access to energy is critical for proper functioning of the modern society. Integrated resource adequacy planning in the energy sector hinges on the capability to accurately project the future trends in energy demand. However, projecting long-term trends in energy demand is an increasingly complex endeavor due to the uncertain emerging changes in climate, policy, regulatory environment, economy and technology among other factors. There exist many powerful energy-economy models that can be leveraged to project the long-term demand trends in the energy sector under various future scenarios related to technology and policy trends. However, majority of the existing energy-economy tools (e.g., MARKAL) are not able to exogenously account for climate variability and change. In this paper, we proposed a multi-paradigm framework to help extend the energy-economy models to be able to account for climate change. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed framework, we used the state of Indiana as a case study. We trained and rigorously validated a Bayesian, non-parametric predictive model with historical data on end-use energy demand and climatic conditions in Indiana to characterize the energy demand-climate nexus. We then used downscaled climate scenarios to project future demands under the two climate scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Finally, we harnessed detailed information on the energy used for space cooling, space heating and water heating in the residential and commercial sectors, to generate sampling distributions for these categories of end-use demand to transform the aggregate state-level estimates into individual household- and building-levels. The probabilistic estimates of end-use demand (with associated credible and prediction intervals) under each scenario could then be fed into MARKAL or other similar energy planning tools to facilitate accounting for climate variability and change.</p><p>Our analysis concluded that under both climate change scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the energy consumption for an &#x02018;average&#x02019; household in IN is projected to <underline>decrease</underline> by 3.5% by 2100 due to less heating requirement during warmer winters. Moreover, by 2100, the energy demand for an &#x02018;average&#x02019; commercial building is projected to <underline>increase</underline> by 5.1% and 5.4% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively (compared to the historical consumption over 1981&#x02013;2013). The projected increase is due to the commercial sector&#x02019;s greater use of cooling energy, relative to the residential sector, and higher projected daytime temperatures.</p><p>It should be noted that while our proposed framework accounts for demand variation due to climate change, it does not account for potentially higher intensity and frequency of climatic extremes (such as ice-storms and tornados) under climate change. Future work is needed to extend our paradigm to also account for such weather and climate extremes that could become much more intense and frequent under climate change, and have significant impacts on our energy sector in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188033.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McCalley</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shahidehpour</surname></name>, <etal>et al</etal>, <year>2016</year>
