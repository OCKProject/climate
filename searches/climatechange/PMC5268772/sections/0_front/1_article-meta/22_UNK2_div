 <div class="funding-statement">The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations development process was carried out through U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) cooperative agreement #G09AC000001 and #G14AC00042. JEA was supported by a grant to NCEAS from The David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The two grants from USGS supported the creation of the CHIRPS dataset, and the customized trend analysis that supported this paper. While these grants provided the resources for the above activities, the influence of USGS in these activities was minimal. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</div>
