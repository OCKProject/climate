<p class="p">Temperate Grasslands, Savannas &amp; Shrublands, a much smaller biome, in both the Palearctic and Nearctic have experienced more drying (11.3% and 14.2% respectively) than wetting. These realms account for approximately 70% of temperate grasslands. Relatively little change in precipitation was seen in the Neotropics (accounting for 20% of the biome, mainly in Argentina). In North America, in mixed agriculture and rangeland, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Kansas have experienced substantial drying, while further north in the Northern Prairie G200 region in Montana and North Dakota, which is mainly rangeland, there has been significant wetting. In the Palearctic the most substantial area of drying is in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, where livestock mortality among pastoralists has made news headlines in recent years. There has been a small amount of wetting in temperate grasslands in eastern Australia and New Zealand. Population increase in this biome has been under 30% in all realms (except Afrotropic, which at 25,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> accounts for less than 0.5% of the biome).
