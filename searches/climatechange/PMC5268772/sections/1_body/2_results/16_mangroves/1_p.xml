<p class="p">Mangroves are a small but important and very threatened biome. Nearly 25% of mangroves have experienced wetting and population has increased more than 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Mangroves have seen a mix of wetting and drying in the Neotropics and Afrotropics, with wetting in Mexico, Caribbean Islands, Venezuela, and Colombia and drying in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This includes parts of the Amazon-Orinoco, Caribbean, and South America Pacific Mangroves G200 regions. Similarly, there has been wetting of mangroves in Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Nigeria and drying in Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Tanzania. This includes the East African mangroves G200 (Coastal forest of East Africa Hotspot). But there has mainly been wetting in Australasia and IndoMalay in India, Myanmar, Sumatra, and West Papua, overlapping in part with the Indo-Burma and Sundaland Hotspots. Population increase has been under 50% in IndoMalay (156 people/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and Neotropic (31 peopl/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) realms but 100% (1 person/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in Australasia and 87% (94 people/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in the Afrotropics. Mangrove forests are extremely important for biodiversity and a multitude of ecosystem services including coastal protection and very high carbon storage [
