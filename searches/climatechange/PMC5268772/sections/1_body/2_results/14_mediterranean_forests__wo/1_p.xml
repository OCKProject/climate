<p class="p">The majority of the Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands, &amp; Scrub biome is found in the Palearctic in the Mediterranean Basin Hotspot (which overlaps with the Mediterranean G200 region), where nearly 17% of the area has experienced wetting, particularly in Italy, Turkey, Morocco and Algeria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). In contrast about 12% of the biome has experienced drying in the Australasian Realm, in the Southeast Australia Hotspot and G200 region around Perth, with both realms experiencing a similar population change of around 25%. Although it accounts for a small area, at 8% population change, this is the only biome in the Afrotropic Realm with a population growth less than 65%. It is also the biome with the greatest proportion of area drying (17%) in the realm, in the G200 Fynbos area of the Cape Floristic Region Hotspot around Cape Town, South Africa. Little of this biome has experienced precipitation change in the Nearctic or Neotropic. The largest patch of drying in the southern tip of the Chilean Mattoral (Chilean Winter Rainfall and Valdivian Forests Hotspot), but there has been nearly 50% population growth in the Mediterranean biome in both realms.
