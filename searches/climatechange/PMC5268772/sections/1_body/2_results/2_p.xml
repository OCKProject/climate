<p class="p">In an effort to assess the impacts of such wetting or drying on critical biogeophysical systems, we intersected the observed precipitation trends with other datasets. Global 200 prioritizes the ecoregions that make up the biomes described below, based on irreplaceability but not on vulnerability [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, similar to the global average, more than 20% of the area of Global 200 regions have experienced drying (4.4%) or wetting (17.6%) (
