There was also wetting in some areas in northern Afghanistan. There has been some drying in the Indian Himalayas, part of the Himalaya Hotspot. These are largely pastoral anthromes (

The largest patches of wetting in the Afrotropics are found in the Ethiopian highlands G200 region (or Eastern Afromontane Hotspot), which is mainly rainfed agriculture. There is also wetting in South Africa and Lesotho, part of it in a G200 region that includes both rainfed agriculture and rangeland anthromes. More than 17% of montane grasslands in the Andes Hotspot have experienced wetting (
