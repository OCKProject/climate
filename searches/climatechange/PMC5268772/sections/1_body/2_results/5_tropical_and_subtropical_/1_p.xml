<p class="p">Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests is the biome that contains some of the most important terrestrial carbon sinks, as well as exceptional biodiversity. The Neotropic realm houses nearly half of these forests and about 20% have experienced wetting compared to 4% drying; there has been 43% population growth (or 8.3 people/ km

In the Mesoamerica hotspot, large areas of moist forest in eastern Honduras and Nicaragua have experienced drying as well as from Lake Nicaragua into Costa Rica. This hotspot (encompassing several biomes) has experienced nearly 11% drying, 18% wetting and 56% population increase. We found wetting in Veracruz, Mexico as well as in the Caribbean Islands Hotspot—Hispaniola has experienced wetting in Haiti and some significant drying in northern parts of the Dominican Republic. In several Amazonian G200 regions, we found areas of wetting and drying. We found large areas of wetting in the northern and western part of the Amazon basin (Para and Amazonas, Brazil and Guyana) as well as in Peru. We found smaller, but substantial patches of drying in the western central part of the basin–such as near Pucallpa, Peru and Acre, Brazil—and in Bolivia. The Southwestern Amazonian Moist Forests was one of the G200 regions that has experienced the most drying. Although only 6.6% of the Southwestern Amazonian Moist Forest is drying (and 15.4% is wetting), this represents over 120,000 km
