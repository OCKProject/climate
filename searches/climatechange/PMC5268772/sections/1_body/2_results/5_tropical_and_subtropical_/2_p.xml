<p class="p">Nearly the same area of forest in the IndoMalay realm has experienced wetting (33% of the biome in this realm), with negligible drying. Percent population change has been the same as the Neotropic realm (43%), but an increase of 89 people/km

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> or 25%. We found scattered patches of drying in the Indo-Burma Hotspot (including North Indochina Moist forest G200) in Laos and Yunnan, China, as well as in northern Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. The Australasian realm contains a much smaller area of tropical moist forest, but 26% has experienced wetting and 6% drying, while population has increased 55%. There has been wetting in the Sulawesi, West Papua and Moluccas moist forests. We found a large patch of drying in the center of New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands. This includes the Wallacea and East Melanesian Islands Hotspots and several overlapping G200 regions, as well as several New Guinea G200 regions, all mainly rainfed agriculture anthromes.
