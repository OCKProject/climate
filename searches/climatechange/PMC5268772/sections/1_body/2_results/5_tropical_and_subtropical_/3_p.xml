<p class="p">In the Afrotropic realm only about 6% of the tropical moist forest has experienced wetting and another 6% drying, but this biome has seen more than 90% population increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). This Afrotropics biome is primarily a rainfed agriculture anthrome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). We found small patches of drying in the Congo Basin in Gabon, Cameroon, and Democratic Republic of Congo in the Northeastern, Central, and Western Congo Basin Moist Forest G200 regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Population in these G200 regions has increased between 84% and 127%, representing an average 2 or fewer people/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> increase due to the currently sparse population in this large and relatively intact (thus, not a Hotspot) basin. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] reported significant browning of Congo basin forests correlated with a persistent drying trend. However, our analysis screened out much of the reduction in wet season precipitation because it represented less than 15% of the three month average over the 32 year study period. We found patches of drying in East African Coastal Forest G200 region in Kenya and Tanzania (and 88% population increase) and some wetting in Mozambique. The Madagascar Hotspot has experienced wetting in the south and some drying in the north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). In the Guinean Forests of West Africa hotspot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>), there were only small patches of drying in Sierra Leone and of wetting in Liberia and Cote Dâ€™Ivoire. However, this hotspot has experienced extremely high population growth, both in percent increase (90%) and increase in density (84 people/ km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). While we found that tropical moist forests in Africa have not experienced a great deal of precipitation change in the last 3 decades, high rates of population increase are increasing pressure on these forests and on wildlife.
