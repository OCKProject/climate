<p class="p">Globally, we found that the Tropical &amp; Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas &amp; Shrublands Biome have had the highest population increase of 83% growth between 1990–2015; 28% of this biome is wetting and 4.2% drying. It is the biome with both the greatest total drying and wetting areas concurrently. As a very agriculturally important biome (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g006" class="xref">6</xref>), it is of particularly high interest for conservation and adaptation efforts. In the Afrotropic realm, which contains 69% of Tropical &amp; Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas &amp; Shrublands, 30.8% has experienced wetting (

This includes a band of wetting across the Sahel, largely in pastoral/rangeland uses, with rainfed agriculture in the southern parts of the band and also some wetting of the G200 Sudanian Savannahs (100% population increase). Similar increasing precipitation trends in the Sahel have been previously documented [

The Sahel also includes a large area of both pastoral and rain fed agricultural land in the Zambezian woodlands (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Angola), including the mostly pastoral Central and Eastern Miombo woodlands G200 priority. There has been an area of drying in the Katanga region of Democratic Republic of Congo in the same G200 priority region (Miombo woodlands), an important agricultural region of the country. The largest areas of drying (more than 275,000 km

The Horn of Africa is the hotspot that, apart from experiencing significant drying, has also seen the second greatest population increase at 115%, as has been previously documented [
