<p class="p">Nearly 20% of the tropical grasslands biome is found in the Neotropics where 10.2% is drying in scattered patches in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia and only 5% is wetting, mainly in Uruguay. This includes scattered drying in the Cerrado Hotspot and G200 region in Brazil, which includes a combination of agriculture and pastoralism. In Australasia, where 11% of tropical grasslands are found, 55.9% of the biome–in the Northern Australia and Trans Fly Savannahs G200 region (pastoral/rangeland anthrome)—has experienced wetting. In each of these realms, population change in tropical grasslands has been 45% or greater (89% in the Afrotropics).</p>
