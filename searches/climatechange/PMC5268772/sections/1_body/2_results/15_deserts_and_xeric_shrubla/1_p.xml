<p class="p">Deserts and Xeric Shrublands are the most extensive biome in our dataset (27.8 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Although it represents only 7% of this biome, nearly 2 million km

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) has occurred in the Afrotropic realm, particularly in the Kalahari, but also in the G200 Namib-Karoo-Kaokoveld and the desert portion of the Madagascar Hotspot (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). There has also been some drying in the Masai xeric grasslands in Kenya. Primarily rangelands and pastoral anthromes, deserts and xeric shrublands in the Afrotropic have experienced population increase of 127%.The vast majority of this biome is found in the Palearctic, but only 3% has experienced precipitation change; there has been 74% (6 people/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) population increase. There has been wetting in largely pastoral areas in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and in the G200 Central Asian Desert in Kazakstan. There has also been some wetting in the G200 Atacama-Sechura desert in Peru, and the G200 Chihuahan-Tehuacan Desert in Mexico. Though they are not G200 or hotspots, there has been substantial drying of rainfed agricultural anthromes in the Catinga in Brazil and there has been wetting in rainfed agriculture in thorn scrub in India and in pastoral lands in Pakistan.
