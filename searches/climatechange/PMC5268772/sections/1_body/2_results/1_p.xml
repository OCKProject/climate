<p class="p">Between 50 degrees latitude north and south, we found that 17.5% of the terrestrial area has become wetter compared to only 3.7% that has undergone significant drying over the last three decades (

At the same spatial extent and time period, we calculated a 38% average increase in total population density using the GPW dataset. The IndoMalay realm has experienced more wetting (37.3%) than average, as has the Afrotropic Realm (26.1%), while the Nearctic (6.7%) and Neotropic (6.2%) realms have experienced more drying than the global average. Overall, approximately 10.6% of the Palearctic realm has experienced wetting while only 2.3% has been undergoing drying trends over the last three decades.
