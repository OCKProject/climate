<p class="p">Temperate Coniferous Forest is a biome for which substantial area falls outside our study area. Within our study area, in the Nearctic, very little area has experienced either wetting or drying (just 4% of each)—although there are patches of drying in western Louisiana and northern Florida and wetting in southern Florida, including the G200 Southeastern Conifer and Broadleaf Forests—and the biome has seen 38% population growth. But in the Palearctic 20% of the area has experienced wetting–including patches in the European-Mediterranean Montane Forest G200, in northern Iran, in the Irano-Anatolian Hotspot/Caucasus-Anatolian-Hyrcanian Temperate Forest G200 region, Slovakia, and around the Hengduan Mountains in China in the Mountains of Southwest China Hotspot (which has seen the highest population increase of 212%). There has been 58% population growth in the Palearctic.</p>
