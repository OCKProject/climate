Forested areas have experienced some drying but more wetting. We looked in greater depth at rangelands and rainfed agriculture, which have experienced more drying and wetting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). More than 40% of rangeland and almost 30% of rainfed agriculture in our dataset have experienced wet season wetting or drying over the last three decades. We found substantial areas of drying rangelands in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China, as well Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. There were also drying rangelands in northern Argentina, south central United States, Tibet, and Iraq. Rangelands have experienced wetting in the Sahel, southern Africa, central China, northern Australia, and north central United States. Similarly, rainfed agriculture has experienced wetting in India, Southeast Asia, Europe, eastern China, the Sahel, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Central America and eastern United States. Drying rainfed agriculture occurred in Ethiopia, northern China, southern Democratic Republic of Congo, central and upper Midwest of the United States, Brazil, and Tibet.
