<p class="p">Wetlands are extremely important for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Accounting for nearly half of the biome, in the Afrotropics, 38% of Flooded Grasslands and Savannas have experienced wetting (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g006" class="xref">6</xref>). The biome has seen 80% population growth in the Afrotropics. On the other hand, in the Neotropics, more than 15% of the biome has been drying, mainly in the Pantanal and northeastern Argentina; whereas the Orinoco wetlands in Venezuela, a G200 priority, have experienced drying. The Pantanal is the largest tropical wetland and both a Ramsar and UNESCO World Heritage site. There were some areas of wetting in the Florida Everglades, a G200 conservation priority. Some wetlands in the Caribbean Islands Hotspot have also gotten wetter. Although the IndoMalay accounts for a small portion of the biome, more than 90% of its Flooded Grasslands and Savannas have experienced wetting, all of it in the Ran of Kutch flooded grasslands, a mainly pastoral anthrome and G200 priority, in Gujarat, India. There has been little change in precipitation in flooded grasslands in the Palearctic, but some drying in the northeast corner of China. The Palearctic has experienced an average increase of over 90 people/km
