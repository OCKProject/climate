<p class="p">Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests are the second largest forest type in our data set, found primarily in the Palearctic and Nearctic realms, but much of the biome falls outside of our area of study (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g005" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g006" class="xref">6</xref>). This biome has seen modest changes in precipitation, with wetting and drying at the global average in the Palearctic and just slightly more drying and less wetting in the Nearctic. Population growth in this biome in both realms has been under 20%. Within our study area in the Palearctic, we found large patches of wetting in Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, with smaller wetting patches in Romania, Croatia, Turkey, Ukraine, France, and Italy. There were large patches of both wetting and drying in the Irano-Anatolian Hotspot in Iran and smaller drying areas in Serbia, Georgia, and southern Russia, including parts of the Caucasus Hotspot (which has experienced low population increase of 13%). In China there were large patches of wetting in the Huang He and Changjiang Plains and the southern part of the Central Loess Plateau. There was substantial wetting in the southern part of the Manchurian forest in North and South Korea and drying in the northern part in China. Additionally, the Central Korean forests and Changbai Mountains Mixed forests have experienced substantial wetting. In the Nearctic, there has been substantial wetting in the northeastern US and Canada from New York to Nova Scotia and Quebec. The Great Lakes region, Minnesota, as well as small patches in Texas and Alabama have experienced drying. In Australasia, small areas of the eastern Australian temperate forests, Tasmania, and southern New Zealand have experienced wetting, while parts of the Southeast Australia temperate forest and northern New Zealand have experienced drying. This includes the Forests of East Australia and New Zealand Hotspots and the Tasmanian Temperate Rainforest G200 region. In the Chilean Winter Rainfall and Valdivian Forest Hotspot (and G200) there have been some patches of drying and wetting in this biome. In the Indo Malay in the Himalaya Hotspot and G200 regions, there was drying in the Western Himalaya in India and some wetting in the Eastern Himalaya in India and Bhutan. Population in the IndoMalay in this biome has increased 69%.
