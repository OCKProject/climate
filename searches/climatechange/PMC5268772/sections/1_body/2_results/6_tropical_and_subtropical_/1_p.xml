<p class="p">The Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forest biomes are found mainly in the IndoMalay realm, where nearly 60% of the biome is wetting, and in the Neotropics, where just 13% is wetting and 6% drying (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g006" class="xref">6</xref>). We found wetting in dry forests in the Indochina dry forest G200, part of the Indo-Burma Hotspot. In addition, large areas of dry forest in the center of India have experienced drying. In Bolivia, there were small patches of drying in the G200 Chiquitanos dry forests (the G200 region with the second highest percent change in population of 181%) and some wetting in dry forest in the Tropical Andes Hotspot. In the Mesoamerica and the Caribbean Islands Hotspots, we found small patches of wetting and drying in Southern Mexican Dry Forest G200 and wetting in the Cuban dry forest. Although this biome has undergone 87% population growth in the Afrotropics, it accounts for a small area in that realm. A small area of tropical dry forest has been drying in Madagascar (a hotspot) and wetting in Zambia. Population has increased by 42% in the IndoMalay in comparison to 87% in the Afrotropics in this biome, however because the IndoMalay is so much more densely populated this represents 10 times greater increase in density than in the Afrotropics (79 compared to 7.9 people/km
