 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] as a polygon overlay to examine major patterns of livelihoods worldwide and their relationship to natural biomes. We used anthromes as a proxy for potential hypothesized expansion or intensification of primarily subsistence-based practices such as agriculture or grazing into areas of lower population density or previously unoccupied land as a function of population growth rates. In order to identify broad regions of land use types worldwide, we combined the original anthromes classification scheme into six categories of interest: settlements, rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, rangelands, forested areas and wildlands.
