<p class="p">We used WWF’s The Ecoregions of the World polygon dataset to identify biomes, ecoregions, realms, and Global 200 conservation priority areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. We used Conservation International’s Hotspots polygon dataset for additional conservation priorities [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Two widely used conservation prioritizations are 
 <bold class="bold">Global 200</bold> [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and 
 <bold class="bold">Biodiversity Hotspots</bold> [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Global 200 ecoregions are identified as ecoregions with highly distinctive or irreplaceable biodiversity (species richness and endemism) for their biome or realm. Their conservation status (critical/endangered, vulnerable, or stable) was assessed by habitat loss and fragmentation [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Biodiversity hotspots are based on plant and vertebrate species endemism and degree of threat from habitat loss (to qualify, a hotspot must have already lost 70% or more of its primary vegetation) [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. While both Biodiversity Hotspots and Global 200 consider irreplaceability, only Biodiversity Hotspots considers vulnerability, making it ‘reactive’ according to Brooks et al.’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] classification, whereas Global 200 is considered ‘neutral’ with respect to vulnerability, meaning that it targets neither particularly vulnerable nor particularly intact ecoregions. Although these prioritizations are at least a decade old, they remain widely used.
