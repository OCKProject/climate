<p class="p">To make sure that the trends identified in the SPI were also meaningful in physical terms, the regression coefficients were screened as both a change in millimeters per year and as a percentage of the mean annual precipitation. Those locations where the absolute value of the trend was less than 1.5 mm/year, or roughly 50 mm over the CHIRPS time series, were classified as "no trend" to make sure that fairly small trends in rainfall accumulation were not highlighted as meaningful in biophysical terms. The second step of the analysis included checks to ensure that the absolute value of the trend is one-half of one percent of the average rainfall in the wettest three months, or roughly 15% over the entire CHIRPS time series. This check avoids including seemingly large trends in terms of millimeters, but which are dwarfed by the mean in exceptionally wet areas, and therefore fairly inconsequential to vegetation and agricultural growing conditions. Conversely, in drier areas, relatively small changes in rainfall could produce large percent changes due to the small average (i.e. dividing by a small number), even though the change in rainfall is not physically meaningful for plant physiology. In this way, the screening of trends in terms of millimeters and percent change identifies locational and phenologically important trends in rainfall. While these conditions may seem rather conservative, it allows us to focus the analysis on only those places that exhibit clear and important precipitation trends. The resulting map captures statistically significant trends in precipitation that potentially impact vegetation and agricultural development in the critical part of the rainy season. One important issue to note is that off-season rainfall is not considered in these trends, and while that is generally not a significant source of rainfall, there are some places where rainfall outside of the three wettest months can be impactful to agricultural productivity, rangeland biomass and water resources.</p>
