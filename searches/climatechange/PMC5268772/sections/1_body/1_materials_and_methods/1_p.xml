<p class="p">Our approach consists of a multi-step combination of several spatiotemporally explicit datasets to identify areas of overlap between long-term precipitation changes, population changes and areas of concern for biodiversity conservation. We identified areas across the globe that have experienced significant changes in rainfall over the past 30 years. We use the climatological wettest three months of precipitation as a percentage of the mean annual precipitation received, measured as a standardized precipitation index (SPI). We chose this metric to account for variations in timing and in quantities of rainfall across the globe making comparisons possible. In areas of rain-fed agriculture, this metric may be a proxy for agricultural potential (along with temperature, evaporation rate and other factors we do not directly account for). We propose that areas experiencing greater magnitudes of change may experience greater direct effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as changes in species composition or rates of primary productivity. We restrict our analysis to between 50 degrees latitude north and south to align with the chosen precipitation product. This spatial limitation is imposed by rainfall training data, which identifies a relationship between cloud top temperatures and rainfall rate [
