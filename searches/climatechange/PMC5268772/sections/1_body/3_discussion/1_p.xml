<p class="p">In our dataset we found that globally there has been relatively little wetting and very little drying during the wettest three months over the past three decades that meet our criteria. While this is encouraging, there is nuance in where this wetting and drying has occurred. Furthermore, we used just one metric of changing climate, specifically a change in the wettest three months of the year at each location across the globe. That timing captures a critical period for the agricultural or general vegetation development at any given location, but may miss some meaningful changes in other parts of the year. For instance, some of the drying noted in the Greater Horn of Africa is not identified in annual trends because of increases in rainfall during the second season. Furthermore, our criteria for screening removed many locations where large changes in millimeters weren’t large enough relative to the mean. This was done with agriculture in mind, but certainly other vegetation types may be adversely impacted by trends (large or small), that didn’t pass through our screening process. Furthermore, we are examining historical precipitation trends that include both census-based and projected data. As such, these data may not necessarily be indicative of future trends in all areas.</p>
