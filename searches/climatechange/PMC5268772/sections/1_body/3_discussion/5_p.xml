<p class="p">Human demographic changes (e.g. population growth, age structure, urbanization) have important implications for global greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. While the rate of population increase (% change) is greatest in the Afrotropic realm, the increase in population density (people per km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) -because of very high starting population- in the Indo-malay and parts of the Australasian and Palearctic realms is substantially greater. Human population growth is both a primary driver of climate change and a key factor in climate change vulnerability and adaptation. More people use more resources, which causes more emissions. It has been estimated that if the unmet need for family planning were filled, by 2050 emissions could be reduced by 0.7–1.25GtC/y, or approximately 8–15% of what is needed to avoid warming of more than 2°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Simultaneously, population size impacts the ability of people (at the scale of families, communities, and nations) to adapt to climate change. For example, climate change is already challenging food production systems. Yet as populations continue to grow, more people need to be fed even in the face of climatic challenges to food production systems. Modeling of climate change and population growth in Ethiopia showed that under climate change, reducing population growth reduced the food security gap compared to high population growth both with and without climate change [
