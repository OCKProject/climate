We found that grassland biomes have experienced both high population growth and substantial areas of wetting, which could convert grasslands to croplands via agricultural extensification. Similarly, areas that have undergone sustained drying over the last three decades could arguably experience further conversion of grasslands to croplands to, for example, make up for lowered productivity.
