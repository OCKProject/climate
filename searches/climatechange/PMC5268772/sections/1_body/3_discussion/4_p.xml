 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] anthromes, more than 70% of rangeland and rainfed agriculture in our dataset have experienced wet season wetting or drying over the last three decades. Increases in extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, and higher temperatures, may make rain fed agriculture and livestock forage unreliable. This could create a feedback in which people are forced to put increased pressure on ecosystems (e.g. additional land clearing to make up for low productivity, increased bushmeat consumption to meet basic needs, or intensified grazing). These pressures degrade ecosystems reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for them becomes most critical. Growing populations increase pressure on ecosystems as well. This creates a spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation. Furthermore, this type of deforestation and ecosystem degradation lessens the ability of lands to sequester carbon, and causes greenhouse gas emissions–further contributing to climatic change.
