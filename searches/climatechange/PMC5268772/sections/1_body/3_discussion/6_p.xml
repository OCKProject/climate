<p class="p">However, the interaction between climate change, agriculture, and population growth with land cover change is complicated. While rural population growth causes direct pressure on natural resources for land and water, the relationship between human population and ecosystem degradation may be spatially decoupled. Ecosystem degradation in the form of demand for charcoal, agricultural products, and timber, often comes from urban centers or from a globalized market. For example, the global demand for palm oil, in everything from shampoo to crackers to biofuel, is responsible for significant deforestation throughout Southeast Asia, and increasingly in South America and Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Much of this deforestation has occurred in biodiversity conservation priority areas such as Indonesia. Similarly, a great deal of African demand for charcoal, which is less efficient than fuel wood, comes from growing urban populations; this urban demand is a major driver of deforestation in many countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. As another example, in the Brazilian Cerrado, agriculture threatens biodiversity independently from human population. This is largely due to the increase in mechanized agriculture and expansion of cattle ranching [

Furthermore, particularly when rural to rural migration at the forest frontier leads to repeated clearing of new lands during a lifetime–often in relatively low population density areas—the per capita impact on forests and biodiversity can be disproportionately high [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Nevertheless, patterns of human population density and rate of increase remain good proxies for environmental impacts as well as for the spatial demands for agricultural products and ecosystem services.
