 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and are predicted to continue to face even greater pressures due to agricultural expansion. These tropical ecosystems harbor high proportions of global biodiversity and are conservation priorities according to most schemes. Simultaneously, they encompass a large proportion of developing nations and populations with high vulnerability and exposure to climate change and low adaptive capacity. While we found that tropical forests in Africa have not experienced a great deal of precipitation change in the last three decades, high rates of population increase are putting substantial pressure on these forests and threaten food security. African rural communities are predicted to be among the most vulnerable to climate changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Relatively small increases in population density but large increases in rate of change are likely to put great pressure on agroecosystems. Independent of climate change, agricultural expansion is expected to be greatest in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa, including both humid forests such as the Amazon and Congo Basins, and large areas of semi-arid land, such as the Cerrado, Pantanal, Miombo and Guinea savanna-woodlands [
