<p class="p">We hypothesize that in regions experiencing drying or reduced agricultural potential, particularly where this drying coincides with population increase, there will be greater pressure on ecosystems to obtain alternative livelihoods [

Although wetting may improve agricultural conditions in some cases, when increasing precipitation is concentrated in few rainfall events, chance of soil erosion and flooding greatly increase, making agriculture more uncertain. While agricultural productivity is a function of many hydrometeorological factors, monitoring precipitation as a surrogate for agricultural moisture availability captures the largest source of variability in the crop water balance. With this in mind, we use rainfall during the wettest consecutive three months of the year as a proxy for growing season water availability. In addition, we posit that areas experiencing wetting or improvement of agricultural conditions are likely to see an expansion of agriculture, particularly on formerly marginal and environmentally sensitive lands [

Where increased agricultural productivity coincides with population growth, these pressures will be greater; however, because demands are often regional or global, they may be decoupled from local population patterns [
