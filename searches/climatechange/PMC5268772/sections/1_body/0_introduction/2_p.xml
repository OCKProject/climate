<p class="p">Climate change is predicted to have major direct effects on biodiversity. Already climate change impacts, such as phenological changes and range shifts, have been documented for many species [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. As with human populations, species vulnerability to climate change is a function of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Although predictive models have forecast dramatic rates of global extinction due to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], there is great heterogeneity in the sensitivity and response of individual species [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Relatively few recent species extinctions can be definitively attributed to climate change, because of interactions with other anthropogenic threats like habitat loss [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Indeed, it is widely agreed that the greatest cause of biodiversity loss is habitat loss and degradation resulting from land-use change [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species’ sensitivity to and ability to respond to climate change (e.g. climate-driven range shifts may be limited by landscape patterns), amplifying the negative effects of both stressors [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The processes of land use and land cover change and conversions, deforestation, and land degradation are driven by a complicated array of interacting factors that vary geographically and politically. Some underlying causes of change and degradation are shifting markets, commodity prices, poverty, political structures, policies and governance, and population growth (including in-migration) [
