<p class="p">In response to the dramatic decline in biodiversity, a number of organizations have created global prioritization schemes for biodiversity conservation. These prioritizations are usually based on some combination of irreplaceability (usually measured as endemism of one or more taxa), species richness, and vulnerability (often assessed as habitat loss, threatened species, land tenure, or human population growth and density); sensitive ecoregions or biomes [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] developed the concept of “anthromes” or anthropogenic biomes to characterize and map human interactions with terrestrial biomes and subsequent modifications. Their research reveals notable heterogeneity in human impacts globally. Potential interactions of human population growth and biodiversity have yet to be assessed within the context of global climate change.
