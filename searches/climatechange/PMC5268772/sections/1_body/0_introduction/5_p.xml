<p class="p">Human populations most reliant on natural systems and least responsible for climate change tend to be the ones most vulnerable to and most burdened by negative impacts of climate change [

Rural populations, particularly in developing countries, are uniquely vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate changes because they depend directly on climate-sensitive natural resources including local sources of drinking water, agricultural lands, livestock forage, and other natural products [

 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Both negative and positive impacts of climate change on agricultural potential may lead to deforestation and ecosystem degradation through land clearing and shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation. This reduces the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including carbon sequestration, and causes greenhouse gas emissionsâ€“further contributing to climatic change. In some cases, activities that can help households adapt to climate change, such as agricultural extensification, intensification, or livelihood diversification may degrade and deplete the natural resources that act as a safety net, especially for vulnerable groups like women [
