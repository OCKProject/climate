<p class="p">Recurring droughts affecting food security (combined with population growth and insecure land tenure) have been linked to land use/land cover changes. For example, Acacia woodlands have declined in the central Rift Valley in Ethiopia as farmers have shifted from predominantly pastoral livelihoods to a crop-livestock mixed farming system as a better strategy to reduce vulnerability to drought [

In the eastern part of the Gran Chaco, Argentina, an increase in rainfall improved rainfed agricultural conditions while simultaneously deforestation accelerated in comparison to the western part where rainfall did not increase ([

Simulations in Burkina Faso predict transformation of grasslands of the Sahel to cropland due to increased precipitation in the north and conversion of woodlands into croplands in the south driven by demand for agricultural products, accompanied by changes in plant species distributions and diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In some cases, however, growing urban population and urban and international demand for forest and agricultural products are stronger correlates of forest loss than rural population growth [
