<p class="p">The results of this Maxent simulation of climate change impacts on the distribution of two 
 <italic class="italic">Nardostachys</italic> species and prediction of their potential distributions under current and future climate conditions are reliable. Considering the effects of climate change, 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> is more suitable for cultivation. In addition, precipitation of the driest period is an important factor in the impact of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic>. It is of great significance to study the impact of climate change on the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Nardostachys</italic> to predict their potential distribution in the future for the protection, sustainable use, and value assessment of these biological resources. It is essential to conduct future studies on the effect of watering of 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> for developing effective techniques to cultivate 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic>. The study will provide references for the cultivation planning and resource utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic>.
