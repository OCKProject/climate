<p class="p">According to the above results, the suitable habitat 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> varies greatly under different climate scenarios and was more affected by climate change. However, the potential distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> showed a growing trend in different climate scenarios compared to its current situation and was less affected by climate change. Therefore, in order to avoid the impact of climate change on the artificial cultivation of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Nardostachys,</italic> and achieve stable development, we could choose 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> as the main cultivated species.
