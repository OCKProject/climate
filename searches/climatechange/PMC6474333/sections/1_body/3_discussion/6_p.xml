<p class="p">According to the results of above forecase, we can conclude that precipitation of the driest period is the most important environmental factor affecting the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic>. The research has shown that while comparing the distribution of the two contrasting hill slopes (east and west), the density of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> has increased significantly with altitude was revealed on a west-facing slope. And the north and west-facing slopes in the alpine zone of this region are broadly considered as the shady areas with low light and high moisture (

 <italic class="italic">valerian</italic> species (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bernath, 1997</xref>). These results indicated that the precipitation plays a dominant role in simulating the effects of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> compared to temperature and other environmental variables.
