<p class="p">This indicated that more areas will be suitable for the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic>, which would have greater potential for expansion in China in the future under a low-emission scenario, contrary to high-emission scenarios. In addition, suitable areas in Qinghai and Tibet decreased obviously and exhibited a trend of northward expansion. Nevertheless, suitable sites in the high altitude area of Tibet markedly increased. And previous studies have shown that with global warming, some species will migrate to high latitude or high elevation (
