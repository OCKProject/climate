 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ma &amp; Sun (2018)</xref> had predicted the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa purpurea</italic> across the Tibetan Plateau via the Maxent model. The habitat suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. purpurea</italic> in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 revealed that the habitat suitability for the species increased from the 1990s to 2050s, then decreased from the 2050s to 2070s. Their results indicated the trend of the suitable habitat area was consistent with our prediction. However, they also considered the impact of topographic variables in the study, which was our shortcoming.
