 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al. (2011)</xref> considered that the average probability of species being present in suitable areas was 0.5. For the two species in this study, the area with probabilities above 0.5 was the main natural distribution area. Thus, the probabilities above 0.5 was defined as suitable habitats, and probabilities less than 0.5 were unsuitable based on the study of
