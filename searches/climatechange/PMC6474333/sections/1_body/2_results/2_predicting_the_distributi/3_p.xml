<p class="p">Suitable areas of 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> were mainly distributed at the junction of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Sichuan and Qinghai Provinces in China. Sichuan Province has the most suitable habitats. This was consistent with the collection records from Sichuan, indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> was primarily distributed in the province, and no suitable habitats were indicated in other countries. According to the prediction, the area in which 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> is distributed was significantly larger than the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> under current conditions.
