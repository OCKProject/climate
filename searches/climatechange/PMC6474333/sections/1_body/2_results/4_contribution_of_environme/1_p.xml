<p class="p">A total of 19 bioclimatic variables from the BIOCLIM climate dataset were used as the background environmental data, such as temperature and rainfall. These variables are comprehensive conclusions and quantitative descriptions of the climatic environment in the regions containing the targeted species. The potential distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> were simulated by the Maxent model, which automatically predicted the contribution percentage of each variable to the forecasted results. 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> listed selected bioclimatic variables and their percent contribution in the Maxent model for 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic> in their current distribution range. Among them, precipitation of the driest period (Bio14) was the largest contributing factor when modeling the distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensis</italic>.
