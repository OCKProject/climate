<p class="p">Species distribution models could simulate the potential ecological niche of a species from various hypotheses about how environmental factors control the distribution of species and communities based on known occurrence points (

Therefore, the species distribution models could provide the basis for planting land selection and growing climatic conditions during the cultivation of the two plants. The main species distribution models for species distribution predictions include Bioclim, Climex, Domain, Garp, and Maxent maximum entropy modeling. Among these models, the Maxent model has a strong advantage in predicting species distribution and gained popularity, which is a presence-only modeling technique using a machine learning approach (
