<p class="p">The area under the receiver operating curve, called AUC, was used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction results (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). AUC values range from zero to one, and the larger the AUC value, the farther away from the random distribution. High AUC values indicate the better prediction of the model. AUC values generally range from 0.5 to 0.7 when accuracy is low; moderate accuracy is generally 0.7âˆ¼0.9; a high degree of accuracy is typically greater than 0.9 (
