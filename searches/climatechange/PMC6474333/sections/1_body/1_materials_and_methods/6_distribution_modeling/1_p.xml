<p class="p">The Maxent model was a widely used and effective model for species distribution modeling because it produced believable results. It is based on the freely available Maxent software V3.3.3k (

Maxent was used to predict the current and future potential distributions of

 <italic class="italic">N. chinensi</italic>s based on the occurrence records and climate data. The logical output (results are expressed in terms of probability) was selected to assess the likelihood of the presence of a species in each grid cell. A total of 25% of the occurrence records were chosen as the test set, and the remaining parameters were the default settings (

Jackknifing in the environment parameter settings was checked to measure the percentage contribution of each environmental variable and to evaluate the importance of environmental factors in affecting the geographical distribution of species.
