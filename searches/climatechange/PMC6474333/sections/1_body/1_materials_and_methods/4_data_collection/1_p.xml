<p class="p">Occurrence records of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensi</italic>s were mainly obtained through online databases and consulting literature. The online database includes the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.cvh.ac.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cvh.ac.cn/</uri>), Specimen Resources Sharing Platform for Education (
 <uri xlink:href="http://mnh.scu.edu.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mnh.scu.edu.cn/</uri>), and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.gbif.org/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gbif.org/</uri>). The literature used was open-source and available worldwide. In the absence of specific geographical coordinate records, Google Earth 7.0 was utilized to find the approximate latitude and longitude according to the described geographical location. After duplicate and invalid records were removed, the sampling points of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensi</italic>s were 183 and 60, respectively. We obtained sampling points from the specimen database and literature, and all the specimens collected in the specimen database are wild. In accordance with the requirements of the Maxent software, the distribution records of 
 <italic class="italic">N. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. chinensi</italic>s were organized into .csv format files including the species name and distribution point longitude and latitude, with the east and north latitudes positive and the west and south latitudes negative.
