<p id="P18" class="p">Based on the simple average across the 18 GCMs, the mean annual temperature increase in SHUE cities (relative to 2017) was estimated to be 0.93 degrees Celsius by 2050 and 1.10 degrees Celsius by 2100 under RCP2.6, and 1.27 degrees Celsius by 2050 and 4.15 degrees Celsius by 2100 under RCP8.5 (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The corresponding figures for the hottest month of the year were 1.01 and 1.17 degrees Celsius by 2050 and 2100, respectively, under RCP2.6, and 1.38 and 4.48 degrees Celsius under RCP8.5. This emphasizes the relatively modest increases in temperature by mid-century under each of these GHG emissions pathways, but the much greater changes by the end of the century unless there is a unless there is a rapid reduction of GHG emissions to bring the pathway much closer to that of RCP26.
