<p id="P24" class="p">There was no clear pattern of association between the temperature increase for the hottest month and city size (population) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The temperature increases for SHUE ‘Megacities’ over 10 million in population (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> represents only present day populations; these populations are likely to increase considerably over the century, especially in Asia and Africa. The ability of cities to adapt may vary depending on their size, with smaller but growing cities better able to implement the necessary heat adaptation infrastructure, and on their wealth, with richer cities better able to afford mitigation measures.
