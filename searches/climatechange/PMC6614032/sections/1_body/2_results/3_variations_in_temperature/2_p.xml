 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the well-documented amplification of warming at high-latitudes. The smallest temperature increases are estimated to be those for cities close to the equator, and the largest in cities at latitudes around 40 to 50 degrees north, with somewhat smaller increases at latitudes above this. Corresponding to the latitudinal patterns, the temperature increases for the hottest month were generally largest for (humid) temperate and dry regions, and somewhat lower for humid tropical climates, although there was overlap in the increase across all these categories. Climate differences across ecoregions may affect the ability of cities to adapt to increasing temperaturesâ€”for example, the ability to provide greening for urban cooling.
