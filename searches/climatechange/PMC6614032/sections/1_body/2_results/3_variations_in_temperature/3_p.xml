<p id="P22" class="p">The differences in temperature changes in the hottest and coldest months by ecoregion domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) are potentially important because of differences in diurnal and seasonal temperature variations in each region. Although the increment in T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> for the hottest month was smallest for humid tropical regions, cities in these regions tend to have high relative and absolute humidity, and small diurnal and seasonal variation in ambient temperatures. Cities in the temperate and dry regions, however, with the largest temperature increments for the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> of the hottest month according to our estimates, tend to have generally lower relative humidity and appreciably greater diurnal and seasonal variation.
