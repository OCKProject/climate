The combination of heat and humidity (as reflected by high wet bulb globe temperatures and similar indices) presents a particular physiological stress [

Also, in tropical climates there is usually limited nocturnal relief. In contrast, the cities in temperate and dry climates with larger potential temperature increases have much greater diurnal and seasonal variation in both temperatures and humidity, which offer potential options to help control indoor environments through the buffering effect of thermal mass [
