<p id="P26" class="p">Although we do not here attempt to quantify the health and social impacts of these temperature rises, in a recent multi-country analysis of temperature-related mortality, the ‘optimum temperature’ (i.e., the point of minimum mortality in relation to daily temperature), was found to vary from around the 60th percentile of the daily distribution in tropical areas to around the 80–90th percentile in temperate regions [

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], and often to temperatures that are well beyond the current distribution. Such increases are likely to present considerable challenges to adaptation and health protection, especially for cities where the mean temperature (i.e., calculated using both day and night temperatures) for the whole month rises above core body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius—as it does in several locations in our analysis.
