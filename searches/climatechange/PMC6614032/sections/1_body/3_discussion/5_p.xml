<p id="P28" class="p">The data we present do not provide information on future changes in extremes of temperature. However, the fact that the temperature increases for the hottest month were generally similar to the temperature increase for the whole year (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) suggests that most of the increase in exposure to the highest temperatures may occur because of the upward shift in the mean temperature distribution rather than by increasing the frequency of temperature extremes by spreading the distribution at a given mean. We acknowledge, however, that these monthly means are not necessarily very sensitive to changes at the tails of the temperature distribution. Moreover, this conclusion of course depends on the ability of current GCMs to capture distributional shifts accurately. In any event, an upward shift in the mean temperature for the year or the hottest month would lead to exposures that are very rare or non-existent under the current climate conditionsâ€”and hence by definition present extreme challenges for current heat adaptation strategies.
