<p id="P25" class="p">The results of these analysis provide an insight into the temperature increases that may occur in cities over this century under high and low GHG emissions trajectories. The results confirm substantial increases in hottest month temperatures in all cities under RCP8.5 by the end of the century, with many likely to experience increases of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius, especially in cities at higher latitudes with temperate or dry climates. More generally, the work demonstrates the desirability of having consistent data on a large and globally-representative sample of cities. Such information can enable a better understanding of interactions between climate change and other environmental health issues, including the potential to achieve co-benefits across multiple risks through actions to improve urban sustainability [
