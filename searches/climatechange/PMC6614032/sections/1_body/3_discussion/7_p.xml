<p id="P30" class="p">Combined assessment of temperature and humidity, UHI effects, and more detailed assessment of the implications for health are all important steps for further research, therefore. However, the main policy implications are clear. The first is the importance of aggressive reduction in GHG emissions in order to help reduce the more extreme temperature rises for urban populations that could be expected from emissions trajectories similar to that represented by RCP8.5. The second is to ensure adaptation planning takes account of the likelihood of very sizeable temperature increases in urban centres around the globe that will lead many populations to be exposed to temperatures well beyond those of their current experience.</p>
