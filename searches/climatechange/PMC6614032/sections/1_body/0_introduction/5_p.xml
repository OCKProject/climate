<p id="P6" class="p">In this paper, we use a large ensemble of GCMs to examine the patterns of temperature rise that may be expected in cities across the globe under a high and a low GHG emissions trajectory. The analysis is based on data from the Sustainable Health Urban Environments (SHUE) project, which has developed a database of information on a globally-distributed sample of cities [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The broad aim of the SHUE project is to support research on the responses to environmental risks to health and the potential impacts for health of strategies for sustainable urban development. The database contains a wide range of information on city characteristics, environmental risks (such as air pollution), and markers of urban form and energy use. This paper describes the climate change data held in the database and demonstrates its application to improving understanding of the benefits of strong climate change mitigation efforts.
