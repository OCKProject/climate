<p id="P16" class="p">For each city, we calculated 30-year averages of monthly T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> for a baseline period (1988–2017, referred to as 2017), a near-future period (2021–2050, referred to as 2050), and a far-future period (2071–2100, referred to as 2100). The ensemble mean (mean of all 18 GCMs) was calculated, together with the annual mean for all series (mean of all 12 monthly values). Analyses presented here are based on changes in the annual average of T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> and for the hottest and coldest months of the year in 2050 and 2100 compared with 2017. The model outputs are presented as changes from the baseline period, rather than as absolute values. The focus on changes in temperature (together with the bias adjustment described above) should help to reduce, though not eliminate, the impact on the analysis of model biases and shortcomings, including some of those related to the relatively coarse spatial scale of the GCMs [
