<p id="P17" class="p">Changes in temperatures for SHUE cities estimated by the GCMs were analysed in relation to markers of their geographical location, including their coordinates (latitude/longitude), Baileyâ€™s ecoregion domain, and WHO region (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific). We also analysed the results in relation to city population size. The analyses were performed using simple tabulation and graphical methods, including analyses of both uni-variate and bi-variate distributions. Where there was no data on city-level characteristics for a given city, the city was excluded from that part of the analysis.</p>
