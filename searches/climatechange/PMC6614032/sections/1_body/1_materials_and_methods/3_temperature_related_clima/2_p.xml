<p id="P8" class="p">Monthly simulated climate data was estimated for SHUE cities using 18 GCMs under a low GHG emissions scenario, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, and a high emissions scenario, RCP8.5 [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. RCP2.6 gives a global average temperature change consistent with the 2015 Paris Agreement (i.e., a change in global temperature of less than 2 °C relative to a pre-industrial baseline), while RCP8.5 is broadly representative of business-as-usual.
