<p id="P10" class="p">A simple bias adjustment was performed at the grid box level for each GCM in order to improve agreement with observations, in this case the CRU-TSv3.22 dataset (which is provided on the same 0.5 degree grid) [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In this simple approach, the difference was calculated between the observed and simulated long-term average for 1961â€“1990. Offset or adjustment factors were calculated for each month and model and then applied in an additive way to the entire simulated series. The assumption underlying any bias adjustment approach is that model biases are stationary.
