 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], stratified by national wealth in terms of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (&lt;US$1045, US$1045–4125, US$4125–12,746, &gt;US$12,746) [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], population size (&lt;100 K, 100 K–500 K, 500 K–1 M, 1 M–5 M, &gt;5 M), and Bailey’s ecoregion ‘domain’ (dry, humid temperate, humid tropical, polar) [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The sample size of 246 was based on calculations of statistical power appropriate for comparative analyses of variables across cities in the database. A further 63 cities were added to this sample, primarily to include cities with specific characteristics and/or policies related to environmental sustainability. Here, we focus only on the 246 randomly-selected cities in the database (
