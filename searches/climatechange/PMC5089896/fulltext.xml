<article-title>Health Impacts of Climate Change in Pacific Island Countries: A Regional Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptation Priorities</article-title>

Thus, he says, the consultants found they had to be flexible and use both quantitative and qualitative methods in their research and analysis.</p><p>The authors examined 13 Pacific island countries in terms of 3 categories of climate-related health concerns that they termed &#x0201c;direct,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;indirect,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;diffuse.&#x0201d; Direct effects included physical and psychological trauma related to an extreme weather event such as a hurricane or a heat wave. Indirect effects included increased burdens of disease resulting from climate-related disruption&#x02014;for instance, a rise in vector-borne diseases if ecological disruption were to create conditions favorable to the spread of pathogen-carrying pests. Finally, diffuse effects included increased mental health problems, injuries, and violent deaths that could result as societal dysfunction unfolds; this unfolding would be due to such phenomena as loss of livelihood or a lack of basic resources including water, food, and housing.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>The teams worked with stakeholders in each country to develop lists of their highest-priority climate-sensitive health risks, then decide which ones to address in their adaptation plans. Some countries chose to include all relevant risks; others picked just those deemed to be the greatest threat. Because of that variation, the report contains this caveat: &#x0201c;The climate-sensitive health risks presented &#x02026; should be considered a synthesis of each country&#x02019;s priorities rather than a true cross-country comparison of risks.&#x0201d;<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>

</p><p>Most countries placed water security, food security, vector-borne diseases, and direct health impacts of extreme weather events among their top priorities. Pacific island populations also face a unique climate-related health risk in terms of their extremely high levels of noncommunicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Noncommunicable diseases are already leading causes of death in these populations,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> partly because of a high dependence on energy-dense, high-calorie imported foods rather than locally grown products.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> In an example of a diffuse effect, climate change could exacerbate these trends because higher temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and sea level rise will make it even more difficult to grow local food; increased reliance on imported foods could, in turn, lead to food insecurity.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Kathryn Bowen, a senior research fellow at the Australian National University, says the work was an important first step. &#x0201c;Until we do these types of vulnerability assessments, we don&#x02019;t know what to respond to,&#x0201d; says Bowen, who was not involved in the study but has done similar work in other parts of the world. &#x0201c;We don&#x02019;t know what problems and policies are in place and what additional work needs to be done.&#x0201d;</p><p>Colin Butler, a professor of public health at the University of Canberra who was not involved in the study, is concerned with the teams&#x02019; method, pointing out that it could result in vital health-related issues not being addressed. &#x0201c;Only Kiribati identifies &#x02018;population pressure&#x02019; as a &#x02018;high-priority climate-sensitive health risk,&#x02019;&#x0201d; he explains, but &#x0201c;demographic pressures are problematic in far more Pacific island countries than Kiribati.&#x0201d; Butler has co-authored papers about how high birth rates in developing countries heighten vulnerability to climate change.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Still, such issues may one day make the priority list of more island countries&#x02014;the authors point out that their assessment is only the first step in a long journey, and they expect the countries&#x02019; adaptation plans to go through frequent revisions in the future. McIver says, &#x0201c;Each country would likely benefit from further support both in doing more sophisticated analysis of climate-sensitive health risks and climate variability and change, and in considering ways those adaption plans can be incorporated into the health and other sector policies.&#x0201d;</p><p>For coauthor Kristie Ebi, a professor of environmental and occupational health science at the University of Washington, the concern is whether there will be enough outside funding to help these nations implement their plans. &#x0201c;These islands are suffering the consequences of climate change, and they&#x02019;re not responsible for it,&#x0201d; she says. &#x0201c;Their total greenhouse gas emissions are tiny &#x02026; so to ask them to take on [the health burdens associated with climate change] without additional funding really isn&#x02019;t fair.&#x0201d;</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
