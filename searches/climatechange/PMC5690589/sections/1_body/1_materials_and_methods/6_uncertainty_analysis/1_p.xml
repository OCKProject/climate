<p class="p">Uncertainties when dealing with large samples and aggregated data can be substantial. Hence, the computation of uncertainty can help understand the meaningfulness of the results. The data sources used to construct the GHG emissions per food product in this study demonstrate that data availability is an important obstacle when aiming at assessing diet-related environmental impacts [
