<p class="p">Where U
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> represents reliability, U2 completeness, U3 temporal correlation, U4 geographical correlation, U5 further technological correlation and U
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> corresponds to an uncertainty factor which is linked to the environmental burden under assessment. This equation enables the calculation of two uncertainty levels (low and high), that are used to compute the standard deviation of the GHG emissions of each individual food product. Details on how the scores are considered in the Pedigree matrix are described in Section A2 in
