<p class="p">Based on these data, a set of 47 diet scenarios were constructed, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188182.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, taking into consideration average diets in Peruvian cities, socioeconomic quintiles and education. It should be noted that Callao (the second largest city in Peru based on the number of inhabitants) is not included in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188182.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> since it is part of Metropolitan Lima (henceforth referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">Lima Metropolitana</italic>). Therefore, all reference to 
 <italic class="italic">Lima Metropolitana</italic> will actually refer to the urban agglomeration of the two cities. All other regional capitals were also included in the study, except for the regions of Loreto and San Martín. For the former, the city of Iquitos (3°44’S; 73°15’W) was excluded from the study due to its particular characteristics in an impassable area of the Amazon basin, constituting as it does the largest continental city on Earth that is not accessible by road from other major cities. Therefore, most of the food products that are airfreighted into the city from Lima or freighted by river from Brazil are subject to high “food miles” GHG emissions as compared to other cities [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. For the latter, the most populous city of the San Martin region, Tarapoto (6°29’S; 76°22’W), was included rather than Moyobamba (6°02’S; 76°58’W), the region’s capital. In addition, the city of Chimbote (9°04’S; 78°35’W), the most populous in the region of Áncash, was included in the study.
