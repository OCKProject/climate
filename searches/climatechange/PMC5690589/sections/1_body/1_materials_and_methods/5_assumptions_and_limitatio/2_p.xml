<p class="p">Despite the fact that Peru is an agricultural nation and is self-sufficient for most of the main food items that are consumed domestically, this is not extendable to all. An extreme case is wheat, for which imports represent approximately 85% of the total consumption [

 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Modelling in the study considered that food production in Peru was all domestically produced. An important motive for doing so was the fact that the origin of imported food stock was not traceable through publicly available data with the level of details required. Nevertheless, these limitations were considered when conducting the uncertainty analysis described in the following subsection, by penalizing those food products with poor data quality in terms of geographical origin.
