<p class="p">Environmental data were available for a total of 68 food products, representing over 95% of the total basket in ENAPREF [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The excluded products are linked to spices and aggregated small quantities of “other” staples or cereals that could not be assigned to a specific item. However, it should be noted that certain goods, such as salt, pepper and other condiments are not included in the data reported by ENAPREF. Similarly, alcoholic beverages, such as beer or 
 <italic class="italic">pisco</italic>, are not considered for computing purposes. Interestingly, a final group of products, including green asparagus, pomegranate or blueberries, correspond to products that have started to be produced on a large scale in Peru in the past few years, but are essentially destined to export to other continents. Therefore, these are not considered by the ENAPREF survey and discarded for the study.
