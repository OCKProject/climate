<p class="p">GHG emission estimations followed standard LCA guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The impact category selected to compute these emissions was the Global Warming Potential (GWP) indicator [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. This category is considered a midpoint, since it represents the direct emissions of GHGs that occur in the life cycle of a product, in other words, an intermediate point along the environmental mechanism that links anthropogenic interventions to a set of areas of protection (e.g., human health or ecosystem damage). GWP is calculated based on the radiative efficiency of each substance (i.e., GHG) and the time horizon over which the calculation is considered. In this particular study, a 100 year timeframe was selected, a consensus subjective value that is commonly used in LCA studies following the hierarchist perspective of the Cultural Theory [
