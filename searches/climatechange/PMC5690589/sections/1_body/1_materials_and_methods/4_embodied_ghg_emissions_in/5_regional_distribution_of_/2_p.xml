<p class="p">To calculate the distance from a site of production to each of the cities evaluated, a plugin in QGIS was used [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Considering that cultivation sites are scattered throughout the Peruvian geography, it was assumed that the freight originates in the centroid of each production region and is transported up to the center of the city under assessment (see A3 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188182.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref> for the computed distances). However, it should be noted that if the centroid of the region did not coincide with the existence of a road, the centroid was adjusted to the closest road included in the database. These distances were then multiplied by the number of metric tons produced per food product in each region to obtain new values in metric tons per kilometer. Thereafter, using the ecoinvent
