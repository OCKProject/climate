<p class="p">As an example, mango is produced mainly in the North coast in the regions of Piura (73.4%), Lambayeque (12.5%) and Cajamarca (2.6%). The cut-off criterion is satisfied, as all three regions contribute at least 2.5% to the national production. Once a new weighted production rate is estimated exclusively based on these three regions, three new factors, 0.83, 0.14 and 0.03, respectively, are obtained. If mangoes are be freighted to

Hence, a final tkm value of 2.43 is calculated for the road freight of 1 metric ton of mango to the capital city. Considering a factor of 0.168 kg CO
