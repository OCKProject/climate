<p class="p">Final distribution of food products to an RDC was modelled based on the production zones. The distance that a particular food product covers from its production site up to the final consumer is named “food miles”. Databases from different Peruvian institutions were used to obtain agriculture and cattle production information [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. From these databases, the annual production of each food product was extracted and disaggregated per region. Thereafter, a selection of the main production sites per product was performed, using 2.5% of national production per region as the cut-off criterion to recalculate a new weighted production rate. This allowed accounting for at least 75% of the national production in all the food products included in the study. This criterion was used due to the fact that the majority of the production is located in a small number of regions (usually four or five) throughout the country, whereas the remaining regions have minimal production rates that do not even fulfil local needs (see Section A2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188182.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The rationale behind this assumption is that the new estimated production rates remain fixed across the different cities, assuming that the distribution of food is carried out homogeneously across the nation. What changes, therefore, is the amount of each food type purchased (and consumed) in each city, as well as the distance from the producing regions to the city in which the food is purchased.
