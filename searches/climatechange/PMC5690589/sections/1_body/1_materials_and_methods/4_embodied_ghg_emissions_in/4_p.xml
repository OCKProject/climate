<p class="p">The system boundary assumed for each product corresponds to the cultivation stage in the case of agricultural and aquaculture products, the fishing and landing of seafood and grazing and slaughter houses in the case of livestock. In all cases, the supply chain was followed until each food product was at the gate of the farm, port or processing plant ready for distribution to wholesalers. Transportation to regional distribution centers (RDCs) was only included for those scenarios for which it was feasible to do so, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188182.t006" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. In this sense, the functional unit (FU) used was 1 kg of product at an RDC ready for retailing, except in the case of milk and other liquid products, such as juices, oils or bottled water, where the FU was 1 L of liquid content. In the case of meat products the FU can be very variable. For this study, a bone free meat FU was assumed for red meat and poultry. In those scenarios in which distribution was not included, the FU was limited 1 kg of product at the gate of the farm, port or processing plant ready for distribution to an RDC.
