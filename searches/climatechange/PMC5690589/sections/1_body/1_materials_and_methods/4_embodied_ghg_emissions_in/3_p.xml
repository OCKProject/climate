<p class="p">Although several studies using life-cycle methods have been developed in Peru in recent years, these were not sufficient to fulfil the complexity of the entire basket of products that were considered in the study. Nevertheless, when available, GHG emissions from local LCA or Carbon Footprint studies were used [
