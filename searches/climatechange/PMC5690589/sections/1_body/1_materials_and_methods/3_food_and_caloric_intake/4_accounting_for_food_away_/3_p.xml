<p class="p">To estimate the final amount of calories that an average person consumes away from home, the following procedure was undertaken. In the first place, the Peruvian Tables of Food Composition were used to calculate the total amount of kilocalories consumed by an average person in the household in each scenario. Once these were computed, the ratio between the average amount of kilocalories and household expenditure per person was obtained (kilocalories per Peruvian sol—PEN). In parallel, it must be noted that one monetary unit in the household is not equivalent to that of restaurants or canteens outside the household, since the structural costs differ considerably. Peruvian specialists were consulted to determine a coefficient that relates food costs with the final price paid by a customer in an average restaurant, which was set at 0.45, with the remaining 0.55 linked to paying personnel, VAT, general expenditures at the eatery and net profit (D’Gallia staff, Department of Culinary Economics, personal communication, February 2017). This coefficient was then multiplied by the FAFH economic expenditure and the caloric-monetary ratio in order to estimate the number of kilocalories consumed outside the household and, thereafter, the GHG emissions considering a fixed value of g CO

This fixed criterion was assumed based on the lack of information related to the food patterns outside the household. The rationale behind this assumption, which is further analyzed in the discussion section, revolves around the basic idea that consumer patterns in and out of the household may have a similar structure.
