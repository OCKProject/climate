<p class="p">The findings in this study demonstrated that actions in terms of food loss reduction or the substitution of ruminant meat in the diet for other, less carbon intensive, protein rich food products can lower per capita emissions considerably. In fact, some of these actions would imply substantial mitigations of GHG emissions on a national level. However, it should be noted that sustained economic growth and the expansion of the medium class in Peru could cause a substantial increase in the amount of animal protein consumed. When added to population growth and the risk of increased cattle ranching, this increase in animal protein consumption could mean Peru facing a struggle to comply with its international commitments in terms of climate change mitigation unless adequate policies are put in place.</p>
