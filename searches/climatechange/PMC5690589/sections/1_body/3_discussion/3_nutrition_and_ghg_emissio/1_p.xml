<p class="p">Following the USDA [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] nutritional approach based on caloric intake, instead of the traditional number of servings approach, the Peruvian average protein intake diet is 20% lower than the recommended diet. Similar patterns are found for other food groups such as fruit and vegetables, 70% and 40% lower respectively. Although certain trends can be explained due to cultural reasons, since traditionally the Peruvian diet consists in large amounts of grains/cereals (rice, maize, wheatâ€¦), most of the average intake shows worrying results [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. For instance, it should be noted that caloric intake from oils, fats and sweets accounts for 23% of the total. In fact, the NCD survey conducted in 2014 in Peru shows that only 10.8% of the adult population consumes 5 or more portions of fruit or vegetables per day, a value that is as low as 9.8% in the Amazon basin and 5.3% in the highlands [

Although optimizing Peruvian food dietary patterns is the main objective of a companion paper in the frame of the same research project and is consequently not analyzed in detail in the current study, we argue that adequate policy-making in Peru to improve the healthiness of the average diet should be analyzed together with efforts to mitigate GHG emissions and other environmental impacts.
