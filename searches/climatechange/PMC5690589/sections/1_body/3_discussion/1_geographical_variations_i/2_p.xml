<p class="p">Based on the data shown in Section A1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188182.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>, expenditure levels linked to FAFH consumption are highest in cities in which household consumption also presents the highest GHG emissions (i.e., Cusco and Puerto Maldonado), in line with studies reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. However, it should be noted that accounting for FAFH GHG emissions is based on the same distribution of food intake as in the household due to lack of statistical data for behavior regarding meals outside the household. While we consider that this is a reasonable proxy to present a complete computation of diet-related GHG emissions, it is important to consider that several studies in the literature have examined the per capita expenditure composition of FAFH food. For instance, Ma et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] identified that in 1998 Chinese households were spending 38% of FAFH total expenditure on meats, whereas expenditure on meats in the household was only 28%. Similar trends were identified for seafood products, whereas inverse tendencies were found for grains, fruits and eggs. In addition, important differences have been identified in FAFH depending on the time of day, on the type of meal, on socioeconomic classes and on whether the expenditure is linked to leisure time or necessity [
