<p class="p">As mentioned in section 3.2, certain differences in terms of GHG emissions can be observed between the main cities in Peru, and a certain tendency can be identified regarding the fact that cities in the Andes present higher environmental impacts. This leads to the obvious inference that differences in environmental impact may be due to two main issues: i) different patterns of consumption regarding the types and groups of food products purchased; and, ii) different expenditure levels of food in and outside the household. For the former, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188182.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> is clear in showing that cities in the Andes, for instance, tend to consume a higher proportion of animal protein, mainly beef and pork, whereas coastal and Amazon basin cities show a lower consumption of animal protein. Moreover, in coastal and Amazon basin areas a higher proportion of animal protein intake is obtained from consumption of fish, which tends to have lower GHG emissions than beef or pork per mass unit [
