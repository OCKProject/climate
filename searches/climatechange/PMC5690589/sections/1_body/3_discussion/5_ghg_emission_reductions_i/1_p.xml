<p class="p">Quinoa, an emblematic Peruvian food product produced in the Andes at altitudes that range from 2800 m to 3600 m, has a minor role in the Peruvian diet, as can be observed in the data used in the current study. However, a parallel study has determined that the GHG emissions linked to quinoa during its production and distribution sum up to roughly 1.03 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq per kg of quinoa. Considering its high protein content (13.6 grams per 100 grams of product), substantial GHG emission reductions could be attained if the Peruvian diet shifted to quinoa consumption while removing meat [

We acknowledge that this shift would imply important economic and social implications, especially because any environmentally sustainable improvement in diet quality in emerging and developing nations assumes the availability of nutritious foods at affordable prices, especially for poor socioeconomic groups [

For instance, if 20% of beef-based protein consumption in the average Peruvian diet were to be substituted by quinoa consumption, GHG emissions could be reduced by 30.9 kg CO
