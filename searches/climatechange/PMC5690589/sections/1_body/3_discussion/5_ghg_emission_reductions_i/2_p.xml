<p class="p">Food replacement by more sustainable products must be done thoughtfully. In this sense, Werner et al. (2013) found that diet optimization regarding GHG emissions can lead to nutritional consequences when dairy products are excluded [

 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found that when animal protein intake is replaced iso-calorically by fruits and vegetables, diet-related GHGs tend to augment. However, we argue that a potential expansion of the agricultural frontier to produce more quinoa would occur in the Peruvian highlands. In this area direct and indirect land use changes would translate into lower GHG emissions due to deforestation than in areas at lower altitudes, namely the Amazon basin, where there is a potential threat of deforestation because of cattle ranching [

 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Moreover, quinoa production still shows vast areas in which there is room for increasing yields considerably [
