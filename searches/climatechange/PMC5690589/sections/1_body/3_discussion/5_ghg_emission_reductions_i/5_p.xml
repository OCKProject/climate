<p class="p">Finally, food loss, which was included in the computational analysis, but scarcely discussed in the current study, should not be neglected from a policy perspective. Despite the complexity of specific interventions to mitigate food loss throughout the food supply chain, a 20% reduction of food losses throughout production, storage and processing would imply a reduction of 6.0% in the production of food for the average Peruvian diet (i.e., 897 kg CO
