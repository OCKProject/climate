<p class="p">Several studies suggest that FAFH expenditure is highly dependent on socioeconomic groups, with wealthy households spending substantially more money on food in restaurants [

 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] show that Chinese households with the highest income spend 38% of their FAFH on meat products (51% if seafood is included) over a total of 1100 monetary units (i.e., Chinese yuan), whereas the lowest income households spend only 21% of FAFH expenditures on meats (27% including seafood) over a total of 164 monetary units. Consequently, although FAFH- and distribution-related GHG emissions were not included in the socioeconomic scenarios, we hypothesize that the inclusion of FAFH expenditure would further expand the gaps between the different income groups.
