<p class="p">In contrast to what has been observed on a geographical basis, differences between socioeconomic quintiles are very evident and significant from a final GHG emissions value perspective. For instance, in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Lima Metropolitana</italic> the GHG emissions of Q1 were 590 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq, whereas Q5 shows values above 1.38 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq. It should be noted, however, that these disparities are due, not only to differences in food consumption patterns, but also to differences in caloric intake. Nevertheless, if the GHG emissions per kcal are quantified, there is an increase from 1.18 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq in quintile 1 to 1.62 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq in quintile 5. The main reason for this difference is the fact that, for instance, the consumption of beef in the Peruvian capital is over seven times higher for quintile 5 (11.3 kg/year) as compared to quintile 1 (1.5 kg/year). Similar tendencies were found in a study conducted by Wilson et al. [
