<p class="p">When the results are contextualized and benchmarked to other diet-related GHG emissions studies, these comparisons, as in any other LCA study, should be interpreted with caution due to the wide array of methodological approaches, system boundaries or FUs considered [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188182.t007" class="xref">Table 7</xref> depicts the diet-related GHG emissions for other studies that assumed similar methodological assumptions. Thus, the average Peruvian diet is in the lower range of GHG emissions in comparison to developed countries. Interestingly, results for Peru are aligned to those obtained for vegan or vegetarian diets, which are usually reported as being more sustainable in terms of GHG emissions and other environmental impacts [
