<p class="p">Peruvian diets appear to be on the lower range of GHG emissions when compared to Western societies. However, the fact that residues in Peru are mainly disposed of in dumpsters, rather than in the very few (but increasing) landfills throughout the country, may imply a strong environmental impact towards the end-of-life of food products. For instance, a study conducted by Manfredi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] suggested that waste emissions in dumpsters can be as high as 1 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq per metric ton of waste, whereas in conventional landfills this value is reduced to roughly 300 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq/t. Therefore, in this context, the current transition that has been implemented in Peru from informal dumpsters to landfills may translate into important GHG emission reductions that would mitigate the expected increase in the carbon footprint of the average diet as computed in the current study [
