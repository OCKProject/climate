<p class="p">The GHG emissions related to the production of food purchased for household per capita presented relevant variations when analyzed from a socioeconomic perspective. For instance, for 
 <italic class="italic">Lima Metropolitana</italic> the GHG emissions per economic income shows a very strong correlation between higher economic standards and higher GHG emissions associated with the average diet, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188182.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. In fact, GHG emissions for quintile 5 (the wealthiest group) are 134% higher than for the poorest quintile. Similar trends are observable when urban environments are analyzed based on quintiles in other coastal cities. However, when Andean and Amazon cities are examined, the disparity between Q1 and Q5 increases substantially (326% for the former and 234% for the latter). Hence, in the case of Andean cities GHG emissions in Q1 added up to 372 kg CO
