<p class="p">GHG emissions linked to production of food purchased for the household represented 956 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq per year per capita for the average conditions of Peru. The main food category that contributed to this amount was red meat, representing 39% (369 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq), followed by poultry, 16% (151 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq), cereals, 11% (107 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq), and vegetables, 6.3% (60.5 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq). When the GHG emissions linked to FAFH production are added, the total footprint increases to 1.08 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq. Therefore, FAFH would represent approximately 12% of total GHG emissions from a food production perspective. Distribution was excluded from this scenario (see
