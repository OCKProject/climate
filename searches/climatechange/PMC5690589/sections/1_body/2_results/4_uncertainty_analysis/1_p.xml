<p class="p">Uncertainty analysis was conducted for the production of food consumed in the household. The results, which can be observed in Section A4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188182.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>, were computed to strengthen the robustness of the study and its applicability in policy support. As shown, the geometric variance was highest for mango, barley and flour (1.28), due to the higher uncertainty linked to geographical and temporal correlation. Hence, considering that these products show the highest standard deviations, and their carbon footprint is not calculated based on a Peruvian sample, it seems plausible that future LCA research in the food industry in Peru should include them. In contrast, products with a carbon footprint which has been calculated based on recent studies conducted in Peru, such as rice (1.04), and to a lesser extent fish products (1.10) and fresh milk (1.11), presented the lowest geometric variance. Lamb (1.16), pork, and beef (1.14) presented higher geometric variance than that of fish products. In a similar line to those products with the highest geometrical variance, red meat products, which were not calculated specifically for Peru, but rather for South America, merit future analysis considering the high GHG emissions related to them.
