<p class="p">Although the range of values may appear to be rather limited, important differences between cities can be identified when observing the relative contribution of each of the 15 food type groups that have been used. Notably, red meat products, represent more than 40% of the total impact in the cities of Chachapoyas (44%), Arequipa (41%), Cusco and Puno (40%), all Andean cities, whereas the lowest proportion of red meat-related emissions was observed in Cajamarca (Andes, 20%) and Pucallpa (Amazon, 25%). In addition, if all sources of animal protein are aggregated, these represent between 35% (Cajamarca) and 57% (Chachapoyas) of the total impact, although every city except Cajamarca presented values above 45%. Production of food consumed beyond the household ranged from 11% (112 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq) in Chiclayo (northern coast) to 22% in the city of Puerto Maldonado (398 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq). GHG emissions linked to product distribution to wholesalers were most noticeable in the cities of Puerto Maldonado and Pucallpa, in the Peruvian Amazon, and in the cities of Tumbes and Tacna along the Peruvian coast. These four cities have in common two key issues that influence this high value: a) low food production rates in their region; and, b) increased road distances to other areas within the country.
