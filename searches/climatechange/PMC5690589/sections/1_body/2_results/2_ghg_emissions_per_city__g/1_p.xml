<p class="p">The average GHG emissions for total food production in each of the cities assessed ranged from 966 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq in the city of Piura to 1.77 t in Cusco (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188182.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Cusco is located in the Andes, which was the area for which the average city showed the highest GHG emissions per capita (1.36 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq), whereas the average coastal city presented a value of 1.20 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq and the three cities analyzed in the Amazon basin showed an average value of 1.35 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq. However, it should be noted that whereas cities along the Peruvian coast showed a lower range of values, these were more significant in the Andes and the Amazon basin. For instance, in the case of the Amazon basin, the city of Puerto Maldonado presented an average footprint of 1.77 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq, whereas in Pucallpa the average value was 1.03 t CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq.
