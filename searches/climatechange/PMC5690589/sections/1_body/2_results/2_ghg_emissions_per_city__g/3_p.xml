<p class="p">When the average contribution of each food category is analyzed per natural area, coastal and Amazon cities show a considerably lower proportion of environmental impacts linked to the consumption of red meat (30% and 30%, respectively) as compared to Andean cities (35%). However, this difference is compensated, to a certain extent, by higher relative environmental impacts linked to poultry consumption in the former areas. It is interesting to note that substantial differences between areas are visible in terms of GHG emissions linked to the following food types: red meat, seafood, dairy products, cereals and poultry, suggesting important social differences in terms of food intake in the three natural areas.</p>
