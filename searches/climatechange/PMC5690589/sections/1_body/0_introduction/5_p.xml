<p class="p">In this context, Peru is one of the countries that have already ratified the Paris Accord, with a relatively ambitious objective of reducing environmental impacts by at least 31% in 2030 as compared to a business-as-usual scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Although in the case of Peru the GHG emissions linked directly to the food sector are yet to be computed in detail, studies elsewhere show that the food sector can represent up to 15–30% of national GHG emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Moreover, this proportion can reach up to 21–47% if land use changes are considered [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. GHG emissions linked to individual food products have been analyzed sparingly in Peru through a set of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. However, most of these have focused on the GHG emissions linked to the production of fishmeal and fish oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], agro-exports to other continents [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], or alcoholic beverages [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In fact, only a few studies have focused on the production of nationally-consumed food products, including dairy products [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] and fruits [
