 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], eradication of malnourishment and hunger is considered a more important priority in the short- and mid-term according to the new 17 Sustainable Development Goals [
 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A certain degree of relationship between the two goals has been identified to the extent that climate change may constitute a potential obstacle towards a world with zero hunger [

 <xref rid="pone.0188182.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] note that basic food products in the Peruvian diet, such as wheat and rice, and to a lesser extent, potatoes, may experience significant production reductions in the Andean region by 2030 due to climate change.
