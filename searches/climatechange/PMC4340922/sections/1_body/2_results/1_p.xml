<p class="p">The path (mediation) model was estimated using STATA’s (StataCorp) SEM software. As recommended by Preacher and Hayes [
 <xref rid="pone.0118489.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], significance of effects and model parameters was assessed using bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals (the data were resampled 1,000 times). Furthermore, according to Little’s MCAR test, part of the data (approx. 8% of the sample) was missing, but not completely at random. As a result, the model was estimated using a Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) procedure [
 <xref rid="pone.0118489.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and adjusted for important covariates, including gender, education, age and political party. Using commonly accepted criteria for model evaluation [
 <xref rid="pone.0118489.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], the fit of the overall model structure is considered acceptable; χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (6) = 27.38, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> / df = 4.56, CFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.06 (90% CI: 0.04–0.08). On average, being in one of the treatment groups (vs. the control group) significantly increases respondents’ estimate of the scientific consensus (by 12.80%). Moreover, a change in a respondent’s estimate of the scientific consensus significantly influences the belief that climate change is happening, human-caused, and the extent to which they worry about the issue (note that belief in climate change and human causation also directly influence level of “worry”). Changes in these factors, in turn, significantly predict support for public action on climate change. As hypothesized, the effect of the treatment (i.e. increased belief in the scientific consensus) on the expressed need for public action is fully mediated by the intervening variables (i.e., key beliefs about climate change). Similarly, the effect of the treatment on the key-belief measures is fully mediated by perceived scientific agreement.
