<p class="p">Although ensemble means revealed global biomass declines across all emission scenarios (

 </xref>), there was considerable variation among MEMs and ESMs (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). Interestingly, the variability in projected biomass changes among ESMs was of similar magnitude to that among MEMs (

  <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 </xref>), suggesting similar levels of uncertainty associated with physical and biological models. Since the field of global ecosystem modeling is relatively new compared with Earth system modeling (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), one might have expected higher variability across MEMs. Other MIPs also found that uncertainties in both ESMs and climate impact models contribute to overall projection uncertainty, with similar contributions from ESMs and global hydrological models (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), yet much higher uncertainty in global crop and vegetation models than ESMs (
