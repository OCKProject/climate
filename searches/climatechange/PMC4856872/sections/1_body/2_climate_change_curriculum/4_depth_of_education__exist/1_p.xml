 </sup> Parallels between climate change and clinical practice, biomedical science and public health include: i) evidence-based practice: critical appraisal of climate change and health research; ii) heat-related illness pathophysiology: examining heat stroke and physiological risk; iii) infectious disease principles: examining climate-related shifts in vector borne disease; iv) statistics and epidemiology: exploring associations between respiratory disease and pollution; v) health as a human right: exploring challenges such as sustainable development and intergenerational equity; and vi) the value of multidisciplinary perspectives: appraising climate risks such as infectious disease and malnutrition from various angles, for example, agricultural and zoonotic studies
