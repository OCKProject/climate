 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). First, doctors need to be able to manage climate-related illness, engage in local health promotion and prevention, and provide healthcare in a responsible and sustainable way. Secondly, teaching about climate change offers an avenue to improve public health literacy and eco-health literacy, which are essential to building a climate-resilient society and health-sector. Thirdly, climate change can be used to illustrate and deepen existing learning, and strengthen graduate attributes.
