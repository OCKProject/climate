<p class="p">The links between climate change and health present a compelling argument for medical education to prepare doctors for health sector mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

 </sup> However, it is not possible to prescribe a single climate change curriculum that will have international applicability. Climate change health impacts will be influenced by pre-existing health status and social conditions, as well as exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity to climate change. An added complexity is the uncertainty around regionally specific and disease specific climate change risks.

 </sup> Although some risks exhibit clear international trends, such as an increase in frequency and intensity of heatwaves, other risks, such as the distribution of infectious disease, are less predictable.

 </sup> A climate change curriculum therefore needs to evolve with emerging evidence and local needs. Yet there are certain concepts and skills that could be considered core learning objectives.
