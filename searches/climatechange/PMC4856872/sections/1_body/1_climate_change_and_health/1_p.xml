 </sup> Importantly, these boundaries do not define tipping points in the planetary system, but mark a zone of increasing uncertainty around risk. Climate change is one domain which has transgressed the planetary boundary into increasing risk and uncertainty. Like alterations to the biosphere, climate change is of particular concern as it risks a sudden major change in the earthâ€™s environment which could be catastrophic.
