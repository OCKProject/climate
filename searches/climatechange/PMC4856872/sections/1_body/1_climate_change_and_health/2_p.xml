 <italic class="italic">Immediate and direct risks</italic> include heatwaves, extreme weather events and altered air quality.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> The increasing intensity and frequency of extremes have the potential to overwhelm adaptive capacity and cause considerable premature mortality, as was evident in the 2010 Pakistani flood and 2003 European heatwave. 
 <italic class="italic">Indirect risks</italic> to health occur through changes to ecosystems and biophysical systems, affecting infectious disease distribution, crop yields, fish stocks, aeroallergens, water quality and flows, and bacterial growth rates.

  <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> Ultimately, climatic shifts cause stress and disrupt livelihoods, leading to 
 <italic class="italic">deferred and diffuse risks</italic> to mental and physical health. For mental health: extreme events can cause stress and trauma; and existential concerns about humanity and the planet can cause anxiety and depression.

  <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> Climate change poses further risks to health through increases in 
 <italic class="italic">civil conflict and social instability</italic> and forced migration,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20-22</xref>
 </sup> potentially dwarfing existing refugee crises.
