 </sup> Embedding climate change in existing teaching – such as in a case-based tutorial on heatstroke – deepens and contextualises learning, strongly endorses climate change health concerns, and promotes permanence of the curriculum change. Conversely, stand-alone teaching enables students to conceptualise climate change and health in its entirety, and to adopt thinking styles that suit conceptual learning rather than factual-reductionist learning. Climate change and health can be taught from a variety of perspectives. A survey of UK medical schools found that climate change was taught mostly by public health specialists, but also by clinicians, ethicists, epidemiologists and climate scientists.
