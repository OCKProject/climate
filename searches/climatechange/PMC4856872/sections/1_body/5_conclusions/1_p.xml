<p class="p">Climate change is serious issue threatening the viability of the ecosystems and socio-economic fabric sustaining human health. This paper has illustrated a rationale for including a climate change curriculum in medical education: for climate change preparedness; to promote public health and eco-health literacy; and to deepen learning and strengthen graduate attributes. This paper has proposed learning objectives and explored methods for teaching and assessment. Medical schools are encouraged to become leaders in this field to catalyse and support a strong public health response to climate change in order to secure a safe and sustainable future.</p>
