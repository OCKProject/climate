<p class="p">Plots were established at the three sites along the urban to rural transect to compare

 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> responses to glucose additions. For these experiments, soil collars measuring 20 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height were set 24 hours before sampling in a plot measuring approximately 25 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at each site along the transect. Treatments included a control (water only) and four levels of glucose concentration: 5, 15, 30 and 90 g/L. Each treatment was replicated four times for a total of 20 samples per site. 200 mL of water or glucose solution were applied to each collar, and soil respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer (LI-8100, Licor Biosciences) at 1, 8 and 24 hours after addition of water or glucose solution.
