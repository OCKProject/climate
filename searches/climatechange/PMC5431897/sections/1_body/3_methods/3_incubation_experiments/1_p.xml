<p class="p">Soils were collected from the three sites along the urban to rural transect as well as the nine N addition plots at Heshan Station to perform laboratory incubations to explore the response of soil respiration to glucose addition under controlled temperature and moisture conditions. Five field replicates were collected from each plot. Each field replicate was composed of approximately ten soil cores collected from 0–15 cm of the mineral soil layer. The soils were brought back to the lab and air dried for 3 to 5 days at room temperature. The soils were then sieved to 2 mm and homogenized. Before drying, an aliquot from each field replicate was placed in the freezer for nitrate and ammonium analysis. An additional aliquot from the dried and sieved samples was used for total organic C and total N analysis. Soil chemical analysis was performed by the Key Laboratory of Vegetation Restoration and Management for Degraded Ecosystems at the South China Botanical Gardens, Chinese Academy of Sciences using the copper cadmium reduction-diazotization coupling method for nitrate, potassium chloride leaching-indophenol blue method for ammonium, Kjeldahl method for total nitrogen and external heating using potassium dichromate oxidation method for total organic carbon

 </sup>. Water holding capacity (100%) was determined by the gravimetric water content of soil placed in a filter funnel and saturated with deionized water, then allowed to drain for two hours.
