<p class="p">Statistical significance for treatment effects for the laboratory incubations were determined by 2- and 3-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using the (R version 3.2.5). Assumptions of normality and homoscedacity were tested with the Shapiro-Wilks and Bartlettâ€™s tests, respectively. When these assumptions were not met, the Box-Cox family of transformations was used. Analysis of field measurements used linear mixed-effects model by maximum likelihood with time as a random factor followed by Tukey Contrasts with Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons using the lme4 and multcomp packages in R version 3.3.3. Linear regressions for the relationship between kM and available soil nitrogen were performed in Matlab (2015b).</p>
