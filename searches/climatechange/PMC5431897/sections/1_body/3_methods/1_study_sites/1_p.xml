<p class="p">The study was located in Guangdong Province of South China. The area is under the influence of a subtropical monsoon climate with alternating wet and dry seasons, and has undergone rapid urban expansion since the 1970s. Three sites were selected along an urban to rural transect in Guangdong Province in southern China to capture an anthropogenic N deposition gradient

 </sup>. The urban to rural transect started in the urban site of Pu Gang in the South China Botanic Gardens, then the suburban site of Lou Gang, and ended in the Shimentai Nature Reserve in Yingde County. All sites were located in late successional evergreen broadleaf forests with at least 50 years since disturbance. All soils were latosolic red. Published nitrogen deposition data from these sites reveal higher than expected nitrogen deposition in the rural site (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Increased canopy interception of N deposition in urban sites may explain the gradient in soil available N seen in this study
