 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The incubation results from the urban to rural transect soils showed a significant increase in the Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> of V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> with increasing N (p &lt; 0.05), but no relationship between soil N and the Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> of kM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). N also increased R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> in the high N compared to the low and mid N treatments for all C concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Alternatively, soils from the N addition plots did not exhibit differences in Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> of V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> or kM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). For both the urban to rural transect and the N addition plots, there was a divergent response of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> Q10 to glucose addition, with a general decrease from ambient carbon to 5 g/L glucose, followed by an asymptotic increase from 5 g/L through 90 g/L glucose (Fig.
