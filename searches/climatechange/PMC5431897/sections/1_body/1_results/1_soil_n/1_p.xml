<p class="p">Soils from the urban to rural transect sites spanned a range of available N (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> plus NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) from 14.7 to 71.4 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). While total N availability was significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between the rural and urban sites and the rural and suburban sites, the urban and suburban sites were not significantly different. For simplicity, the urban site will hereafter be referred to as “Low N”, the suburban site as “Mid N” and the rural site as “High N”. The Heshan Station N addition plots ranged from 30.3 to 49.6 mg N kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> soil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). While there were no significant differences between plots for ammonium or nitrate individually, total N for the control plot was significantly less than the 50 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> plot, but not significantly different from the plot receiving 100 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> plot (at p &lt; 0.05). To maintain consistency, the N addition plots have been relabeled to reflect differences in soil available N, similar to the urban to rural transect. The plots receiving 50 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> presented the highest soil total available N and will therefore be referred to as “High N”, the plots receiving 100 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> will be referred to as “Mid N”, and the control plots will be referred to as “Low N”.
