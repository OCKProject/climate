<p class="p">The Michaelis-Menten parameter kM also demonstrated a general pattern of decline with increasing available N across all soils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Results of the field experiment for the urban to rural transect demonstrated the decrease in R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> with increasing soil N, evident at all sampling times (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> was measured at 1, 8 and 24 hours after glucose additions for fitting the Michaelis-Menten parameters V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and kM, which both increased with time since wetting (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The laboratory incubation experiment with the soils from the urban to rural transect further allowed for manipulation of temperature to understand the temperature sensitivity of kM. Generally, kM declined from the low N to the high N soils across all temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Furthermore, in the laboratory incubation of soils from the N addition plots, kM was negatively related with measured soil N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) at 25 and 31 °C (p &lt; 0.05). Also apparent from the temperature manipulations, kM was highly temperature dependent and this relationship was non-linear.
