<p class="p">For all measurements, soil CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production generally decreased with increasing soil extractable N levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Field measurements along the urban-to-rural transect showed decreasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production with increasing soil available N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,d</xref>; p &lt; 0.05). The laboratory incubation results for the urban to rural transect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b,e</xref>) showed decreased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in the Mid N soils compared to the Low N soils at both ambient and saturating C concentrations (p = 0.04 and 0.0004, respectively). However, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in the High N soils was not significantly different from the low N soils (p = 0.2 and 0.4 for ambient and V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, respectively). In the N addition plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,f</xref>), CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was decreased in the High N soils compared to the Low N soils (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.003 for ambient and V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, respectively). In the urban to rural transect, the response of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> to soil N was the same at both ambient soil C concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>) and at saturating C concentrations (V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d,e</xref>). However, in the N addition plots, the response at saturating C concentrations was different from ambient C concentrations. While there was no difference between the Low N and Mid N soils at ambient concentrations (p = 0.1), there was an increase in V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> from Low N to Mid N (p = 0.006).
