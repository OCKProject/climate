<p class="p">In conclusion, our results provide needed experimental support for theoretical relationships between R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub>, temperature and N, and highlight the benefit of substrate-based kinetics for improving understanding of soil biogeochemical processes, particularly R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> temperature and N sensitivity. Although increasing soil N can decrease R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub>, interactions between N and temperature could offset this response and result in greater loss of soil C stores. Anthropogenic activities have increased N inputs to terrestrial systems by about 46 Tg N y

Developing a mechanistic understanding of soil feedbacks to the combined anthropogenic influences of climate change and nitrogen deposition in these systems is critical to develop predictive abilities for future climate scenarios, and substrate-based kinetics provide a valuable tool to help accomplish that goal.
