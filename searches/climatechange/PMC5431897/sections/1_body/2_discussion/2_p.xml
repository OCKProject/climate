 </sup>. Here we show the first experimental estimation of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> Michaelis-Menten parameters for decomposition of a labile C source in whole soil. The laboratory incubations demonstrated positive temperature sensitivity for both V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and kM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), which indicate a non-linear relationship with temperature similar to Arrhenius kinetics. This positive temperature response of both V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and kM confirms the potential for a canceling effect at low substrate concentrations

 </sup>. However, the C availability influence on temperature sensitivity produced a divergent response in almost every soil. Compared to the control treatment that received no labile C addition, there was a decrease in Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> with initial C addition and then an increase with subsequent increasing C addition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b,d</xref>), which indicates that both the C quality and the C availability hypotheses are working together. While using a general enzymatic approach to represent R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> necessarily simplifies the complex metabolic pathways and physical structure of the soil, results from this study demonstrate that these theoretical simplifications for modeling efforts are useful for whole soils and in field conditions. Such an integrated metabolic framework suggests a pathway to improve soil C modeling and predictions of soil C storage under future climate and nitrogen pollution scenarios.
