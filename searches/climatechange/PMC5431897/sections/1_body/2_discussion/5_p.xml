<p class="p">Across all experiments in this study, increasing soil N resulted in a reduction in the Michaelis-Menten parameter, kM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and we interpret this as a further indicator of dynamic CUE influence on R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub>. In traditional enzyme assays, kM represents the inverse of an enzyme’s affinity for its substrate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. In the context of this study, kM allows for an estimation of efficiency as it represents the balance between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production for a particular amount of substrate addition. The decrease in kM suggests a more efficient use of labile C with increasing N, contrary to the expected view for CUE. However, application of kM to CUE in this study would require that microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme production remain constant across treatments as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was the only parameter measured. While we only measured CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production, many studies have shown decreases in microbial biomass with N additions

 </sup>. Alternatively, the empirical kM estimates from this study could be interpreted in the more traditional sense as a shift in enzyme specificity. N addition can result in shifts in extracellular enzyme production that are more targeted at C decomposition and therefore more efficient rather than enzymes directed at both C and N acquisition

 </sup>. Regardless, the consistent decrease in kM with increasing soil N availability across all soils in this study presents a useful tool for modeling R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> dynamics under anthropogenic nitrogen deposition.
