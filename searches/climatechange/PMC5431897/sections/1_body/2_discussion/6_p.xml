<p class="p">Importantly, we also found that N availability can influence the sensitivity of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> to both temperature and C substrate availability, presenting a potential for interaction between N deposition and climate change. N addition caused a significant increase in the temperature sensitivity of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> in the urban to rural transect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a,b</xref>). The N influence on temperature sensitivity of the Michaelis-Menten parameters was limited to V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and not kM Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>. This could result in a dampening of the canceling effect and therefore greater temperature sensitivity at lower substrate concentrations under N deposition, which is supported by results from the urban to rural transect demonstrating greater Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> at the high N site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Furthermore, the influence of N on kM in the N addition plots was magnified at higher temperatures. A decrease in kM would result in an increase in R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> at less than saturating substrate concentrations. As C is usually not saturating in most natural settings the decrease in V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> could be of less significance than the decrease in kM in terms of annual C emissions.
