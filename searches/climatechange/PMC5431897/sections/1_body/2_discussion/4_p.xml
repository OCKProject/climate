<p class="p">While our results demonstrated a general decrease in R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> with increasing N availability, differences between field results and lab measurements may reflect the influence of autotrophic respiration. Some studies have demonstrated a disproportionate influence of N on soil root and mycorrhizal respiration compared to heterotrophic respiration

 </sup>. This would explain the strong response in the field experiments, but a less consistent response in lab incubations. Furthermore, in the lab incubation for the N addition plots (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>) the divergent response of V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> to N availability would reflect the isolation of heterotrophic respiration, highlighting the importance of microbial CUE, which was obscured by the autotrophic response in the field results. This heterotrophic response might be harder to discern in the urban to rural transect where it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in plant community composition. However, overall there was a consistent decrease in R
