 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> through dynamic carbon-use efficiency (CUE) of soil microorganisms in order to adjust metabolic activity to better fit inconsistent resource availability

 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> is dependent on the stoichiometry between C and N. When C is limiting compared to N, microbes will increase their CUE, thereby decreasing R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub>. Alternatively, when C is abundant compared to N, decreased CUE results in increased R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub>. When both resources are abundant, metabolic activity and growth are at a maximum. Initial laboratory tests have demonstrated R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> dynamics consistent with dynamic CUE in arid and semi-arid environments
