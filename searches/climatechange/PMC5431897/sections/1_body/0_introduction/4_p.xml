<p class="p">In addressing this uncertainty, we examined how soils from a subtropical moist forest in Guangdong Province, China respond to increasing soil N availability. This region in the highly industrialized Pearl River Delta has experienced rapid land use change and the urbanized areas, including Guangzhou, have become a large source of N deposition to the outlying forest ecosystems

Additionally, experimental N addition plots were used to compare differences in soil available N while holding other plant community and soil characteristics constant. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to evaluate how nitrogen deposition may influence R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> in this region and potential interactions with warming. We asked: (1) How does soil N availability influence the response of R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> to labile C addition? (2) How does labile C addition affect the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, and (3) Does soil N availability influence this temperature response? We hypothesized that N availability would influence R
 <sub class="sub">soil</sub> based on C:N stoichiometry, following the dynamic CUE hypothesis, and that temperature sensitivity would be mediated through the Michaelis-Menten parameters, V
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and kM.
