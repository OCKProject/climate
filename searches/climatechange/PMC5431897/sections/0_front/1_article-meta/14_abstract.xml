 <p class="p">China experiences some of the highest rates of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition globally, with further increases projected. Understanding of soil feedbacks to the combined anthropogenic influences of climate change and nitrogen deposition in these systems is critical to improve predictive abilities for future climate scenarios. Here we used a Michaelis-Menten substrate-based kinetics framework to explore how soil CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> production (R
  <sub class="sub">soil</sub>) responds to changes in temperature and available soil nitrogen (N) by combining field experiments with laboratory manipulations from sites experiencing elevated rates of anthropogenic N deposition but varying in soil N availabiltiy. The temperature sensitivity of R
  <sub class="sub">soil</sub> was strongly influenced by labile C additions. Furthermore, estimation of the temperature response of the Michaelis-Menten parameters supports the use of substrate-based kinetics in modeling efforts. Results from both field and laboratory experiments demonstrated a general decrease in R
  <sub class="sub">soil</sub> with increasing soil available N that was variably dependent on carbon (C) availability. Both the field and the laboratory measurements demonstrated a consistent decrease in the Michaelis-Menten parameter kM with increasing soil available N, indicating an increase in the efficiency of soil C decomposition with increasing N. Furthermore, these results provide evidence of interactions between N deposition and temperature sensitivity, which could influence C storage under combined anthropogenic global change drivers.
