  <p class="p">Species richness in Bolognaâ€™s different urban areas and correlation with paving materials. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) NMDS analysis showing the distribution of transects (black dots) according to the presence of different paving materials (empty crossed-squares). Black dots represent several overlapped transects with similar features. Numbers represent the average richness and (in brackets) the amount of transects. Blu colour, HBA; green, NBA; red, OCC. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) PCA analysis showing the grouping of species according to their presence in the different building areas. Several species are overlapped in each group of black dots, each dot represents a single species. Dark green circle: species growing exclusively in green spaces. Orange dots represent typical species of each habitat (see text for details). PC2 vs PC3 was used to allow better species grouping. In all the figures, HBA: historical building area, NBA: new building area, OCC: old city centre.
