<p id="Par12" class="p">The study area taken into consideration in the present paper corresponds to Bologna’s historical city centre identified as the part of the city formerly surrounded by the walls built in the XIV century. This particularly restricted study area was selected in order to allow the comparison of the data acquired in “Salinitro

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>, a study meant to describe the species occurring in the city and their habitats. Making a comparison between Bologna’s current flora and the one present over 120 years ago is certainly not an easy task, in particular due to the different methodologies followed for data collection and the changes of plant scientific names that occurred over the years. In fact, in “Salinitro

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, data were generated from direct observations based on a network of transects that uniformly covered the study area. In this way it was possible to link every observation to a specific locality, allowing for a spatial analysis of the urban flora. The data described in “Gabelli”

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup> were instead a mix of direct observations, done by the author himself, and reports by two other previous authors, without following a scientific sampling methodology. Species localities in the ancient study were rarely recorded (i.e. with the name of a street or an ancient city door), instead most species were described as common in certain habitats (i.e. along the roads, in paved areas, in gardens, etc.) or defined as widespread in the whole city. Plant names cited in the ancient study were often outdated (not used anymore in modern plant systematics) and, even though common names were not reported in “Gabelli”
