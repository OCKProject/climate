<p id="Par17" class="p">To determine how species richness in different building areas was influenced by paving materials, and which materials mainly characterized each type of building area, a non-parametric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed (software

 </sup>). Manhattan distance was used for computation, convergence was reached after 100 iterations and the stress of the optimal solutions was 0.0397. To analyse the distribution of species according to their presence or absence in different urban building areas, a PCA analysis was performed. The G-test (software
