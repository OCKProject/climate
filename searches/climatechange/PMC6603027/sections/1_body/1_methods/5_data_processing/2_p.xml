<p id="Par16" class="p">A standardization of the two datasets with respect to botanical names and geographical localities was performed. All the historical plant names were linked to modern ones using the PlantList website (

No ambiguities were evidenced in correlating old and current plant names. When possible, the city’s historical plant distribution was inferred by linking the names of the old toponyms to modern ones. Species were considered present in specific ancient habitats (i.e, road sides, gardens, etc.) when they were also detected in the corresponding modern habitat. Plants defined as common or widespread in the 1894 city were also taken into consideration for the whole modern city area. Despite all efforts to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the ancient flora, the lack of detailed information in the “Gabelli, 1894” dataset did not allow a spatial comparison with the “Salinitro
