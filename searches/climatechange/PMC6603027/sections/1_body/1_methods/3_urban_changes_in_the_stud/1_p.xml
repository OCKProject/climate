<p id="Par10" class="p">At the end of the 19th century, Bologna still looked like a medieval city (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>) with a complete circle of walls (built around the XIV century), narrow roads mainly made of packed-earth and very low vehicular traffic. Public urban parks were almost completely absent, while large agricultural areas (nowadays completely disappeared) were present within the historical city centre located inside the walls. Bare brick walls were common while roads were mainly unpaved or cobblestone-covered, offering the perfect conditions for plant settling. Natural local materials were used, like wood and gypsum in buildings and pebbles or trachyte slabs in main streets. In this urban context, the first complete study on the urban flora of Bologna was carried out by Lucio Gabelli in 1894

 </sup>. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, the city was completely renovated due to the large industrial expansion and the increase of the urban population. The ancient XIV century walls were almost completely demolished together with the moat and embankment surrounding them. All the main streets of the city were enlarged, rectified and paved, and the agricultural areas within the city centre were replaced by new buildings. Local materials were replaced and at present, streets are covered with asphalt, trachyte plates and porphyry cubes. Gypsum and wood lost importance as building materials, while brick walls were mostly plastered. Following the Second World War, the city experienced a great expansion outside its historical core, eliminating all the rural areas still present close to the city. To counterbalance the lack of green areas, tree lines were planted and small parks were created within the city centre (
