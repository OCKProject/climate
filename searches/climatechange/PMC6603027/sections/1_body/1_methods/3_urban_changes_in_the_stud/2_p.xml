<p id="Par11" class="p">Nowadays, Bologna’s historical city centre corresponds to the part of the city formerly surrounded by the ancient city walls of the XIV century. In this area, three zones with different building construction types are recognizable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). The new building area (NBA) was created after the Second World War and consists of tall buildings and wide streets with scarce vegetation mostly confined to public parks. The old city centre (OCC), located in the central part of the city, inherited part of the roman and medieval structures. It consists of narrow streets (except those widened at the beginning of the 1900s) with 3–4-storey buildings and lacks public green areas. Finally, in the southern and eastern part of the city, there is an area with historical buildings (HBA), ranging from XVIII century palaces to modern houses largely endowed with internal courtyards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). This area, though poor in public parks, is quite green with generally wide streets.
