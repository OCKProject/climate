The study reported measured temperatures and precipitations in the period 1961–2012, pointing out that since the 1990s an average increase of about 2 °C during the summer period occurred. This rise in temperature led to a failure of the hydro-climatic balance, so that the precipitation-evapotranspiration ratio has been negative since 1985 for most of the years. Since the 1970s, the presence of the urban heat island effect (U.H.I.) in the city of Bologna was also assessed, showing a general increase of 2.7 °C of winter temperatures in the city centre compared to the countryside
