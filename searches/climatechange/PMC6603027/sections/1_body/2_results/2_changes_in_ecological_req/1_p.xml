<p id="Par20" class="p">When comparing Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs), associated to the two datasets several interesting differences were revealed. The comparison was performed by taking into consideration light (L), moisture (F), temperature (T), reaction (R), continentality (K) and nutrients (N) EIVs, while the salinity (S) index was not included in the analysis since most of the species recorded in both studies were from non-saline soils. Differences between the “Gabelli, 1894” and “Salinitro
