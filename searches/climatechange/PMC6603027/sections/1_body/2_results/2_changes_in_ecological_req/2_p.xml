<p id="Par21" class="p">K, R, N indexes did not show significant changes (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.456, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.345, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.746 respectively) between the two datasets and, therefore, they were not included in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. The complete set of data is available in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The light (L) index pattern of the two whole floristic datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>) indicates that shade-tolerant and intermediate species (categories 1–5) experienced an increase between 1 to 3%, moderate heliophilous species (categories 8 and 9) showed a strong decrease (respectively, 6 and 2%) while highly heliophilous species (category 11) experienced an increase of 2.4% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.053). These general changes were even more emphasized when lost and acquired species (of the modern flora) were compared, with exception of category 11 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.032) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4D</xref>). The moisture (F) index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref>) showed no significant changes in drought-resistant species (categories 1 to 3), while a 3.7% decrease was observed in category 4. Intermediate categories (6–8) increased by between 4.7 and 3.5%, while no significant changes were observed for hygrophilous species (categories 9–10) and moisture adaptable species (category X). Overall, the changes in F index were associated with a 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value of 0.081. On the other end, when the moisture indexes of lost and acquired species of the present flora were compared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4F</xref>), a 4% decrease of drought-resistant species (categories 2–4), and an enrichment (2.7 to 7%) of intermediate tolerant species (categories 5 to 7) were found (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.029). The temperature (T) index in both studies starts from category 4 as no plants tolerant to very low temperatures (e.g. alpine or sub-alpine species) were or are actually present in the Bologna study area. The analysis of T indexes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4C</xref>) indicates that microthermal and mesothermal species (categories 4 to 6) did not change in 120 years. On the contrary, macrothermal species increased by 3% (categories 7 to 10) at the expense of plants adapted to a wide range of temperature. In fact, the number of species belonging to category X halved in 120 years (from 16.8 to 8.5%) (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.033). A similar pattern was found when comparing lost and acquired species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4E</xref>) (p = 0.024).
