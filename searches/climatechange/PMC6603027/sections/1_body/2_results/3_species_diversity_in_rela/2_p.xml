  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> is ascribable to green areas, which alone contain 418 species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref>). Among the three different building areas identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>), new building area (NBA), old city centre (OCC), and historical building area (HBA), several differences were observed regarding the presence of green spaces and the type of flooring used that affect floristic richness and composition. The presence of green spaces adjacent to streets, such as gardens, flowerbeds or tree-lines, was quite different: 40.6% in NBA, 36.2% in HBA and only 12.7% in OCC. The most widespread paving for HBA and NBA was asphalt, while trachyte plates were more abundant in OCC. The presence of porphyry cubes was almost constant among the three building areas, while cobblestone paving was scarcely represented (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5B</xref>). The influence of paving materials on total species richness was shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>. Transects richest in species were primarily characterized by the presence of green spaces and asphalt, while, on the contrary, those showing porphyry cubes and trachyte slabs were the poorest. Accordingly, decreasing values of species richness were detected for HBA, NBA and OCC containing on the whole 244, 226 and 132 species, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref>). Differences in structure and materials present in each type of building area not only affected species richness but also led to the differentiation into three different sub-floras (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6B</xref>). Eight species were exclusive to OCC, among which roof plants, like 
 <italic class="italic">Polypodium interjectum</italic> Shivas and 
 <italic class="italic">Sedum dasyphyllum</italic> L.; 58 species were only found in HBA, among which many ornamental garden plants, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alcea rosea</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Buxus sempervirens</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Elaeagnus pungens</italic> Thunb.; 47 species grew exclusively in NBA, among which some exotic species of sunny places, like 
 <italic class="italic">Dysphania pumilio</italic> (R. Br.) Mosyakin &amp; Clemants, 
 <italic class="italic">Delosperma cooperi</italic> (Hook.f.) L. Bolus and 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium virginicum</italic> L.; and 159 species were only detected in green areas, among them many rare native species of shady habitats, like 
 <italic class="italic">Scilla bifolia</italic> L., 
 <italic class="italic">Silene flos-cuculi</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Vinca minor</italic> L. A large number of species (39.7%) were shared between two or more building areas, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Mahonia japonica</italic> (Thumb.) DC., 
 <italic class="italic">Papaver rhoeas</italic> L. in NBA and HBA and 
 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus altissima</italic> (Mill.) Swingle, 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago major</italic> L., and 
 <italic class="italic">Stellaria media</italic> L. (Vill.) present in all three building areas.
