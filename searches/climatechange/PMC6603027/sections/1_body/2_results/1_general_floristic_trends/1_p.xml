 </sup>, a big increase in the number of recorded taxa could be detected. Recorded botanical families increased from 41 to 101, genera from 138 to 306 and species from 176 to 477 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). In 120 years, the number of alien species has more than doubled, from less than 12.5% to the current 30.1% (i.e. from 22 to 144 species of the respective total amounts) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). A large turnover in species was detected, with only 113 species still in common between the two floras; the Sørensen similarity index value was 0.35, indicating a mean 65% of species turnover in 120 years. Over this time period some of the most represented botanical families (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>) have changed. Apart from 
 <italic class="italic">Asteraceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Poaceae</italic> species that resulted the most abundant in both floras, those of the 
 <italic class="italic">Fabaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> families decreased. In contrast, the 
 <italic class="italic">Asparagaceae</italic> family, not recorded in the old study, entered in the top ten, while the 
 <italic class="italic">Rosaceae</italic> family underwent a significant increase of 68%. The species newly introduced in Bologna’s contemporary flora

 </sup> (mostly alien ornamental) belong to different botanical families, with the result that 30% of the current botanical families are represented by only one species (data not shown). A comparison between the life forms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2D</xref>) of the ancient and present floras pointed out a noticeable increase in the incidence of phanerophytes (from 6 to 25%) and geophytes (from 4 to 12%). Therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased (from 49 to 32% and from 36 to 26%, respectively) while no change was found for chamaephytes (around 5%). In addition, the chorological spectra deeply changed between the ancient and the modern floras (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), evidencing a doubling of naturalised (from 13.6 to 28.9%) and stenomediterranean species (from the 3.4 to the 6.5%). As a consequence, all the other classes experienced a decrease in comparison with “Gabelli, 1894”, in particular the eurasiatic species (from 10.8 to 5.9%).
