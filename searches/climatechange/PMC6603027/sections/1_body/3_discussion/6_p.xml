<p id="Par29" class="p">The positive correlation between species richness and green areas was further confirmed by the progressive impoverishment of urban biodiversity going from HBA to NBA to OCC, in accordance with the decreasing presence of green areas. Similar patterns were reported for the city of Rome

 </sup>, where the historical centre (approximately corresponding to Bologna’s OCC) and new 1950–1980 building developments (similar to NBA) showed the poorest levels of plant diversity. Our findings also support the thesis that paving materials differently contributed to enhance or decrease street floristic richness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>), suggesting that building materials could have played an important role in characterizing current urban flora. Furthermore, previous results on Bologna

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> showed a negative correlation between floristic diversity and street width (generally higher in NBA and HBA with respect to OCC) suggesting that the larger modern streets have played an important role in increasing plant richness coupled with the creation of new green spaces.
