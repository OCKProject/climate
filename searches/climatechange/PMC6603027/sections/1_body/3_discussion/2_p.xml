 </sup> worldwide, the present results point out that the total number of species increased dramatically over a 120 years timespan, in particular, the number of alien species which doubled (from 12.5 to 30.1% of total species) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). The species number increase seems to be a common trend in many urban areas

 </sup>, nonetheless the large number of species detected in “Salinitro 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 2018” could also be partly due to an underestimation of total species richness in “Gabelli. 1894”. However, the recorded amount of alien species was in line with European and world averages, e.g. 25.2%
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup> and 28%
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. A similar increase was also found when higher taxa levels (genera and families) were analysed and, in general, the high diversity in cities could be ascribed to the large variety of urban microhabitats and, above all, to the human voluntary and non-voluntary introduction of species for ornamental purposes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. In fact, the cultivation of ornamental plants for leisure and decoration represents the primary factor contributing to the increase of neophytes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>

 </sup>. The increase of 
 <italic class="italic">Asparagaceae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rosaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Oleaceae</italic> could be mainly ascribed to the naturalisation of cultivated species. Interestingly, 65% of recently lost species are represented by indigenous ones, as previously detected also in other cities such as Zürich
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup> (about 60%). As a confirmation of previous considerations, the Sørensen similarity index, indicating the species turnover and calculated between Bologna’s ancient and modern flora, is significantly lower (0.35) compared to other cities like Zürich, Brussels and Plzen

 </sup> (on average 0.80). This large species turnover detected in Bologna over 120 years may reflect the urbanistic changes the city centre underwent from the beginning of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, like the disappearance of cultivated fields and medieval walls, which dramatically reduced the presence of green areas in the city
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>

 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L., and cultivated crops like

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A similar reduction in field species has previously been observed in other cities like, e.g., Brussels
