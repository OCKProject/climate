<p id="Par28" class="p">Analysing the temperature EIV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4C,F</xref>), an increase in mesothermal and macrothermal (categories 7 to 10) species and a concomitant decrease of tolerant species (category X), was evidenced. A similar trend has been found in most of the cities previously investigated, in agreement with a global temperature increase (more evident in urban environments) in the last decades

 </sup>. Key players of these biodiversity changes are many Mediterranean (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia therebinthus</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Cupressus sempervirens</italic> L.) and alien thermophilic species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cooperi</italic> (Hook.f.) L.Bolus and 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorophytum comosum</italic> (Thunb.) Jacques), which in recent years have started to survive the winter given the milder temperatures. The tropicalization of the flora is, in fact, supported by the U.H.I.’s in many European cities

 </sup>. Moreover, the strong decrease of species with a wider tolerance (category X) was confirmed by a shift toward extreme temperatures, especially in summer. In the present data, the maximum plant species richness was detected in green areas (e.g. parks, flowerbeds or tree lines) (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>), as confirmed also by similar reports for the cities of Rome
