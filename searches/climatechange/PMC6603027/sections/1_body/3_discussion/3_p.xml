<p id="Par26" class="p">When taking into consideration life form variations, the current increase in phanerophytes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) seems to be a common trait connected with the increase of naturalised species in urban floras

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, the growing amount of woody species (mainly ornamental plants) has been hypothesized to be in relation with the naturalisation of cultivated species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. Due to the strong increase of woody plants, the total percentage of therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Nonetheless, the current flora of Bologna is still dominated by therophytes and hemicryptophytes, while most of the newly introduced phanerophytes occur only temporarily, without forming persisting populations, as was also pointed out by Chocholousková 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> with regard to the flora of the city of Plzen. The therophytes/hemicryptophytes ratio also decreased in the period from 1894 (1.36) to 2018 (1.23) indirectly confirming climatic data that evidence an increase of summer drought over the years (

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) (from 4 to 12%) could be explained by the recent naturalisation of some ornamental species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Iris germanica</italic> L.), even if an underestimation of this type of plants in the past study could be hypothesized, as some common certainly present native species, like 
 <italic class="italic">Allium vineale</italic> L., were not recorded. Similar results were reported for several other European cities

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. However, the most glaring sign of the adaptation of the current flora to a warmer and drier climate is the increase in stenomediterranean species with respect to the past century. In fact, as pointed out by Hruška
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> and Interdonato 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, a high ratio of stenomediterranean/eurimediterranean species is typical of cities in southern Italy, which are usually on average much warmer than the city of Bologna located in northern Italy. Therefore, these cities may have started to host plants coming from warmer world regions
