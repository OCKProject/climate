<p id="Par4" class="p">Ecological studies in cities are not only aimed at investigating floristic diversity and connected ecosystem features; since cities represent microcosms of environmental changes happening globally, they can serve as informative test cases for understanding ecological system dynamics and responses to climate and land changes

 </sup>. Several previously published historical floristic/ecological studies considered comparisons over long periods of time (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). These studies are of great historical and botanical value as they reflect the situation preceding most anthropogenic interventions, such as industrialization and increasing household density. In fact, original site conditions in urban habitats have changed tremendously and present living conditions for plants are completely different from those occurring during the last century
