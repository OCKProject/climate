 </sup>. General data indicate that urbanization reduces native species diversity at a regional scale, while, on the contrary, total plant species richness often increases in the city centres in comparison to wildlands, due to the highly heterogeneous patchwork of urban habitats coupled with the human introduction of exotic species
