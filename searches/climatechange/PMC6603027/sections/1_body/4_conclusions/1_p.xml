<p id="Par30" class="p">The analysed data demonstrated that over 120 years the floristic diversity of Bologna’s historical city centre has deeply changed as a result of modifications in urban architecture, warmer climate conditions and the increasing anthropogenic pressure on the urban environment. In general, climate and urban changes did not lead to a loss of floristic diversity, but rather to a loss of “typicality”, with an almost tripled amount of alien species (mostly introduced ornamental plants

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the addition of tree lines along the main streets, the creation of small parks and the increase of irrigated areas around the historical city centre have made the urban landscape more heterogeneous than in the past, creating opportunities for the growth of a wider range of species. This factor coupled with the massive introduction of alien species are believed to be the cause of the general increase of biodiversity over the past 120 years.
