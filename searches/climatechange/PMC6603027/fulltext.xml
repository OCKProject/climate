The city of Bologna was selected as a case study since two specific and complete studies have been carried out in a 120-years timespan, one in 1894 and one in 2018. Since 1894, a large increase occurred in the number of taxa (families from 41 to 101, species from 176 to 477) and alien species (from 22 to 144), with a 65% total species turnover. The comparison of species life forms pointed out a noticeable recent expansion of phanerophytes and geophytes at the expense of therophytes and hemicryptophytes. The correlation between urbanistic features and plant richness indicated that the main factor affecting plant richness is the presence of green spaces (parks, tree lines, flowerbeds, etc.). Analysis of variation in Ellenberg&#x02019;s indicator values over the last 120 years evidenced a shift toward shade-tolerant species, mainly connected to the increased presence of parks and trees within the city. Climate change and the presence of artificially irrigated areas within the city has led to an increase in both hygrophilous and drought-resistant species. In particular, the temperature index showed a significantly higher amount of macrothermal species in accordance with a warmer climate and the urban heat island effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Plant ecology</kwd><kwd>Climate-change ecology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The world&#x02019;s population is experiencing a dramatic shift from rural to urban living. Whereas in 1900 only 10% of people were residing in cities, this number now exceeds 54% and is expected to increase to 66% by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The development of urban environments is one of the principal causes of land use change worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and believed to be the major cause of biodiversity alteration. Although floristic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> in urban areas is generally poorly documented, inside cities where comprehensive surveys have been undertaken plant species biodiversity is often remarkably high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. General data indicate that urbanization reduces native species diversity at a regional scale, while, on the contrary, total plant species richness often increases in the city centres in comparison to wildlands, due to the highly heterogeneous patchwork of urban habitats coupled with the human introduction of exotic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, in some semi-natural environments within cities, endangered native plant species show consistent populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> making urban habitats preferential sites for their conservation.</p><p id="Par3">It is argued that with the increase of global travel, which has led to a greater circulation of plant species and the spread from gardens of introduced alien plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, there has been an enhancement of species richness counterbalancing or even exceeding the potential local extinction of native species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Public urban parks were almost completely absent, while large agricultural areas (nowadays completely disappeared) were present within the historical city centre located inside the walls. Bare brick walls were common while roads were mainly unpaved or cobblestone-covered, offering the perfect conditions for plant settling. Natural local materials were used, like wood and gypsum in buildings and pebbles or trachyte slabs in main streets. In this urban context, the first complete study on the urban flora of Bologna was carried out by Lucio Gabelli in 1894<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, the city was completely renovated due to the large industrial expansion and the increase of the urban population. The ancient XIV century walls were almost completely demolished together with the moat and embankment surrounding them. All the main streets of the city were enlarged, rectified and paved, and the agricultural areas within the city centre were replaced by new buildings. Local materials were replaced and at present, streets are covered with asphalt, trachyte plates and porphyry cubes. Gypsum and wood lost importance as building materials, while brick walls were mostly plastered. Following the Second World War, the city experienced a great expansion outside its historical core, eliminating all the rural areas still present close to the city. To counterbalance the lack of green areas, tree lines were planted and small parks were created within the city centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dru.iperbole.bologna.it/normativa/prg-1985">http://dru.iperbole.bologna.it/normativa/prg-1985</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rapu.it/ricerca/scheda_piano.php?id_piano=138">http://www.rapu.it/ricerca/scheda_piano.php?id_piano=138</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ambiente.regione.emilia-romagna.it">http://ambiente.regione.emilia-romagna.it</ext-link>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study area corresponding to the historical centre of the city of Bologna.

Making a comparison between Bologna&#x02019;s current flora and the one present over 120 years ago is certainly not an easy task, in particular due to the different methodologies followed for data collection and the changes of plant scientific names that occurred over the years. In fact, in &#x0201c;Salinitro <italic>et al</italic>.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, data were generated from direct observations based on a network of transects that uniformly covered the study area.

The data described in &#x0201c;Gabelli&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> were instead a mix of direct observations, done by the author himself, and reports by two other previous authors, without following a scientific sampling methodology. Species localities in the ancient study were rarely recorded (i.e. with the name of a street or an ancient city door), instead most species were described as common in certain habitats (i.e. along the roads, in paved areas, in gardens, etc.) or defined as widespread in the whole city. Plant names cited in the ancient study were often outdated (not used anymore in modern plant systematics) and, even though common names were not reported in &#x0201c;Gabelli&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, the linkage between ancient synonym and modern name was always possible.</p><p id="Par13">Finally, data collection based on reports in &#x0201c;Gabelli&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> has caused an inevitable bias in the estimation of species abundance.

Plants defined as common or widespread in the 1894 city were also taken into consideration for the whole modern city area.

A large turnover in species was detected, with only 113 species still in common between the two floras; the S&#x000f8;rensen similarity index value was 0.35, indicating a mean 65% of species turnover in 120 years. Over this time period some of the most represented botanical families (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) have changed.

In contrast, the <italic>Asparagaceae</italic> family, not recorded in the old study, entered in the top ten, while the <italic>Rosaceae</italic> family underwent a significant increase of 68%. The species newly introduced in Bologna&#x02019;s contemporary flora<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (mostly alien ornamental) belong to different botanical families, with the result that 30% of the current botanical families are represented by only one species (data not shown).

Therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased (from 49 to 32% and from 36 to 26%, respectively) while no change was found for chamaephytes (around 5%). In addition, the chorological spectra deeply changed between the ancient and the modern floras (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), evidencing a doubling of naturalised (from 13.6 to 28.9%) and stenomediterranean species (from the 3.4 to the 6.5%).

Among the three different building areas identified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), new building area (NBA), old city centre (OCC), and historical building area (HBA), several differences were observed regarding the presence of green spaces and the type of flooring used that affect floristic richness and composition. The presence of green spaces adjacent to streets, such as gardens, flowerbeds or tree-lines, was quite different: 40.6% in NBA, 36.2% in HBA and only 12.7% in OCC. The most widespread paving for HBA and NBA was asphalt, while trachyte plates were more abundant in OCC. The presence of porphyry cubes was almost constant among the three building areas, while cobblestone paving was scarcely represented (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The influence of paving materials on total species richness was shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>. Transects richest in species were primarily characterized by the presence of green spaces and asphalt, while, on the contrary, those showing porphyry cubes and trachyte slabs were the poorest.

Differences in structure and materials present in each type of building area not only affected species richness but also led to the differentiation into three different sub-floras (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

The species number increase seems to be a common trend in many urban areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, nonetheless the large number of species detected in &#x0201c;Salinitro <italic>et al</italic>. 2018&#x0201d; could also be partly due to an underestimation of total species richness in &#x0201c;Gabelli. 1894&#x0201d;. However, the recorded amount of alien species was in line with European and world averages, e.g. 25.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and 28%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A similar increase was also found when higher taxa levels (genera and families) were analysed and, in general, the high diversity in cities could be ascribed to the large variety of urban microhabitats and, above all, to the human voluntary and non-voluntary introduction of species for ornamental purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In fact, the cultivation of ornamental plants for leisure and decoration represents the primary factor contributing to the increase of neophytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Asteraceae and Poaceae were found to be the most widespread botanical families in Bologna&#x02019;s current flora, similarly to many other urban areas in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The increase of <italic>Asparagaceae</italic>, <italic>Rosaceae</italic> and <italic>Oleaceae</italic> could be mainly ascribed to the naturalisation of cultivated species. Interestingly, 65% of recently lost species are represented by indigenous ones, as previously detected also in other cities such as Z&#x000fc;rich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (about 60%). As a confirmation of previous considerations, the S&#x000f8;rensen similarity index, indicating the species turnover and calculated between Bologna&#x02019;s ancient and modern flora, is significantly lower (0.35) compared to other cities like Z&#x000fc;rich, Brussels and Plzen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (on average 0.80). This large species turnover detected in Bologna over 120 years may reflect the urbanistic changes the city centre underwent from the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, like the disappearance of cultivated fields and medieval walls, which dramatically reduced the presence of green areas in the city<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, the huge floristic turnover connected to urban modification regarded in particular the disappearance of crop species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. &#x0201c;Gabelli, 1894&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> reported fruit-bearing trees, cereals and common weeds as widely naturalised inside the city centre. In Bologna&#x02019;s current flora, field species, like <italic>Legousia speculum-veneris</italic> (L.) Chaix, <italic>Echium vulgare</italic> L. and <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L., and cultivated crops like <italic>Zea mays</italic> L., are no longer present in the urban area due to the intense urbanization process that occurred over the last century and changed the shape of the city (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A similar reduction in field species has previously been observed in other cities like, e.g., Brussels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, because of the choice of a restricted and highly urbanized study area for both reference studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> stochastic processes connected to extreme anthropogenic influences are predominant in urban environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">When taking into consideration life form variations, the current increase in phanerophytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) seems to be a common trait connected with the increase of naturalised species in urban floras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Similarly, the growing amount of woody species (mainly ornamental plants) has been hypothesized to be in relation with the naturalisation of cultivated species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Due to the strong increase of woody plants, the total percentage of therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Nonetheless, the current flora of Bologna is still dominated by therophytes and hemicryptophytes, while most of the newly introduced phanerophytes occur only temporarily, without forming persisting populations, as was also pointed out by Chocholouskov&#x000e1; <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> with regard to the flora of the city of Plzen. The therophytes/hemicryptophytes ratio also decreased in the period from 1894 (1.36) to 2018 (1.23) indirectly confirming climatic data that evidence an increase of summer drought over the years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://storage.provincia.re.it">http://storage.provincia.re.it</ext-link>) which generally favoured the growth of annual plants. Moreover, the increase of geophytes species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) (from 4 to 12%) could be explained by the recent naturalisation of some ornamental species (e.g. <italic>Iris germanica</italic> L.), even if an underestimation of this type of plants in the past study could be hypothesized, as some common certainly present native species, like <italic>Allium vineale</italic> L., were not recorded. Similar results were reported for several other European cities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, the most glaring sign of the adaptation of the current flora to a warmer and drier climate is the increase in stenomediterranean species with respect to the past century. In fact, as pointed out by Hru&#x00161;ka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and Interdonato <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, a high ratio of stenomediterranean/eurimediterranean species is typical of cities in southern Italy, which are usually on average much warmer than the city of Bologna located in northern Italy. Therefore, these cities may have started to host plants coming from warmer world regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">The comparison of EIVs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) pointed out the ongoing adaptation of the flora to the changes that occurred in the city over the last century. In particular, an expansion of all shade-tolerant categories at the expense of heliophilous ones was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,D</xref>). Analogous findings were reported for the cities of Plzen, Brussels, Zurich and Halle using data collected over a similar timespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The observed changes could be correlated to urbanistic and structural modifications of the city, which include a general enlargement of the main avenues and planting of trees in parks and streets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The currently present tree lines can, therefore, be considered responsible for the settling of many understory and sciophilous species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, like <italic>Hedera helix</italic> L. and <italic>Trachycarpus fortunei</italic> (Hook.) H. Wendl. Pteridophytes also largely contributed to the shade-tolerant plant category (light index categories 1 to 5) while they were poorly represented in the historical flora list, being probably underestimated. Moisture index changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B,E</xref>) mainly reflected the anthropic changes of the city, like the widespread use of irrigation systems inside Bologna&#x02019;s historical centre. This practice inevitably overshadows the effects of climate changes on floral biodiversity, as long as the soil moisture content is artificially modified. F index data collected for Bologna&#x02019;s city centre showed an increased presence of hygrophilous plants (categories 6 to 8, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) analogously to what reported for several other European cities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> like Plzen, Halle and Brussels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This trend was confirmed by EIVs analysed for lost and acquired species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>) with a net gain of hygrophilous species in the 2018 flora. As previously demonstrated for other cities, for example Boston<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, irrigated areas turn out to be a shelter for species that otherwise would be no longer present in the area, such as hygrophilous species like <italic>Epilobium montanum</italic> L., <italic>Equisetum arvense</italic> L. and <italic>Eclipta prostrata</italic> (L.) L., which were recently found in Bologna. However, it is not possible to exclude the presence of such species from the 1894 flora. In fact, at that time the city centre was characterized by a wide extension of channels that probably hosted a large number of plants, including many hygrophilous species, which were not recorded by Gabelli as these channels were not investigated.</p><p id="Par28">Analysing the temperature EIV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C,F</xref>), an increase in mesothermal and macrothermal (categories 7 to 10) species and a concomitant decrease of tolerant species (category X), was evidenced. A similar trend has been found in most of the cities previously investigated, in agreement with a global temperature increase (more evident in urban environments) in the last decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Key players of these biodiversity changes are many Mediterranean (e.g. <italic>Pistacia therebinthus</italic> L. and <italic>Cupressus sempervirens</italic> L.) and alien thermophilic species (e.g. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>cooperi</italic> (Hook.f.) L.Bolus and <italic>Chlorophytum comosum</italic> (Thunb.) Jacques), which in recent years have started to survive the winter given the milder temperatures. The tropicalization of the flora is, in fact, supported by the U.H.I.&#x02019;s in many European cities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> which, in particular in the Bologna city area, resulted in an increase of winter low temperatures of 2.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C compared to the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, the strong decrease of species with a wider tolerance (category X) was confirmed by a shift toward extreme temperatures, especially in summer. In the present data, the maximum plant species richness was detected in green areas (e.g. parks, flowerbeds or tree lines) (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>), as confirmed also by similar reports for the cities of Rome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and Z&#x000fc;rich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> with in the latter case the richest area sampled being the one containing the botanical garden.</p><p id="Par29">The positive correlation between species richness and green areas was further confirmed by the progressive impoverishment of urban biodiversity going from HBA to NBA to OCC, in accordance with the decreasing presence of green areas. Similar patterns were reported for the city of Rome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, where the historical centre (approximately corresponding to Bologna&#x02019;s OCC) and new 1950&#x02013;1980 building developments (similar to NBA) showed the poorest levels of plant diversity. Our findings also support the thesis that paving materials differently contributed to enhance or decrease street floristic richness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>), suggesting that building materials could have played an important role in characterizing current urban flora. Furthermore, previous results on Bologna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> showed a negative correlation between floristic diversity and street width (generally higher in NBA and HBA with respect to OCC) suggesting that the larger modern streets have played an important role in increasing plant richness coupled with the creation of new green spaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">The analysed data demonstrated that over 120 years the floristic diversity of Bologna&#x02019;s historical city centre has deeply changed as a result of modifications in urban architecture, warmer climate conditions and the increasing anthropogenic pressure on the urban environment. In general, climate and urban changes did not lead to a loss of floristic diversity, but rather to a loss of &#x0201c;typicality&#x0201d;, with an almost tripled amount of alien species (mostly introduced ornamental plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) and the disappearance of native and crop species, resulting in a homogenisation of the flora<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the addition of tree lines along the main streets, the creation of small parks and the increase of irrigated areas around the historical city centre have made the urban landscape more heterogeneous than in the past, creating opportunities for the growth of a wider range of species. This factor coupled with the massive introduction of alien species are believed to be the cause of the general increase of biodiversity over the past 120 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
