<p class="p">Here, we use conceptual models to illustrate the potential for the locally‐adaptive traits contained in range‐edge populations to confer relative fitness advantages and dictate the short‐term responses of species to novel climates. In developing our conceptual models, we focus on tree species as an exemplar group because of the foundational roles that these long‐lived species play in many ecosystems. The theoretical background and empirical evidence of local adaptations in range‐edge populations has been summarized elsewhere (Bridle and Vines
