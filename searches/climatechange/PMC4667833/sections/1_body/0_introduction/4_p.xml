<p class="p">The conservation value of range‐edge populations over evolutionary time scales has been well documented (Lesica and Allendorf

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Over shorter time scales, the role of range‐edge populations for determining species' responses to rapid anthropogenic climate change remains largely underappreciated (but see Gibson et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Range‐edge populations may become even more valuable under future climates as growing human populations will almost certainly increase the rate of large‐scale land‐use changes (Soares‐Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) and accelerate climate change velocity (IPCC 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Despite their potential importance, recent efforts highlight that conservation networks often fail to adequately protect genetically unique range‐edge populations (Lefévre et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Schueler et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). It is clearly critical that we develop a more comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the synergies between disturbance at species' range edges and the ability of species to respond to climate change.
