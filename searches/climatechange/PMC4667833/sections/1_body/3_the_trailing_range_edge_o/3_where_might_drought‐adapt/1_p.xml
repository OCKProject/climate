<p class="p">Our understanding of intraspecific variation in drought tolerances in tropical trees is limited (McDowell et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Craven et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). That said, it is reasonable to assume that many or most widespread Amazonian species exhibit some degree of local adaptation to moisture conditions given the ubiquity of genetic clines across temperature and moisture gradients in temperate species (Savolainen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; McDowell et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). To highlight the potential for Amazonian plant species to exhibit local adaptations to moisture stress, we mapped the total annual precipitation (TAP; mm yr‐1) TAP (mm) and maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD; mm) across the distributions of 2157 widespread and large‐ranged tree species (estimated range size ≥300,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) within the Amazon. MCWD is an integrative measure of the accumulative water stress experienced by plants in an area over the course of a year and has previously been found to be a strong predictor of species distributions as well as the location of humid tropical forests and other tropical biomes (Malhi et al.
