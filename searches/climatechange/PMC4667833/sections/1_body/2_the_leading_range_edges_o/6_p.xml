<p class="p">Large‐scale anthropogenic habitat disturbances near species' cold range edges could fragment and eliminate important leading range‐edge populations. For example, expansive forest clearing to make way for pastoral or agricultural lands has already occurred at many alpine treelines that are the cold range edges of numerous montane tree species (Körner 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Similarly, a combination of fires and deforestation of temperate forests at and around latitudinal treelines continues at a high rate (Payette et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Even once anthropogenic disturbances have ceased at these cold or leading species range edges, repopulation of the former range limit occurs slowly, if at all (Holtmeier and Broll 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the loss and fragmentation of high‐latitude and high‐elevation forests is removing well‐adapted local populations that will be pivotal in allowing species to persist in their former and current ranges and expand their ranges under future climates, even in the absence of continuing human disturbance.
