<p class="p">Local adaptations, such as the timing of tissue growth to minimize freezing damage while maximizing growing season length (Kollas et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), may be necessary for individuals to persist in species' current cold range edges. Indeed, latitudinal and altitudinal treelines are thought to occur at the point where cold temperatures directly limit tree growth, and therefore, optimizing growth during the short growing season while avoiding potentially lethal freezing events is a necessary prerequisite for populations inhabiting the treeline ecotone. Under future climate scenarios, local adaptations such as those found in treeline populations will also be necessary for populations to experience range expansion via colonization of areas becoming newly suitable under warmer temperatures. The lack of cold‐adapted individuals will effectively reduce the species' fundamental niche breadth and hence reduce the geographic extent of suitable areas.
