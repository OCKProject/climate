<p class="p">We give special attention to the responses of locally‐adapted range‐edge populations to only temperature and precipitation as these two variables are often found to be the most important abiotic determinants of range limits in trees (Cahill et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Under future climate scenarios, it is likely that the relative importance of range‐edge populations to total species' persistence will increase dramatically. However, other abiotic factors (e.g., additional climatic factors, soil conditions) and biotic factors (e.g., herbivory rates, competition) will also likely influence species' responses to climate change. With rapid advancements in the breadth and complexity of predictive tools, we should begin to incorporate both climatic and nonclimatic factors into our conceptual models to create more realistic and accurate predictions of species shifts under future climates (Svenning et al.
