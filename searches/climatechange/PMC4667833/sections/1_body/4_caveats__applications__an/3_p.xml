<p class="p">We also did not explicitly incorporate the phenotypic responses of local genotypes. We believe that this is justified due to the unprecedented magnitude and pace of current climate change which will quickly introduce novel environmental conditions that are likely to be beyond what species can tolerate through plastic responses and acclimation (Jump and Peñuelas

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Plasticity itself is an evolvable trait, but adaptive plasticity is most likely to evolve when cues reliably predict environmental conditions (van Kleunen and Fischer

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Given the current pace of climate change and that environmental cues may become progressively unreliable and environmental conditions unpredictable, rapid evolutionary responses of plasticity and other traits are unlikely in organisms such as trees that are long‐lived and have long generation times (van Kleunen and Fischer

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although rapid adaptation can occur over a surprisingly small number of generations, the long generation times in trees means that any adaptive responses to climate change will likely lag behind changes in climate (Jump and Peñuelas 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Quintero and Wiens 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). As such, we limit our discussion to the beneficial traits currently expressed by locally‐adapted genotypes and we do not specifically address adaptive phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary processes.
