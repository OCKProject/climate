<p class="p">Specific focus should be given to identifying the traits within locally‐adapted populations that are predicted to become more important under future climate conditions (e.g., heat and drought tolerance). Identifying the responsible genetic controls of these traits will aid in conservation efforts and advance our ability to accurately forecast where and when locally‐adapted range‐edge populations will be important determinants of species persistence. Even in well‐studied traits, such as cold temperature adaptation in northern hemisphere trees, we still have a relatively basic understanding of how specific genes control phenotypic expression and how genes are linked or interact (Howe et al.

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Without knowing the constraints to heritable variation in traits under selection, we are unable to make accurate predictions about rapid evolutionary adaptation in populations.
