<p class="p">The six vegetation types display mean temperature indicator values (Landolt et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) that reflect their distribution in elevation, with highest values for the calcareous grasslands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>A). The calcareous grasslands and the typical snowbeds are the only plant communities showing a significant increase in their mean temperature values between inventories (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.010 and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.004, respectively). Similarly, the value for soil humidity (F) reflects the moisture conditions of the plant communities, with the four types of grasslands having lower values than the two snowbed communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>B). Species present in the recent records of the typical and wet snowbeds have, on average, lower values than the composition of historical surveys, indicating their preference for drier conditions. However, only the decrease in the latter one is significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.004). None of the studied plant communities show significant variations between historical and recent surveys in terms of soil nutrient requirements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>C), light, and soil pH (Appendices S4 and S5), according to the corresponding mean ecological indicator values.
