<p class="p">In all the vegetation types but the calcareous grasslands, the number of species, whose frequency increased since the historical survey, exceeds species whose frequency decreased (data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q82j0" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q82j0</ext-link>), and only increasing frequencies are significant. Regarding changes in species cover, most of the species in the calcareous grasslands, the siliceous subalpine, and alpine grasslands show a decrease in the mean cover, whereas most of the species in the windy ridges, the typical, and wet snowbeds increase in cover. But very few cover changes are significant.
