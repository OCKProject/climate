<p class="p">The species, whose frequency and cover greatly increased in typical snowbeds, are mostly from siliceous alpine grasslands as well: 
 <italic class="italic">Leontodon helveticus</italic> increases by 62.5% in frequency (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.019) and 3.3% in cover (not significant), while 
 <italic class="italic">Helictotrichon versicolor</italic> was absent in the historical survey, but is present in half of the recent plots (marginally significant, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.057). Between the other species increasing both in frequency and cover (defined as “winners”, Appendix S3c), most of them are typical of grasslands and are generalists (
 <italic class="italic">Ligusticum mutellina, Nardus stricta)</italic>. In contrast, the species with the most important, but not significant, cover decrease (
 <italic class="italic">Carex foetida</italic>) is typical of snowbeds.
