<p class="p">Beta‐diversity shows an opposite trend with a slight decrease in the mean Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index between historical and recent records in each plant community, except for the calcareous grasslands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), whose inventories always show the same low dissimilarity level. The highest homogenization is observed in the siliceous alpine grasslands, where the mean dissimilarity index decreased by 0.05 ± 0.03 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.002), followed by the windy ridges (−0.04 ± 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.002) and the siliceous subalpine grasslands (−0.04 ± 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.010). The two snowbeds also show a dissimilarity decrease, but not significantly.
