<p class="p">Between the historical and the recent surveys, 47 of 63 plots show an increase in alpha‐diversity and 16 show a decrease. The magnitude of the increase varies between vegetation types (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The windy ridges show the highest increase in the mean Simpson diversity index (+6.3 ± 6.0, difference between medians being significant with a 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.004), followed by the siliceous subalpine grasslands (+4.8 ± 6.7, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.017) and the wet snowbeds (+4.1 ± 3.5, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.004). The increase in alpha‐diversity in the other plant communities is not significant.
