<p class="p">The six plant communities display different directions and amplitudes in their temporal shifts in the cover‐weighted PCA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The first two axes of PCA explain 23.3% of the total variance (PC1: 13.0%; PC2: 10.3%). The most evident shifts are those of snowbeds: the typical ones show a significant (

 <italic class="italic">,</italic> while the recent species composition of the wet snowbeds is significantly closer (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.006) to the typical snowbeds than the historical composition. The windy ridges plots shift in two main directions (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐value = 0.047), either toward calcareous grasslands or the siliceous ones. The three grassland communities have no significant shift in species composition. In particular, the calcareous grasslands display a high stability in terms of species composition. Similar trends, in direction and magnitude, are displayed when presence–absence data are considered (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, four couples of records originally attributed to the siliceous alpine grasslands are here assimilated to the typical snowbed group, sharing with it the same unidirectional trend toward siliceous grasslands. These records have a species composition similar to those of typical snowbeds, but, because of the dominance of some grassland species, they are assimilated to the alpine grassland group when cover is taken into account. Hence, they can be considered as transition between snowbeds and siliceous alpine grasslands.
