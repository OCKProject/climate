<p class="p">Sixty‐three pairs of reliable records have been retained (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32354-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>): 10 in the calcareous grasslands, 13 in the windy ridges, 12 in the siliceous subalpine grasslands, 11 in the siliceous alpine grasslands, 8 in the typical snowbeds, and 9 in the wet snowbeds. A clustering analysis (using the Hellinger distance and the Ward aggregation algorithm) of cover‐weighted historical and recent inventories together showed that all old and recent records were placed by pairs in the same group corresponding to their respective plant community, except for one snowbed plot (R3935), which shifted from the wet to the typical snowbeds. For subsequent analyses, this record was retained at its original group.
