<p class="p">The increase in species richness is related to an increase in the floristic similarity inside the plant community, except in the calcareous grasslands. Similar homogenization was first highlighted on seven European Alpine summits by Jurasinski and Kreyling (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), and on a variety of alpine plant communities since then (Britton et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Ross et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Carbognani et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). According to their observations, the biotic homogenization results from two processes: the invasion of widespread and generalist species, and a decline of rare and specialized species. Generalist species may be able to spread in new areas previously unsuitable, thanks to less constraining conditions for their establishment and survival, such as longer growing seasons through climate warming, or increased nutrient availability (Britton et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Indeed, such a pattern is apparent in this study, where snowbed specialists decrease in cover, while grassland generalist species increase in frequency and cover (see Appendix S3). An increasing alpha‐diversity coupled with a homogenization can be explained by the arrival of previously missing species in the community, completing the typical species ensemble for a given vegetation type (e.g.,
