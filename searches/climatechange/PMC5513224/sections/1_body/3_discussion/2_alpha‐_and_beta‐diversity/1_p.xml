<p class="p">The increase in species richness, expressed as Simpson diversity index at the plot scale, is observed in each plant community. There are three possible explanations: (1) new species arrived since the historical time; (2) the recent inventories were more exhaustive than the historical ones, or (3) the new species are the result of inaccurate location of the plots. The last option can be excluded because it cannot result in a systematic increase for all the vegetation types. The second option could be meaningful only for the least frequent species (i.e., occurring in one or two new plots), but not for those with a considerable increase (for example, 
 <italic class="italic">Globularia cordifolia</italic> in the calcareous grasslands). Moreover, many of these species are easily visible in terms of size and/or difficult to confuse with other species. Therefore, the colonization of plots by new species is at least partly responsible for the observed increase in alpha‐diversity. Many previous studies observed the same trend over the last three decades on alpine plant communities (Kudernatsch et al.

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) observed that species‐poor communities were more susceptible to species invasion than highly diverse species communities. Our results do not confirm such a trend, as the highest species increase was observed on the windy ridges community, which are more diverse than typical snowbeds.
