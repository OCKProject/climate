 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) predicted that, with a temperature rise of 4°C in 2071–2100 (Christensen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), the snow volume in the Alps at 2000 m may reduce by 50% and the melting season advanced by 50–60 days. As this study clearly demonstrates, changes in snow precipitations may have a stronger impact on the subalpine–alpine plant communities than warmer temperatures, at least for communities directly dependent on snow cover as a limit to the growing season. However, very probably, the grasslands will not be able to stand such a temperature increase without important changes as well. But, with the available data, it is not possible to conclude whether changes will still be very slow, like those observed until now, which will induce a large local extinction debt (Dullinger et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), or whether strong and sudden changes are expected after forest colonization, successive years of drought, development of diseases (Ayres and Lombardero 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), or the arrival of new herbivores (Pellissier et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Future monitoring of alpine grasslands will be particularly important to address these questions.
