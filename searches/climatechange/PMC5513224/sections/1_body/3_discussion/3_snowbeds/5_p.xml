<p class="p">Similar to the typical snowbeds, but over a shorter time period (median of historical records years = 1988, Table 
 <xref rid="ece32354-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), the wet snowbeds show increasingly dry conditions. Reductions in snow precipitation, combined with higher temperatures, likely shorten the amount and duration of water supply (Beniston et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) to these communities, mostly located under melting firn. The cover decrease in typical alliance species and the diffusion of snowbed species, in parallel with the reduction in the mean humidity indicator value (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>B), indicate that these sites are rapidly shifting toward typical snowbed communities. The same drying trend was observed with the expansion of some graminoids and shrub species in Norwegian wet snowbeds (Sandvik and Odland 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), on soligenous and ombrogenous mires (Virtanen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Ross et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and springs (Britton et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). These last vegetation types do not belong to snowbeds, but they are subject to the same water‐logged conditions, which limit the growth of taller plants. Diverse alpine plant communities, directly related to high water supply, seem to respond similarly to climate changes.
