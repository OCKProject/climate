<p class="p">Moreover, snow is an efficient scavenger of atmospheric pollutants, which are leached through the snowpack, mainly at the beginning of the melt period (Johannessen and Henriksen

 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>C). But, we cannot exclude that higher temperatures, combined with relatively high nutrient level in the soil, allow more thermophilous species (grassland species) to establish in the snowbeds, independently from the length of the growing season.
