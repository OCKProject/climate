<p class="p">The snowbed species are able to respond positively to experimental warming (Arft et al.

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) and can theoretically profit for earlier snow‐free habitats. But they are restricted to snowbed habitats because of lower competition from co‐occurring plants (Heegaard and Vandvik 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). The arrival of taller species from the surrounding grasslands might increase the competition and induce a decrease in typical snowbed species. Hulber et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) suggested that the presence of neighbors in snowbed systems leads to competitive effects rather than facilitative ones, which can be expected in such harsh environmental conditions (Choler et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Moreover, the role of competition might increase with warming, as experimentally observed by Olsen and Klanderud (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the study sites, no significant decrease is observed, but the strong decrease in cover of
