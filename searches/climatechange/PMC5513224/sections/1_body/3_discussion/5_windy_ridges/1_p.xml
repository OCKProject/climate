<p class="p">The community on windy ridges shows a significant change in species composition according to the PCA (Figs 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Indeed, the centroid shifts toward the calcareous grasslands, although some of the recent inventories are closer to the siliceous grasslands instead. The species increasing in frequency confirm this pattern, with some related to the calcareous grasslands and others to the siliceous ones. The different shifts seem to be related to soil pH, as shown by soil analyses, but a higher number of plots would be necessary for a better understanding of these divergences. Research on comparable habitats (such as alpine heaths on windy ridges) shows diversified reactions to past climatic changes, from very limited changes (Elumeeva et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), to an increase in dwarf shrubs (Virtanen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) or graminoid increase related to a dwarf shrub and forb decrease (Ross et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The only common feature is the lichen decrease, attributed either to summer reindeer grazing (Virtanen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), or to nitrogen deposition (Armitage et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), trampling, and climate warming (see Ross et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref> and references therein). Unfortunately, the majority of our historical inventories do not give any indication of lichen covers (Appendix S2). Consequently, this study cannot confirm such a trend.
