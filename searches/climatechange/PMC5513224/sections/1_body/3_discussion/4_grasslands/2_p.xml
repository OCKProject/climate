<p class="p">Nevertheless, this general stability is also accompanied by new species or increase in frequency. Some of these species (
 <italic class="italic">Globularia cordifolia</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Cirsium acaule</italic>), although frequently associated to calcareous grasslands, have their optimum at lower elevations. Conversely, the only significantly declining species, 
 <italic class="italic">Carex sempervirens,</italic> has its optimum at the lower alpine rather than the subalpine belt. These changes in composition are reflected by a significant increase in the mean indicator value for temperature observed across the calcareous grasslands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>A). In conclusion, although displaying a high stability, these grasslands seem to experience the arrival of species from lower elevations, as repeatedly observed on alpine and nival summits (see Stöckli et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref> for a review). Interestingly, in long‐term studies focused on lower elevation grasslands (Britton et al.

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), most of the species decreasing in frequency and/or cover have an alpine‐to‐arctic distribution, while those increasing have broader or lower elevation ranges.
