<p class="p">According to Dullinger etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), the elevational shift of plant species observed on alpine summits may display faster cool edge expansion than warm edge retreat because of the potentially long persistence of declining populations under unsuitable conditions. The stability of the subalpine and alpine grasslands, while snowbeds are changing, seems to confirm this prediction and indicates that, during the last few decades, subalpine and lower alpine species expanded upwards from their elevational range rather than shifting it.
