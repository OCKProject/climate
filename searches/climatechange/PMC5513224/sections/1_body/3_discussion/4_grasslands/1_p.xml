<p class="p">In contrast to plant communities related to long snow cover, calcareous and siliceous grasslands demonstrate a high stability of species composition and cover, whatever the bedrock type (Figs

 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Similar results were obtained by warming experiments on subalpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains (Price and Waser 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), on calcareous grasslands in northern England after a 13‐years exposure to climate changes (Grime et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), and observed too by long‐term surveys in the Alps (Vittoz et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), Windmaißer and Reisch (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). These authors identified many possible explanatory factors. Firstly, the high plant density and belowground phytomass of subalpine grasslands, compared to the sparse vegetation of alpine and nival summits or to the low species abundance in snowbeds, lead to high competition levels for light and soil resources, which restricts the establishment of new species (Choler et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Secondly, the extreme longevity of some grass species (
 <italic class="italic">C. curvula</italic> can reach a maximum of 5000 years; de Witte et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), the persistence of their shoot and root systems, and their clonal growth, that allows the continuous recolonization of vegetation gaps, result in a high resilience to interannual variations (Hillier et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) with a consequent long‐term persistence. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Laserpitium siler</italic>, which was a dominant species in half of the plots in calcareous grasslands, is highly competitive in terms of light and water resources and occupies a wide elevation range, thus likely preventing colonization by new species. Thirdly, the steep slopes where the calcareous grasslands are established could also explain their stability. According to Theurillat and Guisan (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), slopes steeper than 40° (which is often the case in this study) may act as barriers to upward dispersal of species.
