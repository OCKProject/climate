<p class="p">Siliceous subalpine and alpine grasslands show a different trend with supplementary species either having very widespread distribution (
 <italic class="italic">Euphrasia minima</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Homogyne alpina</italic>) or arriving from the same species pool (
 <italic class="italic">Arnica montana, Hieracium alpinum</italic>). This process, known as range filling, was already observed in the Italian Alps by Cannone and Pignatti (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and seems to be predominant compared to the upward shift. Indeed, neither did montane species colonize the siliceous subalpine grasslands, nor did subalpine species move upward and colonize the siliceous alpine grasslands. The abovementioned stabilizing factors appear to be important in these siliceous grasslands.
