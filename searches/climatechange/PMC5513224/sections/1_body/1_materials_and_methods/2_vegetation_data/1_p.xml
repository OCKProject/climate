<p class="p">In order to have a complete overview of reactions of subalpine–lower alpine vegetation to climate change, six common vegetation types, for which more historical data are available, were selected (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32354-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> and Appendix S2). Each vegetation type corresponds to a phytosociological alliance given between brackets: calcareous grasslands (
 <italic class="italic">Seslerion</italic>) located in the subalpine–alpine belt, generally on very steep, south‐exposed slopes; windy ridges (
 <italic class="italic">Elynion</italic>) in alpine belt, situated mostly on calcareous substrates; siliceous subalpine grasslands (
 <italic class="italic">Nardion</italic>); siliceous alpine grasslands (
 <italic class="italic">Caricion curvulae</italic>); typical snowbeds (
 <italic class="italic">Salicion herbaceae</italic>) associated with very long snow cover and acidic soil conditions; wet snowbeds (
 <italic class="italic">Caricion bicolori‐atrofuscae</italic>) also associated with very long snow cover, but close to running water, brought by rivers or firn melting, or close to lakes.
