<p class="p">Among the available data, a selection of the most promising historical records was performed according to criteria of reliability and possibility to relocate them. The historical records were achieved by several botanists from 1965 to 1990 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32354-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) with most data being collected during the 1970s (1980s in the case of wet snowbeds). The inventories were only partly published (Ammann

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), but field books were available for most of them and they represented the main information source. Because of their localization on topographic or vegetation maps (1:25,000 or more precise), the plot areas were approximately localized in the field, with a precision of ± 10–50 m. Each area was extensively visited, and, on the basis of information contained in the historical field books (site description, elevation, surface, slope, and exposition), the possible plot sites were defined. The exact plot location was selected in order to have a species composition as close as possible to the historical one. This permits a conservative approach of potential changes. When no area corresponded to the historical description, or when vegetation was markedly different, the site was discarded. Only historical records separated by a distance &gt;10 m were retained in order to avoid spatial autocorrelation. Finally, 63 plots have been localized with a high confidence level. A new exhaustive record of all vascular plants was performed during summers 2013 or 2014 at the phenological optimum, within the same area as the historical one. Species cover was visually estimated, as in historical inventories, according to cover classes of Braun‐Blanquet (

The plots were marked with metal plates in soil and the four corners measured with a high precision GPS (GeoXT, Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA) in order to enable their future use as permanent plots. Finally, the nomenclature of species is according to Aeschimann et al. (
