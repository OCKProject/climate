<p class="p">The three study sites have been partially included in natural reserves for several decades. Except for Grimsel, where there has been no cattle grazing since 1953, the two other sites are currently pastured in some parts. Thanks to the natural reserve management in Morteys, the land use (cow and goat grazing) has barely changed during the last 40 years. In Réchy, the type and amount of cattle have fluctuated since the 1970s with alternating cow and sheep grazing, proportions depending on both elevation and location.</p>
