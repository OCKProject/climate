 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). The slopes in the Grimsel Valley are covered by various moraine deposits from the last maximum glacier advances that occurred between 1860 and 1920 (Ammann

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The annual sum of fresh snow thickness decreased in average by 71.2 cm per decade, and the mean summer temperature rose by 0.41°C per decade between 1964 and 2011 (Grimsel Hospiz, 1980 m; Fig.
