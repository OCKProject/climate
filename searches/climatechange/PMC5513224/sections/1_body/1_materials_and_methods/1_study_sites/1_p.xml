<p class="p">Three study sites are located in the Northern Alps and western central Alps of Switzerland (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The Northern Alps are characterized by higher precipitations than the Central Alps. The Morteys area (46°32′N, 7°09′E) is situated on a calcareous bedrock with karstic geomorphology. The plots are located between 1698 and 2232 m a.s.l., in the transition from the subalpine to the lower alpine belt. The mean annual temperature is about 2.1°C, and the annual precipitations are 1650 mm (Zimmermann and Kienast

The annual sum of fresh snow thickness decreased by 34.1 cm per decade between 1964 and 2011, while the mean summer temperature (from June to September) increased by 0.47°C per decade during the same period at the closest meteorological station (Château‐d'Oex, 1029 m; Fig.
