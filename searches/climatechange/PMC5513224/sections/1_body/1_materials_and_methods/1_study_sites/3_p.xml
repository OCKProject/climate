<p class="p">The Réchy area (46°10′N, 7°30′E) is located on a mixed bedrock composed by gneiss, mica schists, quartzite, calcshists, marble, and cornieule and is shaped by geomorphological processes related to glaciers, gravity movements, and cryoturbation. A mosaic of acid and alkaline soils characterizes the area. Elevation of the vegetation plots ranges from 2328 to 2697 m a.s.l., namely the tree line ecotone and the lower alpine belt of the region. The area is the coldest and the driest among the three study sites, with a mean annual temperature of −0.53°C and 1480 mm of annual precipitations (Zimmermann and Kienast
