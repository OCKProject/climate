<p class="p">The floristic shifts between historical and recent records were visualized using two principal component analyses (PCA, R 
 <italic class="italic">vegan</italic> library): one based on species composition and cover, and the other based on presence–absence data. The cover values were previously submitted to Hellinger transformation, which is recommended when performing PCA with species cover data (Borcard et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In order to test the significance of the temporal shifts in species composition and cover along the first three axes of PCA, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied on the differences of axis scores against the intercept for each vegetation type individually (Vittoz et al.
