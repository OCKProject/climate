<p class="p">A possible homogenization in plant composition between historical and recent records in a same vegetation type was tested with the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity. This index computes the beta‐diversity between a given record and all the others during the same time period, considering their respective species composition and cover. Means of dissimilarity indices were computed for each record separately for historical and recent surveys. Pairwise Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare temporal differences between medians of Simpson diversity indices and mean Bray–Curtis dissimilarities. The Wilcoxon test was applied firstly in the bilateral mode, and, if it gave a significant result, the unilateral mode was applied as well. The 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐values reported in the text refer to the unilateral mode.
