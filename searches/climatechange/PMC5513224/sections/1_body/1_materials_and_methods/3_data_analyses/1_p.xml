<p class="p">The potential mistakes in species identifications, or changes in nomenclature and aggregation level between the two periods, were corrected by a scrupulous check of possible synonymies and by aggregating the pairs of species with frequent confusions into the same taxon. One frequent problem in plant monitoring studies is the overlooked species in one of the surveys (Vittoz and Guisan

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This bias is particularly likely to cause artifact in this study, as recent inventories involved generally two botanists instead of one in the historical records, and because the historical inventories, especially those of Richard et al.

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>), were not performed for monitoring purposes, but for the classification of plant communities. Changes in diversity between pairs of records were not expressed in terms of species richness but using the Simpson diversity index, which is less sensitive to the species with low cover. This is justified in order to minimize the influence of a possible bias related to the fact that species with very low cover are mainly those overlooked (Vittoz and Guisan
