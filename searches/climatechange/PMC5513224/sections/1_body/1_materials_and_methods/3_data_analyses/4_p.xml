<p class="p">The difference between recent and historical species frequencies was calculated and tested with a restricted permutation test following Kapfer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) within each plant community. Treating historical and recent inventories separately, the occurrences of each plant species among plots were shuffled randomly 999 times and new frequencies were calculated for each repetition. Significance levels were assessed by counting the number of times the changes in frequency between random historical and recent data was larger or equal to the observed changes in frequency between observed historical and recent data. For the species present simultaneously in at least 25% of the historical and recent inventories, a mean cover was calculated considering only the plots where the species was observed. Changes in mean cover were tested with the same restricted permutation test used for species frequency but using the mean cover values instead (Kapfer et al.
