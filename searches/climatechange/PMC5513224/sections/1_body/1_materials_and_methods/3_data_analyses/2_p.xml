<p class="p">Two conversions of Braun‐Blanquet's scale were used for subsequent analyses. The Braun‐Blanquet's scale was converted into the median of the cover class (Table

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) were used because they preserve the importance of the less abundant species, a crucial point in such analyses, by reducing the weight given to dominant ones (high cover).
