<p class="p">Impacts of the recent climate change on alpine vegetation have been largely recorded by many long‐term studies on European upper alpine and nival summits. Authors observed an increase in species richness during the last century (see Stöckli et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref> for a review), already noticeable on a shorter timescale (2001–2008; Pauli et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The newly arrived species are subalpine and lower alpine species (Vittoz et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008a</xref>; Engler et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and now, because of longer growing seasons, they are able to grow at higher elevations. Space on the summits is not a constraint to colonization as it is widely available. However, the upward shift of plant species led not only to higher species number, but also to a homogenization of plant composition across Alpine Swiss summits (Jurasinski and Kreyling

Similarly, vegetation of the high northern latitudes has been changing over the past few decades and a general increase in biomass and proliferation of shrub species are responsible for the tundra “greening” (see Epstein et al.
