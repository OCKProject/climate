<p class="p">It has been demonstrated that nitrogen deposition causes a decrease in species richness in the Swiss montane grasslands, with oligotrophic, and usually rare, species being particularly disfavored (Roth et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Subalpine and alpine grasslands are likely more vulnerable to negative effects of N deposition, as they have shorter growing seasons and generally thinner and nutrient poorer soils (Bowman et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, increased N depositions may have different consequences between habitats: using a plant trait analysis, Maskell et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) showed that eutrophication and acidification occurred, both of which can be responsible for species loss. Indeed, in a moss‐dominated alpine heath of Northern Europe, N deposition seems to trigger a decline of plant diversity and of shrub, bryophyte and lichen covers, but an increase in the graminoid cover (Armitage et al.
