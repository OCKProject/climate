<p class="p">For the purpose of this study, 63 exhaustive plant inventories performed on six plant community types during the period 1964–1990 and located between the subalpine and alpine belts of the Swiss Alps have been revisited. Through a time comparison of species frequencies and cover, and with the help of indicator values, the following questions are targeted: (1) Are there observable changes in the subalpine–alpine vegetation over the last 25–50 years in species richness and community composition in the Alps? (2) Do the magnitude and direction of changes vary across different plant communities and how? (3) What are the environmental conditions that can explain the observed changes?</p>
