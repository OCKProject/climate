<p class="p">A powerful and widely used tool to identify factors driving the vegetation changes is the species indicator values of Landolt et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) for the flora in the Alps or those of Ellenberg et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>) in Central Europe. These semiquantitative parameters, although inferred from field experience and not from direct measurements, have been shown to give pertinent indications of the species ecological optima within small spatial areas in Alpine landscapes (Scherrer and Körner 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Specifically, the temperature indicator value is significantly correlated with the average soil temperature, which is far more representative of actual conditions experienced by low‐stature alpine plants than the air temperature interpolated from meteorological stations (Scherrer and Körner
