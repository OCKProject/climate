<p class="p">At these elevations, the effects of climate and land‐use changes are difficult to disentangle. Indeed, seasonal grazing has been decreasing and many pastures have been abandoned since the end of the nineteenth century (Bätzing

 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008b</xref>) and favored the arrival of plants from fallow and wood edge communities in the subalpine grasslands (Vittoz et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, as a result of industrial, traffic, and agronomic emissions, tropospheric concentrations of nitrogen compounds have increased remarkably, reaching levels that are likely to affect the aboveground productivity of alpine plants (Bassin et al.
