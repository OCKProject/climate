<p class="p">During the end of the 20th century (1975–2004), the mean annual temperature in Switzerland increased by 0.57°C per decade with a stronger trend in spring and summer seasons (Rebetez and Reinhard 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). After a gradual increase until the early 1980s, snow precipitation in Switzerland significantly decreased (Laternser and Schneebeli 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) with a particularly pronounced trend at lower elevations (501–800 m a.s.l., Serquet et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Snowfall decreased above 1700 m as well, but only at the beginning and at the end of the winter season (Serquet et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). At such elevations, winter temperatures are generally much lower than the melting point, and, even with warmer conditions, there is little potential for a decrease in snowfall days (Serquet et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). By contrast, the combination of higher temperatures and lower snowfalls during the spring season results in a lower snow cover (IPCC,
