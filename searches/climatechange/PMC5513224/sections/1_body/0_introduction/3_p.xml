<p class="p">Many more uncertainties exist about the effects of climate warming at lower elevations. A shift of tree line northwards and to higher elevations is the most often observed change on European mountain ranges (see Garamvoelgyi and Hufnagel 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref> for a review). In the Swiss Alps, the forest limit moved upward with a mean decadal increment of 28 m between 1985 and 1997 (Gehrig‐Fasel et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32354-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). However, between tree line and the upper alpine–nival belt, there is a wide range of plant communities whose responses to altered temperatures and precipitations have been poorly investigated so far. This is unfortunate, as identifying the most threatened plant communities is very important to establish proper conservation measures. Some previous long‐term surveys focused on changes of specific plant community, such as alpine siliceous grasslands (Dupré et al.
