<p id="Par6" class="p">The flowering time of the newest cultivar was 11 and 14 days earlier than the flowering time of older cultivars in first and second years of the field experiment, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). We also found that the PVTTs until flowering (PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub>) of the new cultivars were 18% and 14% lower than the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> of the old cultivars in the first and second years of the field experiment, respectively, whereas the differences in the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> of the cultivars released before 1972 were small and did not show a clear trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). The cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> ranged from 554 °C day to 711 °C day and 560 °C day to 768 °C day based on the phenology observations obtained from the first and second years of the field experiment, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). If the other 11 parameters of the phenology model were well selected, then the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> should be a cultivar-specific constant, but we found that the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> of the same cultivars differed between the two years by up to 62 °C day or 9% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). To quantify the corresponding uncertainties, we performed a cross validation by simulating the cultivar-specific flowering day in the specific years by using a cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> calculated for the other year and comparing the simulated flowering day with the observed flowering day (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>).
