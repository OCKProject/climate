<p id="Par8" class="p">The PVTT from emergence to heading (PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub>) calculated from the observations for western Germany showed similar trends, with a 15% smaller PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> in the most recent years than before 1986, which did not show a significant trend (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Therefore, both the cultivar experiments and the regional phenology observations provided evidence that the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> required for crop development in the vegetative phase declined considerably over the past three to four decades.
