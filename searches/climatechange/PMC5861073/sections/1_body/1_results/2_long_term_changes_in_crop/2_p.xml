<p id="Par9" class="p">A significant negative trend (−4.1 days per decade) was detected for the heading day for the period 1972–2013 across western Germany, whereas the trend in heading day was not significant for the period before 1972 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The negative trend in heading day showed a similar spatial pattern across the region for the period 1972–2013 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Significant negative trends were also detected for the day of emergence and the length of the vegetative phase (emergence-heading) of winter wheat (Supplementary Figure
