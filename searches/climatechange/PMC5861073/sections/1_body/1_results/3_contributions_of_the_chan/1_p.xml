<p id="Par10" class="p">Temperature increases alone resulted in a negative but non-significant heading day trend of −2.3 to −2.4 days per decade (depending on the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> used for the parameterization) in the heading day simulated for the period 1972–2013 for western Germany and therefore explained only half of the observed trend in heading day for that period, which was −4.1 days per decade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Running the model with year and grid-specific sowing dates explained another (7%) of the trend in the simulated heading day (trend of −2.6 days per decade, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Running the model with a cultivar-dependent PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> for the specific cultivars derived from the field experiments resulted in a negative, significant heading day trend of −4.0 days per decade for the period 1972–2013, which reproduced the observed trend (−4.1 days per decade) almost exactly when using the cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> from the 2015/2016 season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Employing the cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> using the data obtained in the cultivar experiment for the 2016/2017 season slightly overestimated the declining heading day trend (−5.0 days per decade simulated vs −4.1 days per decade observed, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The accuracy of the model simulations for the period from 1972–2013 where we found a negative trend in PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> also improved when we considered the combined effects of climate, sowing date and cultivar (NRMSE = 42% and 48%, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.82) compared with simulations that only considered the effects of climate (NRMSE = 51% and 90%, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.74) when using the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> obtained from the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 seasons, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
