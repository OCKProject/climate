<p id="Par4" class="p">Disentangling the effects of climate change, sowing dates and cultivars on crop phenology is difficult because information on the changes of cultivar properties related to their phenological development is very limited. Variety trials compare different cultivars, but only recent cultivars are usually tested. Changes in the development rates of cultivars cannot be detected in these trials. Therefore, phenology models that were applied in previous studies assumed no change in cultivar properties but used climate change and sowing date to simulate changes in crop phenology caused by a changing climate. Although rarely considered, the effects of cultivar changes can be derived indirectly as the difference between the observed changes in crop phenology and the trends simulated with the phenology model

 </sup>. The accuracy of the results obtained by using such an approach is determined primarily by the parameterization of the phenology model used in the study. For crops such as winter wheat, the vernalization requirement and the sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature must also be considered but are often not known for specific cultivars, which introduces considerable uncertainty in the study results.
