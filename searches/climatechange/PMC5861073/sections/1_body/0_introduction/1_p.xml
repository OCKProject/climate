 </sup>. Although the changes in the phenology of natural vegetation and forests correspond well with the warming pattern, the changes in the phenology observed for annual crops have been more diverse because the effects of climate change on crop phenology have interacted with the effects of changes in crop management, such as modified sowing dates and changing cultivars
