<p id="Par5" class="p">The objective of the present study was to quantify the contributions of changes in cultivars, sowing dates and temperature to the changes in the phenology of winter wheat. In addition to long-term observations of crop phenology in western Germany, we parameterized a phenology model

 </sup> with cultivar-specific information obtained in a two-year variety trial by directly comparing historic and modern cultivars. We detected cultivar differences in the length of the period between emergence and flowering by growing 12 winter wheat varieties released over the past 60 years in Germany (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) in parallel at the Long-term Field Experiment Dikopshof near Cologne in western Germany. The selected cultivars represented popular varieties commonly grown in western Germany, typically for a period lasting approximately 10–15 years after their release. We applied the crop phenology model using the data collected in the two-year field experiment to calculate the cultivar-specific photo-vernal-thermal time (PVTT) required between emergence and flowering (PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub>), which is the temperature sum corrected for the effects of photoperiod and vernalization. A piecewise linear regression was used to determine trends in the PVTT caused by the historical change in the cultivars. To test whether trends in the PVTT obtained from the cultivar experiment were representative for all of western Germany, we analyzed the long-term trends in the emergence dates and heading dates observed across the region for the period from 1952–2013 that were obtained from the German Meteorological Service and the derived trends in the PVTT from emergence to heading, and we compared the trends in the PVTTs obtained for the region with those caused by cultivar changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Subsequently, we used the crop phenology model, high-resolution climate data

 </sup> and sowing day observations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup> to quantify the effect of changes in cultivars, sowing dates and temperature on the heading day of winter wheat. We focused on the effects of these factors on heading day because many crops are particularly sensitive to abiotic stresses such as drought, heat or frost in the period around heading or flowering.
