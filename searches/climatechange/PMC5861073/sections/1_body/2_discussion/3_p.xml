<p id="Par13" class="p">We kept all the photoperiod and vernalization parameters in the phenology model constant and only changed the PVTT parameter to consider the effects of cultivar changes for long-term simulations. To test the suitability of this procedure, we performed a sensitivity analysis by adjusting the parameters related to the photoperiod and vernalization or the thermal requirements of the cultivars to reproduce days of flowering in the 2015/2016 season. Then, the parameter sets were applied to simulate flowering dates in the 2016/2017 season, and the simulated and observed days of flowering were compared. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that phenology change is parameterized best by varying the thermal requirements of the cultivars, resulting in the lowest errors and a good reproduction of the trend in phenology (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). A calibration based on the base photoperiod also reproduced the trend in phenology across the cultivars, but it was less precise in comparison to the calibration for the thermal requirements. In contrast, the calibration for vernalization days did not yield realistic parameters and was not able to reproduce the difference across the cultivars (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The phenology model was less precise when simulating the flowering dates of the old cultivars released before 1980 in the second year of the field experiment by using the PVTT obtained in the first year of the experiment, while the flowering days of the modern cultivars were well reproduced (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3a</xref>). This result indicates that the photoperiod and vernalization characteristics of the old cultivars differed from those of the modern cultivars. Therefore, the performance of the model can further be improved by adjusting the 2 photoperiod parameters in the model or the 6 parameters for vernalization. However, this calibration would require extended experimentation with different photoperiod and temperature combinations, which could be the objective of future research.
