<p id="Par14" class="p">Separately utilizing the two datasets for the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 seasons obtained from field experiments to parameterize the phenology model for the long-term simulations resulted in 5-day differences in the simulated heading day for both, simulations considering the climate effect and simulations considering climate and sowing day effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). There was little difference in the trend for the simulated heading day parametrized by the two datasets over the last 62 years when we only considered climate and sowing effects after the breakpoint (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). However, there was a difference of 1 day per decade between the trend of the heading day simulated by two sets of parameters when the combined climate, sowing and cultivar effects were considered in the period 1972–2013 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The potential reason for this difference in the model results of the two parameter sets could be the limited number of cultivars used to establish the trend for the period 1972–2013 (seven cultivars). Specifically, the most recent cultivar Premio showed very early flowering in the 2016/2017 season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>), which influenced the trend for the whole period. Repeating the experiment with more cultivars is therefore suggested to obtain more robust trend estimates.
