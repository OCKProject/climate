<p id="Par15" class="p">More research is needed to determine whether our findings can be generalized for other regions. Other research has shown that the required temperature sum for the flowering of modern durum wheat cultivars grown in Italy was significantly smaller than that for the old cultivars due to the reduction in photoperiod sensitivity and cold requirement

 </sup>. The photoperiod sensitivity allele

 </sup>. The faster development of new cultivars during the vegetative phase could also reduce heat and drought stress during the flowering period by shifting the flowering date to the cooler part of the growing season

 </sup>. However, plant breeders are also facing other challenges such as avoiding crop damage due to frost events in the late spring when introducing early-flowering cultivars, specifically for western European conditions. Frost events that occur after the reproductive phase beings could result in a large decline in yield or even crop failure. Therefore, the current climate variability that occurs in the major winter wheat growing areas needs to be considered in breeding efforts.
