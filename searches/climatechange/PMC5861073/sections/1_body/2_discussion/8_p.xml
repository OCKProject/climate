<p id="Par18" class="p">Although our results clearly showed that winter wheat cultivars released in the past four decades in Germany were adjusted toward earlier heading and flowering, the underlying physiological relationships that explain these changes and their interactions with the environment remain unknown. In general, the factors considered include vernalization requirements and effectiveness, sensitivity to photoperiod, sensitivity of the development rate to temperature or a combination of these factors. Identifying the reasons for the changes in the phenological characteristics of the cultivars (due to changes in vernalization requirements and sensitivity, photoperiod sensitivity or temperature requirements or combinations of these factors) and the genetic modifications required to implement these changes is not an objective of this study. Identifying this information would require additional data and different methods and could be the objective of subsequent research. It is also not clear whether the detected changes in cultivar properties are an intended or unintended response to the already changing climate or whether the phenological properties of the cultivars have been modified as a result of breeding towards other common targets such as better grain quality or higher resistance against pests and diseases. Finally, a better understanding is required to determine the extent that our results can be generalized for other crops.</p>
