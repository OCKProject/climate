<p id="Par12" class="p">Our findings indicate that directly linking temperature increases to changes in phenology results in an overestimate of the sensitivity of crop phenology to changing temperatures for the region and crop studied here. Therefore, generally ignoring cultivar effects could introduce error in the climate impact assessment results. In most of the long-term impact assessment modeling studies performed at a large scale, crop phenology is parameterized based on field experiments that were conducted over the past 10 years, and a single parameter set is usually used to simulate crop phenology. Therefore, exploring changes in factors such as heat stress intensity or drought stress could be biased by the effects that cultivar changes have on crop phenology
