<p id="Par16" class="p">Our results also indicate that the modification of crop phenology by cultivar change should be reflected in assessments of potential future crop phenology and crop productivity. Although effects of future breeding strategies on crop phenology are difficult to project, introducing a range of different PVTTs, for example by probabilistic modeling, could be a possible solution.</p>
