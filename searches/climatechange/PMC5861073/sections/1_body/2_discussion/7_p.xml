<p id="Par17" class="p">Further research is required to test the effects of cultivar change on the length of the subsequent reproductive phase of winter wheat. Shortening the vegetative phase may not necessarily translate to a decline in the length of the entire growing season of new winter wheat cultivars. Alternatively, shortening the vegetative period could also be compensated by an increase in the length of the reproductive period. The length of the reproductive phases of new cultivars of winter rapeseed and maize for example, have significantly increased during the past 30 years in Germany

 </sup>, respectively. The trend detected for the day of yellow ripeness (−0.31 days per year) of winter wheat was more negative than the trend detected for the heading day (−0.20 days per year) for Germany and the period from 1951–2004
