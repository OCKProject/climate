 </sup> for the period from 1951 to 2013. Mean values and standard deviations for the phenological stages were calculated for each of the 86 eco-regions in Germany to filter out potential outliers

 </sup>. We restricted our analysis to 8 federal states in western Germany because the time series of observations was incomplete for the other states. The total number of observations after applying the filtering process was 495,219 from 4824 sites across the study region. We interpolated phenology observations for each year to a 1 km × 1 km grid using a modified inverse distance weighting method and accounted for the spatial variability in temperature and day length between the observed points and the corresponding effect on the spatial pattern of the phenological stages

 </sup>. The spatial interpolation was applied to reduce the effects caused by the heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal distribution of the observations to obtain uniform data coverage across time and space. There were only a few stations that had complete data coverage for all the phenological stages and the whole study period. A cropland mask, which was based on the 2006 CORINE land-cover classification
