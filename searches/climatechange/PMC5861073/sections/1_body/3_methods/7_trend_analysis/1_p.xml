<p id="Par27" class="p">Trends in the timing of the observed and simulated phenological stages, observed PVTT and spring temperature (March-June) were analyzed by a segmented, piecewise linear regression

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>, because previous research identified different rates of change in temperature and crop phenology for the years before the 1970s and the period after the 1970s for the region in this study

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. The trend in the vegetative period length was analyzed via a simple linear regression due to the high inter-annual variability in the observations. To avoid the strong inter-annual variability in crop phenology resulting in artificial break points close to the beginning or the end of the study period, we only accepted break points in the period from 1961 to 2004

 </sup>. The trend analysis of the mean temperature was restricted to the spring period, because this period is considered the phase when the vernalization requirement of winter wheat is fulfilled, the photoperiod is less limiting, and the crop development rates are therefore particularly sensitive to daily temperature.
