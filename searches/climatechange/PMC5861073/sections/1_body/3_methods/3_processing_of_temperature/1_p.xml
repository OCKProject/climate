<p id="Par21" class="p">The daily mean temperature for more than 1100 weather stations and interpolated grids of monthly mean temperatures at a 1 km × 1 km resolution for the period from 1951 to 2013 were obtained from the WebWerdis portal of the German Meteorological Service

 </sup>. The daily mean temperature was computed for each 1 km × 1 km grid cell and for each day of the period from 1951 to 2013

 </sup>. Similar to the processing of the phenological data, the cropland mask was applied to the 1 km × 1 km daily temperature grids, and any subsequent analyses were constrained to the grid cells containing cropland.
