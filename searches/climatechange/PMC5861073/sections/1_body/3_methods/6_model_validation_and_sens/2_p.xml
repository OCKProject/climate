<p id="Par26" class="p">A sensitivity analysis was conducted to test how well the differences among the cultivars can be reproduced by adjusting parameters related to either temperature and photoperiod or the vernalization requirements. The required PVTT, base photoperiod and maximum number of vernalization days were selected as target parameters. Consequently, three sets of parameters including fixed photoperiod and vernalization but cultivar-specific thermal requirement (PVTT_T), fixed vernalization and thermal requirement but cultivar-specific base photoperiod (PVTT_P) and fixed photoperiod and thermal requirement but cultivar-specific vernalization days (PVTT_V) were employed for each cultivar to test the sensitivity of the cultivars to temperature, photoperiod and vernalization (Supplementary TableÂ
