<p id="Par25" class="p">The cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> was calculated for the first and second year of the field experiment separately by keeping the other parameters of the phenology model constant (Supplementary FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). To test how well this approach can reproduce observed flowering days, a cross-validation model was carried out by simulating the cultivar specific flowering day in the specific growing seasons by using the cultivar-specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> calculated for the other year and comparing the simulated flowering day with the observed flowering day.
