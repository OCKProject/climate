<p id="Par24" class="p">At the first step of the modeling experiment, we calculated the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> and PVTT
 <sub class="sub">heading</sub> of specific cultivars using the observations from the field experiment (2015/2016 and 2016/2017) and the regional phenology observations (1952–2013), respectively. The trends in both time series were compared to determine whether the cultivars grown in the field experiment were representative of the phenological characteristics of the cultivars used historically in western Germany. Next, we modeled the heading day with different model scenarios to separate the effects of management decisions (changing sowing date and cultivars) on crop phenology from the effects of climate change on phenology. We assumed a difference in the PVTT of 60 °C day as the required temperature sum from heading to flowering to convert between the beginning of flowering simulated with the phenology model and the beginning of heading reported in the variety trials conducted by the Federal Plant Variety Office (Bundessortenamt). To analyze the sole effect of climate on crop phenology, we ran the model with a fixed emergence date and fixed PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> (average PVTT of all cultivars) obtained from the observations in the field experiment. The combined effects of the climate and sowing date on crop phenology were assessed by executing the model using year- and grid-specific emergence dates and fixed PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub>. Finally, the combined effects of climate change, sowing date and cultivars on crop phenology were evaluated using the model with the year- and grid-specific emergence date and cultivar- specific PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> for each single grid cell (1 km × 1 km). The year- and grid-specific emergence date was prepared based on the observations for each single grid cell and year at a 1 km × 1 km resolution. The cultivar-dependent PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> for each year was obtained from the trend in the PVTT
 <sub class="sub">flowering</sub> of the field experiment (Fig.
