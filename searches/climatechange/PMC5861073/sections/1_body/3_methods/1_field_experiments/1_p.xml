<p id="Par19" class="p">In 1904, a static long-term NKPCa fertilization field experiment was established at the Dikopshof near Cologne, Germany (50°48′ 21″ North, longitude: 6°59′ 9″ East, altitude: 62 m), which is characterized by an Atlantic climate with mild winters and summers, a mean annual temperature of 10.5 °C and a mean annual precipitation of 688 mm (1951–2015). The very fertile soil is a humous fine sandy loam formed from loess with a depth of approximately 100 cm. The Haplic (Chromic) Luvisol developed from the loess layer over a sandy-stony, highly permeable Pleistocene middle terrace of the Rhine River

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 31 kg P ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 116 kg K ha

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), representing cultivars typical of the region that were grown as part of the long-term experiment. Crop phenology observations were conducted for the period from sowing to the end of flowering with observations taken at two-day intervals for the period around the heading day in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Phenology was recorded according to the BBCH scale

 </sup>. Obvious visual differences in the phenological stages of the old and new cultivars were observed (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). We observed ten plants in the center of each plot that contained 11 rows of plants without replication, and whenever the stamens appeared in more than five plants, the date was recorded as the end of flowering.
