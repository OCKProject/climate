<p class="p">Model‐averaged estimates derived from the 90% model set agreed with the best approximating model with two variables: talus area cover and crevice depth, which were detected as significant predictors for diet richness; each having RI values of 1.0. Talus area has significant positive influence on plant diet richness. However, crevice depth showed a negative influence on plant richness (Table
