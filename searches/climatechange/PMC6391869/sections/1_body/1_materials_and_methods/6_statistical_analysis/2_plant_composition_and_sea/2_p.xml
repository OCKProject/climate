<p class="p">We compared the plant diet composition at family and genera level. We used multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP; Mielke, Berry, &amp; Johnson,

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>) to understand seasonal variation in diet composition at plant genera level across multiple sites. We used contingency table analysis to test for heterogeneity in plant family in diet across sites, which was assessed by G tests followed by partitioned analyses (Sokal &amp; Rohlf, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). In addition, we have used generalized linear models (GLMs) to understand the effect of elevation on plant diet richness (number of genera) across seasons and comparison of plant families across sites sampled in the same season. The significance of fixed effects was evaluated with Wald's chi‐square tests (Bolker et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). To understand whether relative contribution of vegetation type (forbs, grass, shrub and tree) in pika diet is proportional to their availability in the environment, we conducted compositional analysis (Aebischer, Robertson, &amp; Kenward,
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) using Adehabitat v 1.8.20 package in R (Calenge, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). We restricted our analysis to the vegetation types which qualified within the criteria of a minimum of two data points greater than zero per vegetation category in the environment data set (Calenge, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). In addition, the contribution of each plant genus to overall pika diet with their corresponding evolutionary origin and distribution range was visually explored using box plots.
