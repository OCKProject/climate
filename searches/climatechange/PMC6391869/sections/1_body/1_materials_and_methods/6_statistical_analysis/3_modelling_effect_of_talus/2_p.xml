<p class="p">We investigated the effect of food availability (tree, shrub, grass and forbs cover), predation risk (talus area, distance between talus, and depth of crevices) and talus topography (elevation, aspect and slope) on plant diet richness. We fitted 32 GLM models and used AIC‐based multimodel inference to identify well‐supported statistical models that describe the relationships between plant diet richness and biological parameters relevant to foraging ecology of Royle's pika (Table 
 <xref rid="mec14842-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Season was not incorporated as an explanatory variable in the model as not all sites were surveyed in both seasons. Model averaging was conducted using the MuMin v package in R (Barton &amp; Barton, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) on the model set generated from the global model, applying a threshold‐corrected Akaike's information criterion (ΔAICc; Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) to select the best candidate model based on the lowest (AIC) values corrected for sample size bias or AICc values (ΔAICc) &gt; 2 units than the quality of other competing models. Alternatively, when two or more models had difference in AICc &lt; 2, we used multimodel‐averaged estimates to check the validity of the top ranking model in each case, only including models with ΔAICc &lt; 2 (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The relative importance (RI) of each parameter after model averaging was calculated by summing Akaike's weight (

We tested for possible collinearity of the explanatory variables using Pearson's correlation analysis in the global model; the mean correlation was 0.14, and the strongest was 0.64. Correlated variables were used only in interactive models but not in additive models (Graham, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). All analyses were conducted in R v 3.3.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
