<p class="p">We amplified the ITS2 region of plant nuclear DNA using primer pair UniPlantF (5′‐TGTGAATTGCARRATYCMG‐3′) and UniPlantR (5′‐CCCGHYTGAYYTGRGGTCDC‐3′; 187–380 bp; Moorhouse‐Gann et al.,

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Primers had overhang adapter sequences added to the 5′ end for the initial PCR amplification, following Campbell, Harmon, and Narum (
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This allows unique 6 bp dual index sequences to be added along with Illumina capture sequences to each sample in a subsequent PCR step prior to pooling samples for sequencing. Initial PCR amplifications were performed in 10 μL reaction volumes including 5 μL of Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), 1 μL of each primer (1 μM), 2 μL of nuclease‐free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 1 μL of DNA template. Reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min; 44 cycles of 94°C for 90 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s; and final extension of 72°C for 10 min. We used DNA from Quaking grass (

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The PCR products amplified by each primer pair were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Safe, amplicon size was compared to a 100 bp ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK), and amplification success was assessed. In addition, each PCR product was quantified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to accurately estimate the amplicon size and DNA concentration. Only amplicons with clear visible band following electrophoresis were processed further. The ITS2 and 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> PCR products were pooled in equal amounts and quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to ensure approximately equal amounts of amplicon DNA were used in the second amplification step to attach the Illumina tags. This PCR amplification was performed in a 10 μL reaction volume including 5 μL of Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), 0.5 μL of forward and reverse Illumina Multiplex Identifier (MID) tagged or indexed primers (1 μM), 2 μL DNase and nuclease‐free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 4 μL of DNA template (pika faecal sample or pooled PCR product from previous ITS2 and 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> amplification). Reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min; 10 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s; and final extension of 72°C for 5 min. The concentrations of these PCR products (2 μL) were measured using a fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) and pooled together in batches of eight samples with similar concentrations. Each batch of pooled samples was then purified following the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR Purification Kit protocol (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Aus.) to remove nontarget DNA fragments and primer dimer and eluted in 40 μL of ultrapure water (Murray, Coghlan, &amp; Bunce, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Each cleaned pool was then analysed on a Tape Station (Agilent Technologies, USA) to check for successful removal of primer dimer. Each pool was then serially diluted and quantified using quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) where a diluted custom synthetic oligonucleotide of known molarity was used as standard to determine the final volume of library to use for sequencing. The qPCR amplification was performed in a 25 μL volume containing KAPPA library quantification kit (Kappa Biosystem, Inc.), 0.4 μM of specific forward and reverse primer and 2 μL of pooled amplicon library and using these reaction conditions: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 60°C for 45 s. Based on the cycle threshold (CT) values observed, each pool of eight samples were combined in equimolar proportions (4 nM) to make a single library with unique Illumina tagged PCR product for all 124 samples to run using the 500 cycle v2 (2 × 250 bp paired‐end reads) sequencing kit on the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
