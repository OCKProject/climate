<p class="p">The Royle's pika's diet is rich in secondary metabolites (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which often inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions in polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Weishing, Nybom, Wolff, &amp; Meyer, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Therefore, we homogenized 20–30 mg of the faecal samples and extracted DNA using QiAamp DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following minor modifications in the manufacturer's protocol (e.g., overnight incubation at 56°C with ASL stool lysis buffer; Qiagen Inc., Germany). As Royle's pika were the only lagomorph species present in the study area (Bhattacharyya,

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>) with very distinct faecal pellets, the chances of misidentification of the faecal samples were ruled out.
