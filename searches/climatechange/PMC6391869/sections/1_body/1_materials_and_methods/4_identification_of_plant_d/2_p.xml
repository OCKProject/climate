<p class="p">The bioinformatic analyses were performed using Iceberg, the High Performance Computing Cluster at the University of Sheffield, UK. The paired‐end reads were filtered for quality (minimum quality score 20 over a 4 bp sliding window) and any Illumina adapter sequences removed using Trimmomatic v 0.32 (Bolger, Lohse, &amp; Usadel, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), retaining only reads of at least 90 bp in length. For ITS2, filtered sequences were then aligned using FLASH (Magoč &amp; Salzberg, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), aligned sequences with matches to the ITS2 primer sequences only were extracted, and primer sequences were removed using the “trim_seqs” command in Mothur (Schloss et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The ITS2 region was extracted from the whole amplicon sequence (which includes ~73 bp of 5.8S rDNA sequence, Moorhouse‐Gann et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) using ITSx (Bengtsson‐Palme et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The “derep_fulllength” and “uchime2_denovo” commands were used in 
 <sc class="sc">usearch</sc> software v 9.2.64 (Edgar, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) to eliminate all sequences which had less than 10 copies per sample and any chimeric sequences. Each unique ITS2 sequence found in the data set was then compared against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>) to assign a taxonomic unit for each plant sequenced identified. Only matches with at least a 97% identity to the reference sequence were retained for downstream analysis. The software 
 <sc class="sc">metagenome analyzer</sc> v 4 (MEGAN, Huson et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) was used against NCBI taxonomic framework for mapping and visualization of the BLAST results, keeping all default parameters for the LCA assignment algorithm except the bit score minimum support threshold, which was set at 1%. For 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic>, the analysis pipeline differed slightly as we did not expect a region of overlap between the paired sequencing reads with these ~550 bp long amplicons. Instead, we used a custom script to reverse complement read 2 and combine with read 1 to form an 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> sequence starting and ending with the primer sequences but having at least a 50 bp gap in the middle. Prior to performing the BLAST search, we also clustered the dereplicated and nonchimeric at 97% sequence similarity using the “cluster_fast” commands in usearch. Owing to limited reference plant database from the Himalayan region, we were able to identify plants only at genus level. The reliability of each molecular operational taxonomic unit (mOTU) corresponding to a specific plant genus was further evaluated against a published list of plants reported from the study area (Bhattacharya, Sathyakumar, &amp; Rawat, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Rai, Adhikari, &amp; Rawat, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and online plant [e.g., flora Himalaya database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leca.univ-savoie.fr/db/florhy/infos.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.leca.univ-savoie.fr/db/florhy/infos.html</ext-link>), Dobremez et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">[Link]</xref>] and biodiversity databases [e.g., The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gbif.org/</ext-link>)], which provided information on elevation and geographic range of the plant genus. Plant genera not reported from the Himalayan region were not considered for further analysis.
