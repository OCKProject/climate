<p class="p">This is the first study of the diet for any Himalayan pika species that uses noninvasive sampling and metabarcoding. It allowed us to quantify genus richness and revealed cryptic aspects of functional diversity and useful insights into niche partitioning across an elevational gradient. Our study provides an excellent example of how DNA metabarcoding can be used in understanding diet and feeding preferences of an elusive herbivore species found in fragmented alpine terrain and is applicable for other herbivores dependent on C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plants. We found DNA metabarcoding outperformed traditional methods by revealing the huge diversity of plant genera consumed by pikas and their reliance on species endemic to the Himalayas. Earlier studies based on traditional visual and microscopic observation reported only 22 food plant genera for Royle's pika (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), whereas our DNA metabarcoding results indicated more than 70 plant genera in the diet, which includes all of the 22 plant genera reported earlier. Forbs constituted the highest proportion of the diet. We demonstrate quantitative estimates of relative consumption of plant genera and capture fine‐scale distribution across an elevational gradient, which has been difficult to detect using traditional methods of diet analysis. In addition, diet plant richness in the premonsoon season varied significantly across sites and decreased in higher elevation sites. We also demonstrate the effects of habitat characteristics, such as talus area and depth of crevices between rocks, on the genus richness in the Royle's pika's diet.
