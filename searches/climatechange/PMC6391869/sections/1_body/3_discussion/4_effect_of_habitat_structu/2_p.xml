<p class="p">In western Himalayan Royle's pika populations, plant diet richness increased with large talus area, whereas depth of crevices between rocks had a negative effect on plant diet richness. Plant richness in pika diet increased with talus area as larger areas have higher plant diversity (area–richness relationship). Large talus areas provide good cover and habitat both in terms of food availability and refuge from predators. Large talus provides pikas with many escape routes from predators, allowing pikas to forage on surrounding meadows and reduce the dependence on the availability of local vegetation. This may explain the higher plant diet richness that was observed, as predation risk plays an important role in determining the food selection in Royle's pika (Bhattacharyya et al.,
