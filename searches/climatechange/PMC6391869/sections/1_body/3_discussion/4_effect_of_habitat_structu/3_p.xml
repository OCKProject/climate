<p class="p">Predation risk has significant impacts on prey populations, either by direct predation‐mediated mortality or indirectly by altering their physiology and behaviour (Lima,

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Large talus areas with high rock cover and vegetation help in forage selection by reducing other constraints such as energy demands (Stephens &amp; Krebs, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). Pikas balance predation risk associated with foraging activity against nutritional quality and availability of diet plants, a typical strategy found in central place foragers by exploiting nearby talus habitats (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Huntly et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>; Morrison, Barton, Caputa, &amp; Hik, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Smith, Formozov, Hoffmann, Changlin, &amp; Erbajeva, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). Large rock talus fields with crevices possibly act as escape cover from predators and allow pikas to access extended foraging grounds and diverse array of food plants, and hence have a positive influence on diet richness. Furthermore, Royle's pikas are sensitive to high temperature, and stable microclimate talus habitat serves as a refuge from harsh climate as well as predators (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014b</xref>). Royle's pika utilizes crevices in their talus habitat to build their nests (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The structure of rock talus and availability of small crevices (&lt; 15 cm) appear to govern occupancy of Royle's pika habitat as it reduces predation risk; wide crevices probably make it easier for predators such as weasels and red foxes to catch pikas (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We found deep crevices had a negative effect on plant diet richness. The negative effect of deep crevices probably indicates foraging under fear response. The deep crevices often also have wider openings that increase predation risk from small size predators such as weasels and red foxes (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Hence, pikas inhabiting talus with deep crevices probably utilize the foraging ground less extensively and have a narrow choice of plants. This could be a mechanism behind the avoidance of such taluses as restricted diet can further reduce individual fitness. These findings are in line with previous studies on the Royle's pika and other talus‐dwelling pikas, which tend to forage close to the talus habitat where predation risk is the least, and venture out to open meadows to forage only when talus patches are well connected (Bhattacharyya et al.,
