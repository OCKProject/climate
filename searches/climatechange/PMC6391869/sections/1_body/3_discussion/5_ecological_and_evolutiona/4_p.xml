<p class="p">India holds 28% of the flora which is endemic to the Himalayan region (Chitale, Behera, &amp; Roy, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We found a high dependency of the Royle's pika on endemic plants, and 53%–64% of dietary plant genera (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Geum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fragaria</italic>) are endemic to the Himalayan region. Increases in summer temperature and precipitation and the frequency of freeze–thaw cycles are predicted to have detrimental, multidimensional and spatially variable impact on these endemic alpine plants (Dolezal et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Recent research has suggested around 23.9% to 41.34% reduction in the distribution of endemic plants in various biodiversity hotspots in Himalaya by 2080 (Chitale et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, changes in the distribution and abundance of Himalayan endemic plants might have significant negative impacts on the overall nutritional ecology of the Royle's pika. Lack of a plant genetic reference library from the Himalayan region, especially from our study site, did not allow us to achieve species‐level identification of pika diet. Future research is needed to build a plant genetic resource reference library for insights to be gained at the plant species level.
