<p class="p">Alpine species adapted to cold climatic conditions are more vulnerable to global warming (Hughes, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Moritz et al. (
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) indicated significant changes in distributions and range contraction in mountain‐dwelling small mammals. Walther et al. (
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) predicted upslope range shifts in animals to cope with changing (warming) environmental conditions. However, habitat fragmentation might not allow small mammals such as pikas to move their ranges fast enough to track shifts in suitable microclimates (Ray et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Schloss, Nuñez, &amp; Lawler, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Given that the Royle's pika can cope with physiological stress (e.g., hypoxia) in high‐elevation environments, the upper limit of the distribution of diet plants (&gt; 4,500 m) could still pose a threat to their survival and fitness. Isolated high altitude mountain habitats, also known as “Sky‐islands,” differ significantly in environmental conditions from intervening valleys (Shepard &amp; Burbrink, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). These intervening valleys were found to have significant impacts on the dispersal of cold‐adapted mountain‐dwelling species, such as pikas, across sky‐islands (Galbreath, Hafner, Zamudio, &amp; Agnew, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Hence, the Royle's pika would potentially need to travel across the lowland valleys to find favourable habitat to cope with the changing environment. Apart from high sensitivity to warm environments (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014b</xref>) and predation risk (Bhattacharyya et al., 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), absence of diet plants below 1,500 m elevation might hamper such contemporary migration through lowland valleys. Furthermore, loss of distribution range and connectivity between habitat patches along with nutritional stress might also make small pika populations more vulnerable to both climatic changes as well as other threats, such as the susceptibility to infectious diseases (Biebach &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Epstein, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Hanski &amp; Gilpin, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>; Harvell et al.,
