<p class="p">Talus‐dwelling 
 <italic class="italic">Ochotona</italic> species usually exhibit prominent hay building activity in the summer to cache food for survival during the winter (Bhattacharyya &amp; Ray,

 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). This food caching helps in lowering the quantity of secondary metabolites during winter consumption (Dearing, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). However, Royle's pikas do not collect or store plants as haypiles, but instead feed on dry leaves of shrub and tree species which have low plant secondary metabolites only during the resource‐limited postmonsoon season. Himalaya experiences a relatively short snow covered period compared to other mountain regions, and food plants (mosses, lichens, dry leaves from trees and shrubs) are available during the postmonsoon and winter, which probably led to the weak hoarding behaviour observed in the Royle's pika. Its premonsoon diet is rich in nitrogen, moisture, low in secondary metabolites and probably more suitable for spring litter. Although, one of the caveats in this study was the inconsistent seasonal sampling across sites, which would have allowed us to explore seasonal differences within the sites more effectively.
