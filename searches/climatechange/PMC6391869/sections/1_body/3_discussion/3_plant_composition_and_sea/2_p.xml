<p class="p">Our study revealed that pikas exhibit dietary flexibility with high genus richness in their premonsoon diet at lower elevation, possibly due to a longer growing period in this habitat. Thick snow cover delays the beginning of the growing period of alpine plants in higher elevation areas (Inouye, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Therefore, plants experience comparatively longer growing periods at lower elevations (Körner, 
 <xref rid="mec14842-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, the lack of precipitation and low temperature during the postmonsoon period leads to the end of the growing period for alpine plants. This may explain why no variation in diet plant richness with elevation was observed during the postmonsoon season. Compared to other Asian pika species such as Northern pika (

 <italic class="italic">Primula</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Anaphalis</italic> spp.). The contribution of forbs in the pika's diet was found to be proportionately higher than its availability in the environment possibly due to the high nutrient value of forbs compared to other vegetation types, such as grasses, shrubs and trees (Bhattacharyya et al.,
