<p class="p">This is the first study of the Royle's pika diet using DNA metabarcoding and successfully revealed feeding preferences in this climate‚Äêsensitive herbivore. We were able to quantify the genus richness in the pika's diet in various habitats and at different elevations. We revealed the high dependency of the pika on C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants and plants endemic to the Himalayan region. We showed that seasonal differences in the diet are associated with elevation and that diet varies at different sites due to differences in topography and climate. A significant amount (&gt; 89%) of the pika's diet consisted of forbs. The genus richness in the diet is strongly predicted by the size of the talus available to the pika for foraging, with large areas resulting in the highest levels of diversity observed in the diet. Crevice depth negatively influences plant diet richness due to increased predation risk. The continued increase in temperature could have a significant effect on the distribution of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants and reduce the amount of plant species available on which the pika can feed, which would be likely to impact both pika numbers and their distribution, especially in lower elevation habitats.
