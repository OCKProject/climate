 <p class="p">Genus 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus</italic> has a wide distribution in North Africa and in the Middle East. In the present study, we modeled the habitat suitability of two Omani species of the genus (
  <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi</italic>) to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on their distribution. Mean diurnal range and precipitation of wettest quarter are the most highly contributed variables for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">dhofarensis</italic>, respectively. The potential distribution for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">dhofarensis</italic> in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic> indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method. Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.
