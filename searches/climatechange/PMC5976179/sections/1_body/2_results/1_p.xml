<p class="p">All models were run in ten replicates for two periods of time (the current time and future time of 2050) and the AUC values of all models were obtained with high accuracy values (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197884.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Based on the AUC values, the maps were predicted as very good level (more than 0.950). According to the result, BIO18 (mean diurnal range) and BIO2 (precipitation of warmest quarter) are the most contributed variables in the current habitat suitability predictions of

 <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic>, respectively. However, the most contributed variables for the future period are BIO17, 4, and 2 in different scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197884.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Suitability of habitat for both species changed from the current period to the future time (Figs

 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis</italic> changed distinctly in the future prediction and was restricted to Oman and some coastal regions in Yemen; the species range in the Horn of Africa was reduced because of unsuitable areas (

 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi</italic> and future projections in different scenarios didn’t show any distribution differences between current and future periods. Southeastern Iran (Makran region) and the Hajar Mountains of Oman are the most favorable areas for the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi</italic>. Based on the niche overlap analysis, habitat suitability among current and future scenarios are overlapped more than 80% based on both Schoener’s
