<p class="p">Species distribution was modeled for different time periods using MaxEnt 3.3.3e [

 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. MaxEnt predicts the current distribution range and projects it to make a future prediction. Twenty-five percent of all data were considered as test data and the rest were used as training data. All setting parameters were left as default (regularization multiplier = 1; max number of background points = 10000) and the analysis was run using ten replicates as cross-validate type. Model accuracy was evaluated using area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), ranging between 0.5 and 1. The AUC of 1 means that the predicted model is very good [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The predicted models were run for the present time and then projected for 2050. All obtained models were evaluated using ENMTools [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] to find the percentage of niche overlap between current and future predicted models and to show the degree of change in suitable regions. For this aim, two values are important as Schoener’s
