 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197884.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). All layers were downloaded in 30 arc-sec resolution and clipped using ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI) for the region of the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent countries. To avoid the effect of high correlation among layers, we examined all 19 layers using Openmodeller 1.0.7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and then used the Pearson correlation method to obtain higher correlative layers (&gt; 0.7). Layers with lower correlation (&lt; 0.7) were selected for the analyses as follows: 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis</italic>: BIO4, BIO6, BIO15, BIO17, BIO18 and BIO19; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic>: BIO2, BIO4, BIO17 and BIO19.
