 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197884.g003" class="xref">3</xref>), mostly affected by precipitation in the wettest quarter and mean diurnal range. Based on Tamar et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], both of these species have been present for more than 5 million years in Arabia, so we can consider them as ancient species. With this long history, it is assumed that they may be present in Yemen and Iran, but, as with some other reptile species, there may be deficient data. 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapleus jensvindumi</italic> has a very limited distribution range and is restricted to Oman and the region around the Al Hajar Mountains [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis</italic> also has a small distribution range in western and southern Oman. Based on the Melnikov and Melnikova (2013) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and Tamar et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], we cannot confirm the presence of this species in Yemen.
