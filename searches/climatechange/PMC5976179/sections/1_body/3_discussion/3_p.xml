 <italic class="italic">dhofarensis</italic>, was described from the Dhofar region in southern Oman [

 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] confirmed its specific status. We modeled the habitat suitability of this species and southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, Socotra Island, and the Horn of Africa were predicted as suitable areas. However, the models predicted that climate change in future and reductions in the amount of precipitation in the wettest quarter would restrict its potential distribution to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197884.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Reductions in suitable regions were evaluated by niche overlap and confirmed that the suitable region for

 <italic class="italic">dhofarensis</italic> could be changed by 15â€“20% (

This contraction of suitable habitat may be affected by change in vegetation type, so it is necessary to manage conservation programs regarding these species in Oman. Our predicted models for both species in the current and future periods indicated that these species can inhabit a wider area than is presently known. Habitat in southern Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and southeastern Iran show the widest suitable range for the presence of both species (Figs

They referred to decreasing amounts of suitable habitats for different species related to changes in precipitation and temperature, representing the two main global challenges faced by these animals. Human activitiesare the main cause for decreasing the suitable habitats in some animals, but most reptiles avoid densely populated regions and therefore their suitable habitats are influenced more by temperature and precipitation. Generally, because of their high dispersal ability, these two species can change their distribution range as climate changes, especially
