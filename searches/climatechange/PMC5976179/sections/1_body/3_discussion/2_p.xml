<p class="p">The potential distribution areas of these species have not been previously predicted using modeling approaches, but we have modeled them using the Maxent approach and 7 bioclimatic layers. Our results indicate that some bioclimatic layers that explain the current distribution pattern of the species may not affect the species distribution for future. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic> has a known distribution in the northern part of Oman along the Al Hajar Mountain [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and the most effective layer is the mean diurnal range of the year. This variable is not influenced by climate change, so we may expect that the distribution range of this species will not change from the present (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197884.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The second effective layer is BIO19 (precipitation of coldest quarter). The most probable value of the precipitation reported is about 100 mm and a value higher than this has a negative effect on the species presence [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Based on the current prediction, this region normally has low precipitation and therefore climate change is not predicted to directly affect suitable habitats in the future. Based on the niche overlap analysis, habitat suitability among current and future different scenarios overlapped more than 80% and confirms that climate change cannot affect the distribution pattern of the species in future (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197884.s004" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). The suitability of habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic> on both sides of Oman Sea can tell us about the species presence in southeastern Iran because the Persian Gulf dried several times during the Pleistocene period [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and several taxa entered into the Iranian Plateau, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudoceramodactylus khobarensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Pristorus rupestris</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. If 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">jensvindumi</italic> was represented in Iran, then this happened recently. However, we donâ€™t have any records of the species in the region and there is a need for more investigation in southeast Iran.
