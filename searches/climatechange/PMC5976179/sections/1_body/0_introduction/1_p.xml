<p class="p">Climate change and increasing human activities are increasingly affecting biodiversity around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Climate change can cause species to change their distribution patterns according to the availability of suitable habitat regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], but may also change distributions by affecting other factors, such as predators and competitors. Therefore, future species distribution is related to a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. Additionally, habitat destruction and the degradation of ecosystems are important factors influencing species migration [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Species with small distribution ranges can be greatly affected by these changes, so it is important to estimate the effects of climate change in developing effective conservation programs for them. Biodiversity has been threatened by climate change and global warming effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] because these are important factors controlling the species expansion and dispersion [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Climate change can affect the amount of food resources for animals and, in addition to increasing temperature, can increase drought conditions [
