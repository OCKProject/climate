<p class="p">The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus</italic> has evolved around the Red Sea and is currently known from Arabia and Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It was known as a monotypic genus (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus sinaitus</italic>) for several years [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], but is now considered a species complex. Recently, morphological examination of different populations of the species showed that it contains at least five or six species within the complex [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Tamar et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] revised the genus using different molecular markers and found that the genus contains different species because the previous studies focused on using only COI sequences. Based on Tamar et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], six species of the genus occurred around the Red Sea and Arabia. Two recently described species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotrapelus</italic> that are distributed in Oman (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dhofarensis</italic>,

 <xref rid="pone.0197884.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] have not been well-studied to understand their ecological features.
