 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows regional welfare changes associated with 3 °C of warming based on the meta-analysis results, normalized by the current value of the four crops being modeled. At this level of warming, total effects on welfare (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>) are negative in most areas, primarily driven by the direct productivity effect of climate change on agriculture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). However, terms-of-trade effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) are important in determining the distribution of global welfare gains across individual regions, comprising &gt;50% of total welfare change in some regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). Because world crop prices are increasing in this scenario (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>), it is the net agricultural exporters that tend to gain from changing terms of trade (e.g., Australia, Argentina, USA), while net importers lose (e.g., Mexico, the Middle East, North Africa). Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref> shows the same welfare decomposition but based on yield changes from the GGCMI ensemble (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref> shows results for the full ensemble, including models that do not represent nitrogen stress). Both sets of results show welfare declines in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and China. However, the GGCMI results show much wider welfare gains from productivity improvement in higher latitudes. In addition, price changes are more variable (with an increase in maize and soy prices but decreases in wheat and rice prices), so that the terms-of-trade effects are smaller and are distributed differently between importers and exporters of different crops. Note that our results differ from Nelson et al
