<p id="Par10" class="p">Our continuous response functions are extrapolated globally using maps of baseline temperature and the spatial pattern of global temperature change in order to estimate yield changes for different levels of global warming (Methods, Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). We compare these results to those from the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI), the one other source of global, multi-crop, multi-model yield changes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>)

 </sup>. Our preferred results focus on the set of models within the AgMIP ensemble that explicitly represent nitrogen stress (see Methods section) though in the SI we also present results using the full ensemble. The two approaches for estimating yield impacts differ substantially in the kinds of spatial heterogeneity in the yield response to warming and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> that are captured. The GGCMI results explicitly account for spatial variation resulting from soil type, irrigation, baseline temperature, and (in models representing nitrogen stress) nutrient limitations. The meta-analysis deliberately smooths out most of this heterogeneity in order to more precisely estimate a common response function, preserving only the heterogeneity resulting from different baseline temperatures. (See also Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for additional discussion on sources of spatial heterogeneity).
