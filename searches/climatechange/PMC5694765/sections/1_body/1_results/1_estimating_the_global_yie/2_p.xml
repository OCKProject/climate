 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from preindustrial levels. This is very close to estimates from experimental field studies for C

 </sup>. The effect of agronomic, on-farm, within-crop adaptations (principally changes in crop variety and planting date (see Methods section)) is small and statistically insignificant. Studies that include agronomic adaptation do, on average, report higher yields than those that do not, but this is almost entirely captured by an adaptation intercept term rather than the interaction with change in temperature. This suggests that changes described as adaptations to climate change in the studies underpinning our meta-analysis would provide similar yield benefits with and without climate change and are therefore not true climate adaptations as conventionally defined

 </sup>. In results that follow we include only the true climate adaptation effect for all crops, but we find this to be small (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that this statement refers only to the on-farm, within-crop agronomic adaptations captured by the studies that support the meta-analysis. Additional economic adaptations such as crop switching, increasing production intensity, substituting consumption, or adjusting trade relationships are captured in the GTAP model (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>).
