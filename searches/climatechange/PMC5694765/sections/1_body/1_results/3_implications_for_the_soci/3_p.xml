<p id="Par16" class="p">We use an IAM damage module based on the FUND model and substitute our new agricultural damage functions into the agricultural sector to calculate how the SCC changes as a result of this more up-to-date science and new economic modeling (see Methods section). Because total damages in FUND are an additive sum over regions and sectors, the SCC can be decomposed into its constituent parts. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> summarizes the results of this analysis, using a 3% discount rate. Additional results based on a 2.5 and 5% discount rate are given in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>. Currently, agriculture in FUND contributes a benefit of $2.7 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> toward the SCC. In contrast, damage functions based on both the preferred AgMIP GGCMI ensemble and the meta-analysis show net costs of $3.5 and $8.5 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively (95% confidence interval based on the spread in yield impacts for the meta-analysis is −$0.6 to $33.3 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). This difference has a substantial effect on the SCC: although the FUND model represents damages from 14 impact sectors, only a few key sectors—agriculture, cooling, and heating—contribute substantively to the SCC
