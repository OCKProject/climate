 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows our damage functions estimated from both the meta-analysis and GGCMI yield responses, compared to the existing agricultural sector damage functions in FUND (see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Agriculture in FUND shows benefits in all regions for warming &lt; 3 °C. This is a result of both a direct positive effect of moderate amounts of warming on yields for all regions and the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. In contrast, our meta-analysis results show almost universal negative welfare changes for warming beyond 2 °C that in many cases are very large. Current FUND welfare impacts are almost entirely at or beyond the upper bound of our 95% confidence intervals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Results for the preferred AgMIP GGCMI ensemble fall in between these two cases. In some regions (Japan+Korea and the Middle East), they closely track existing FUND damages. In other regions (Central America, USA, South Asia), they show welfare declines at 2 and 3° of warming that are similar to our meta-analysis results.
