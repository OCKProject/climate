 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>, we developed global gridded yield change scenarios for the four major crops (maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans). Although IAM damage functions are typically based on global temperature changes, it is important to account for the fact that local warming may differ significantly from global warming in estimating impacts. Local yield impacts will depend on local temperature changes, which scale in a predictable way with global temperature change. We estimate this scaling using the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean for the high emissions scenario RCP 8.5

 </sup>. For each grid cell, we take the change in temperature between a future (2035–2065) and baseline (1861–1900) period and divide by the mean global warming over this time period, giving the pattern scaling relationship between global and local temperature change for each grid cell (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">21</xref>). For a given increase in global mean temperature, warming is larger over land than over the ocean and at high latitudes compared to the tropics.
