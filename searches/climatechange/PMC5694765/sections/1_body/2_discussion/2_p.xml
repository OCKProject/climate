<p id="Par19" class="p">Of the three IAMs used to estimate the SCC, only FUND explicitly represents the agricultural sector, so that has been the focus of comparison in this paper. However, agricultural impacts are a part of damages in the two other models. In PAGE (2009 version) agricultural impacts are represented within the market impacts damage function and in DICE (2013 version) they are in the non-sea level rise damage function
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. Given the same socio-economic assumptions and climate model used to calculate SCC values reported in the previous section, these damage functions give SCC values of $6.6 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and $18.9 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively (3% discount rate)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. In the case of PAGE, market impacts are substantially smaller than agricultural damages estimated using the meta-analysis ($8.5 ton
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), implying either that there are large off-setting benefits in other market sectors or that the empirical basis for the market impacts damage function may need to be reviewed. In the case of DICE, our results imply that agricultural impacts make up between 19% (AgMIP) and 45% (meta-analysis) of non-sea level rise damages.
