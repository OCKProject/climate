<p class="p">The use of crop and cropping system models, and their forcing with numerical weather predictions (NWPs), allows investigation of the performance of crops under different climates and management techniques, providing key evidence about the best adaptation strategies that should be adopted to minimize the impact of climate change on agricultural production. In this respect, Pohankova 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. analyse the use of crop growth models for assessing crop water productivity of barley. Furthermore, the integration of crop models with NWPs is thoroughly investigated by Lalic 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. for winter wheat and summer crops, by Stricevic 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. for maize grown under present and future climate of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by Ventrella 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. for tomato in Southern Italy. Further, the combination of NWPs and VISâ€“NIR satellite images is presented by Chirico 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. as a strategy for long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Southern Italy.
