<p class="p">Nowadays, there is strong evidence of climate change impact on agricultural water use and production. The availability of land and water resources for agricultural use is decreasing, while the demand for food is increasing due to population growth and changes in diets. Therefore, there is a powerful need to strengthen the agricultural water sector with new management strategies, techniques and measures that can improve and stabilize crop water productivity under on-going and future climate limitations. Consequently, the sustainable and efficient management of land and water resources, defined through an interdisciplinary approach, high-level scientific information and the development and application of advanced technological solutions is a primary goal.</p>
