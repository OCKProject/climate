<p class="p">The use of remotely sensed data has become more common to support management, monitoring and controlling activities at different spatial and temporal scales. Papadavid and Toulios give an overview of the use of remote sensing for estimating crop evapotranspiration and yield at regional level, while Thaler 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. describe the advantages of satellite-based soil moisture products as key information for the estimation of cropâ€“soil water balance. On the contrary, the operational use of remote sensing for water management in agriculture, and the impact of related information, should also be considered. This aspect is described in two papers by Altobelli 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. that analyse the use of satellite-based irrigation advisory services, as well as the use of the water footprint as an indicator of sustainability, from a socio-economic perspective.
