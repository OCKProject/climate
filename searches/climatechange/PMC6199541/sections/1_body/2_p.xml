<p class="p">The use of advanced tools and real-time data such as remote sensing, updated climatic databases, seasonal weather forecasting, climatic projections/scenarios, hydrological, crop-growth and soil–water balance models, as well as their integration, represents a key strategy for the sustainability of both irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Accordingly, the set of manuscripts included in this Themed Issue aims to provide an extensive insight into the most recent key tools and agricultural strategies, focusing on the assessment and improvement of crop water productivity under different climatic conditions and at different scales. As is shown clearly, the use of such instruments allows a detailed analysis of interactions between soil–plant–atmosphere continuum and management practices and, therefore, many new and complex scenarios can be taken into account.</p>
