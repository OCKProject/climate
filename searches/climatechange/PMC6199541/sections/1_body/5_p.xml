<p class="p">Finally, the results of field experiments are used as the backbone to develop and improve modelling approaches at different scales and for different purposes. In this context, a set of measured data, information and scientific breakthrough knowledge about the adoption of alternative practices in agriculture is presented by Deelstra for water productivity improvement of rice cultivated in an Indian case study, and by Balestrini 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. using biological and chemical priming agents to improve the crop performances under water stress conditions. Hence, as a whole, this Themed Issue aims to provide evidence that field experiments, crop and agro-ecological system simulation models and observations from remote sensing can be applied advantageously, singularly or combined, in order to improve model parameterization, the knowledge of complex interactions, forecasting capabilities and develop tools suitable to support agronomic and environmental decision-making process under present and future climate change.
