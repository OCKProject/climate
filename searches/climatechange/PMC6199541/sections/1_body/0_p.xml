<p class="p">Climate and agriculture are inherently linked through the agro-ecological zones specifying the best-growing conditions for each crop. The evapotranspirative demand of the atmosphere is a function of the site-specific weather conditions and affects the crop water needs for optimal growth. Moreover, the air temperature determines the duration of the crop growth cycle, which, together with other factors, triggers growth and yield, and causes a chain of successive effects on socio-economic development, food security and trade.</p>
