 <p class="p">We present a coupled modelling and management approach for wildlife that accounts for climate change and can be used to balance trade‐offs among multiple conservation goals. In our example application to polar bears experiencing sea‐ice loss, the goals are to maintain population viability while providing continued opportunities for subsistence harvest. Our approach may be relevant to other species for which near‐term management is focused on human factors that directly influence population dynamics within the broader context of climate‐induced habitat degradation.</p>
