<p class="p">Wildlife management decisions are often based on imprecise and infrequent population data. Although we included simulated population assessments with a single management interval of 10 years, we expect that the upper limits on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> associated with a particular risk tolerance would increase for shorter management intervals, and vice versa. Our simulations demonstrate that the risk associated with harvest is due in large part to uncertain population data, which emphasizes the importance of periodic assessments (e.g. population studies and collection of local and traditional ecological knowledge; Vongraven 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Polar bear management varies across national and regional jurisdictions (Obbard 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and our approach could be extended to include other potential sources of uncertainty, such as incomplete harvest reporting. We referenced the vital rates used in the state‐dependent management framework to a population density at MNPL. For wildlife populations that are harvested near maximum sustainable yield, estimates of unharvested survival from population studies could be used to estimate a value of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> that is close to 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub>. The approach taken here is to infer population density relative to 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> based on knowledge of the removal rate, given that direct estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> are generally not available (Gerrodette &amp; DeMaster 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). For short population studies in variable environments, it may be difficult to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> and therefore necessary to infer a population's capacity for growth using other demographic or ecological indicators (e.g. body condition and recruitment; Rode 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The simulated population assessments could be modified to account for this additional source of uncertainty.
