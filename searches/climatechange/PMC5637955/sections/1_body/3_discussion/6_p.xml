<p class="p">We evaluated harvest relative to management objectives intended to (i) maintain a population above its MNPL relative to current 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>, and (ii) have a limited negative effect on persistence. These objectives avoid the conflicting definitions of ‘sustainable harvest’ used in wildlife management (Sutherland 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) and may reduce confusion that can result when this term is applied to populations that face current or future declines for reasons other than harvest (e.g. climate change). Objective (i) is defined relative to current conditions, which acknowledges that the effects of harvest depend on a potentially changing 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. Because populations produce maximum sustainable yield near MNPL, objective (i) also can allow wildlife managers to maximize long‐term returns while avoiding removal levels that would reduce opportunities for future use. This is important for polar bears because of the value of harvest to humans and because working cooperatively with subsistence hunters is a necessary component of on‐the‐ground management (Laidre 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). More broadly, this objective is consistent with the growing recognition that balancing preservation and human needs is an integral part of conservation science (Kareiva &amp; Marvier 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Objective (ii) directly links management actions to targets for population viability, a common metric in conservation planning. Finally, the objectives and methods presented here require a clear statement of risk tolerance. In practice, our placeholder degree of risk tolerance would be replaced with a value based on statutory requirements, stakeholder values and the costs and benefits of use.
