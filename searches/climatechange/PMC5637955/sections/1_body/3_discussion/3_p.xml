<p class="p">Our findings indicate that a 4·5% harvest rate, with a 2 : 1 male‐to‐female sex ratio in the harvest, is generally reasonable for polar bear subpopulations with medium resilience (e.g.

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>) ≈ 0·15], provided that a state‐dependent management framework is followed and other potential sources of uncertainty are considered. Our findings also support the suggestion by Eberhardt (
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) that polar bears can sustain higher harvest rates under some conditions. This is consistent with observations that polar bear subpopulations harvested at 4·5% generally have not experienced long‐term declines when environmental conditions are productive and stable (Obbard

 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>); and with evidence that brown bears

 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) suggested that harvesting polar bears for maximum sustainable yield, using a 3 : 1 male‐to‐female sex ratio, could lead to a 0·25 proportion of males in the population, and depletion of adult males. We found that such reductions in males are possible at a 2 : 1 male‐to‐female sex ratio due to the effects of imperfect information and time‐lags in management. We used a proportional quasi‐extinction threshold to indirectly reflect the potential for Allee effects in the mating system at reduced densities, and suggest that future work could incorporate a mechanistic model for Allee effects (Molnár, Lewis &amp; Derocher
