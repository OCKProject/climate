<p class="p">Habitat loss can potentially affect populations through both density‐dependent mechanisms (e.g. increased competition for limited resources) and density‐independent mechanisms (e.g. insufficient temporal availability of resources, regardless of competition). We demonstrate the use of remote sensing data to derive a proxy metric for 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> that operates on vital rates through the density‐dependent relationships, and suggest that evaluating harvest using several trends in such a metric (here 0, 1 and 2 times the observed trend) is useful for risk assessment and scenario planning when empirical relationships between habitat and vital rates are lacking. Our model incorporated density‐independent effects by allowing populations to have variable values of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and by including density‐independent variation in the vital rates (e.g. due to weather fluctuations; Stirling &amp; Lunn 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Also, the nonlinear density‐dependent curves resulted in nearly horizontal growth curves for densities (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>) less than 0·5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c), meaning that population responses at low densities were effectively density‐independent. This framework is sufficiently general to include a range of mechanisms by which climate change might affect populations and their response to harvest. For example, if the primary effect of habitat loss is to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>, then the harvest rate necessary to meet management objectives might not change, but the harvest level would decline with declining 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. If the primary effect of habitat loss is to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, then the harvest rate would decline to the point that, if 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> approached 0, a harvest rate of 0 would be necessary to avoid additive mortality and accelerated population declines. We note that if, in reality, multiyear time‐lags exist between declines in 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> and reductions in vital rates, under conditions of rapidly declining 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> it is possible that human‐caused mortality would be more compensatory than in our model, effectively moving populations towards 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> while having a reduced effect on persistence.
