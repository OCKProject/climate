<p class="p">Our model incorporated the effects of sex, age, reproductive status and individual nutritional requirements on population dynamics. The mean ratio of the reproductive value for adult females with yearling cubs compared to 2‐year‐old females was 2·03 (95% CI = 1·83–2·28), illustrating the importance of accounting for the distribution of individuals across life‐history stages (Fig.

 <xref rid="jpe12864-sup-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). We focused on the role of energetics in mediating population regulation because large carnivores are generally regulated by bottom‐up resource limitation (Sinclair

For a particular management objective and level of risk tolerance, we expect that calculated harvest rates would be slightly lower using a model that did not include energetic effects. Future work could evaluate alternative energetic components, the potential influence of social behaviour on population regulation, and other factors that affect population dynamics including migration or genetic effects. In combination, the lower reproductive value of young bears and male bears, the higher energetic requirements of older bears and male bears, and the increased vulnerability of some sex and age classes to human‐caused mortality (Dyck 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) have the potential to result in population sex ratios skewed towards females and equilibrium population sizes greater than what would be expected based on asymptotic population dynamics (e.g. harvest using

A similar phenomenon of higher abundance, relative to a given resource base, has been suggested for female‐skewed populations of ungulates that result from sexual selection, resource partitioning and higher energetic requirements of males (McCullough
