<p class="p">Wildlife managers will face new challenges in the 21st century because the agencies responsible for conservation planning may not have the ability to influence greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. USFWS 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), the primary cause of anthropogenic climate change. Consequently, near‐term management actions will likely focus on secondary factors or threats with the intent of protecting populations until global action leads to a stabilized climate system (Seney 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), or until conservation priorities change. For polar bears, subsistence harvest is important because it has cultural, nutritional and economic value to Native people in the Arctic (e.g. Voorhees 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and because it is a direct and controllable source of mortality. Fifteen polar bear subpopulations currently support a legal subsistence harvest (Laidre 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) through which approximately 735 animals are removed each year (Shadbolt, York &amp; Cooper 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) from a global population of approximately 26 000 (Wiig 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This level of use is not considered a threat to polar bears at the species level (USFWS 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Atwood 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, there have been concerns about harvest for individual subpopulations (Obbard 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), and future interactions between climate change and human‐caused removals (i.e. the combination of subsistence harvest, defence kills and other direct sources of mortality) are less clear. For example, habitat loss could increase vulnerability to overutilization if populations become smaller or less resilient and removal levels are not adjusted accordingly. Habitat loss also could lead to increased human–bear conflicts if longer ice‐free seasons result in more nutritionally stressed polar bears on land (Towns 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The need for a robust, science‐based framework to evaluate the combined effects of climate change and human‐caused removals is emphasized by social and political attention to the harvest of iconic species (e.g. Di Minin, Leader‐Williams &amp; Bradshaw 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
