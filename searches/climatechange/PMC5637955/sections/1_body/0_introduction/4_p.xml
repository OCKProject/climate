The model also includes simulated population assessments, so that management actions can be evaluated in light of imperfect population data and time lags. Next, we develop a state‐dependent (i.e. dependent on current conditions; Lyons

Finally, we demonstrate how to use the demographic and management model to calculate inputs to the state‐dependent management framework, resulting in a harvest that meets user‐specified management objectives with a clear statement of risk tolerance. We also present a sample application of the state‐dependent management framework to simulated polar bear populations under a wide range of conditions including rapidly declining
