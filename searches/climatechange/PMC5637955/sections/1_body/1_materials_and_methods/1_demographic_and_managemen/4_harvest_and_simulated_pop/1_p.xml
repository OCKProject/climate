<p class="p">We used the matrix model to perform population projections (see 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Simulations</xref>) in which harvest was implemented annually at a calculated level (measured in number of animals) that was updated at 10‐year management intervals. To account for selectivity in human‐caused removals and individual variation in reproductive value, the model included stage‐specific harvest vulnerabilities calculated from demographic and harvest data for the SB subpopulation (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-sup-0010" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). This suggested that subadults of both sexes (stages 1–3 and 7–9; Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) were twice as likely to be killed by humans, relative to their stage distribution, compared to adults (stages 4 and 10; Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Harvest levels were calculated using estimates of vital rates and population size derived from simulated population assessments, which included different levels of data precision based on the amount of sampling uncertainty in case studies for polar bears (see Appendix
