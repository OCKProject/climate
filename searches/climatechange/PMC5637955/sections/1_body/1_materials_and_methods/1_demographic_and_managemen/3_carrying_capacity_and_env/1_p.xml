Then, under several scenarios, we projected the proportional change in the number of ice‐covered days, relative to a baseline period, using annual time steps. The resulting dimensionless metric (κ) captured the variance and trend in the duration of the period that polar bears likely have greatest access to their prey. Carrying capacity at year
