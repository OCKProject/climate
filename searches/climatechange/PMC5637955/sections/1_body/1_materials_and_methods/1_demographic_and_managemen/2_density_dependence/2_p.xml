<p class="p">Density dependence in polar bears is influenced by direct and indirect competition for nutritional resources (Derocher &amp; Taylor 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Individual polar bears vary in body size and metabolic demands (Molnár

 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0502" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and thus potentially in their contributions to density effects. We incorporated the hypothesis that sex‐ and age‐specific energetic requirements influence population regulation (Stirling &amp; Øritsland 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>) by calculating metabolic energetic equivalent values from field data for the body mass of polar bears in each stage of the life cycle graph (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-sup-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). We accounted for dietary differences (e.g. due to the ability of males to access larger prey; Thiemann, Iverson &amp; Stirling 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) that could impact competitive interactions. We then represented population density as the sum of metabolic energetic equivalents for individuals in the population (rather than the simple sum of individuals) divided by
