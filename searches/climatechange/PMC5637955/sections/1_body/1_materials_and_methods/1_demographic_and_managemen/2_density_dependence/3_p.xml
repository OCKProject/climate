<p class="p">The density‐dependent relationships underlie key population dynamics. For each set of curves, there is a unique density that produces a combination of vital rates resulting in a realized per capita population growth rate (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) equal to 0. By definition, this corresponds to a location on the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐axis representing the equilibrium population size (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>) at carrying capacity (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>), at which the dimensionless ratio 
 <italic class="italic">N/K </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>1·0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Maximum net productivity level (MNPL) was defined as the population size corresponding to the ratio 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> at which the greatest net annual increment in abundance occurs, as shown on the corresponding yield curve (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). (In this paper, MNPL refers to the preceding scientific definition; it does not refer to the concept defined in US regulations under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 50 CFR 216.3.). The per capita growth rates

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> provide measures of a population's capacity for growth at small population sizes and at MNPL respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). We use 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> as a measure of a population's resilience, defined as its capacity to grow following a reduction to below
