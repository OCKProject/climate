<p class="p">For long‐lived species, the relationships between vital rates and density are decreasing and likely convex (Williams 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Because empirical data on density dependence are lacking for polar bears (Derocher &amp; Taylor 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), we developed plausible density‐dependent curves using a logistic equation that was parameterized based on insights from population theory and evolutionary ecology (sample curves are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a; see Appendix 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-sup-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The relative positions of the inflection points in the curves reflect observations that density effects for large mammals typically appear first in subadult survival, then in breeding rates and juvenile survival, and finally in adult survival (Fowler 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>; Eberhardt 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). For polar bears, adult female survival is the most important determinant of population growth (Eberhardt 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). We based the magnitude of potential density‐related variation in adult female survival (the vital rates σ
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, σ
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and σ
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) on the observed range of survival estimates from case studies. We then set the magnitude of density‐related variation in other vital rates to be inversely proportional to their elasticities, as calculated from the matrix model, relative to the mean elasticity of adult female survival. Elasticity reflects the proportional influence of a vital rate on population growth (Caswell 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Our approach therefore was a quantitative representation of the hypothesis of ‘demographic buffering’, under which the most important vital rates exhibit the least amount of density‐related variation (Pfister 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>).
