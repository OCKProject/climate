 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> is to direct a population towards a target size and to specify risk tolerance with respect to missing that target or achieving some other undesired outcome (e.g. extirpation). Such risks can result from stochasticity, uncertain information about population status and other imperfections in the modelling or management approach. Selection of
