<p class="p">Our sample application of the state‐dependent management framework with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> = 0·75, 
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic> = 2 and a data precision level of 3, resulted in a harvest that met management objectives over a wide range of biological conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Increased risk of extirpation compared to no harvest was greatest for populations with 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> in the range of −0·05–0. Such populations can only decline and any human‐caused mortality would be additive. The increased risk of extirpation associated with harvest was largely due to sampling error: the chance of a positively biased estimate of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> leading to an overestimate of the harvest rate that meets management objectives. Although the combination of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> ≤0 and stable 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> is probably not biologically realistic, it was included to illustrate the potential risks of human‐caused removals under severe density‐independent limitation. For populations with 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MNPL</sub> in the range 0–0·025, values of Δ
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">extirpation</sub> ranged from 4% to 8%, depending on the trend in 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>, consistent with the placeholder degree of risk tolerance. Compared to populations with stable carrying capacity, values of Δ
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">extirpation</sub> were similar for populations that experienced the mean estimated change of −7% per decade in the proxy for 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). This is because harvest was specified using a management objective relative to current 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>, which resulted in equilibrium sizes for harvested populations that declined in parallel to 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> but not at an accelerated rate. To illustrate, across all scenarios in Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> with declining 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>, the median rate of linear decline in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> was indistinguishable for scenarios with and without harvest (mean difference in rate of decline −0·01 bears per year, SD = 1·3 bears per year). Values of Δ
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">extirpation</sub> were moderately higher for populations that experienced a −14% change per decade in 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12864-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). This was largely because 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> declined so rapidly that small‐population dynamics became important towards the end of the 50‐year projection. That is, populations with smaller equilibrium sizes due to harvest were likely to cross the quasi‐extinction threshold sooner, due to stochasticity, compared to un‐harvested populations.
