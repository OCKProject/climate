<p class="p">The physiological processes involved, as much for volume as for sugar content, can be related to a few determinant conditions. Some authors noted that the ideal climatic conditions for sap production are temperatures close to 0°C at night rising above 4°C during the day [

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Climatic conditions in the months preceding sap production can also be determinant [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Precipitation (snow or rain) between October and April (inclusively) are positively correlated to syrup production in the following spring [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Cold winters are also positively correlated to yield because they are associated with increased sugar content in sap [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Warm temperatures in April may abruptly halt production by favouring bud break and the proliferation of microorganisms in the tap [
