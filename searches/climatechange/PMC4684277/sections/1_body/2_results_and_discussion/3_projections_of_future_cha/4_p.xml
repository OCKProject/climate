<p class="p">In our study, the use of a great number of climatic scenarios is useful not only for obtaining a robust estimation of changes in the timing of the maple syrup production season, but also to assess the variability around the average estimates. Although the use of the median result of many climatic simulations is seen as robust [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], there is quite a lot of variation among the 77 simulations for a given region. An example of the detailed results obtained with the logistic model is illustrated on 
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.g005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> for the Valleyfield region (VAL). The density probability curves of each of the date of onset (panel A) or ends (panel B) of production for a given year obtained by each of the 77 individual simulations and for each period of time considered are shown as well as for season lengths (panel C). Overall, our projections for the start, end and length of the production season tend to suggest an increase in variability for the future, as shown by the density probability curves that show an increasing spread (panels B and C for date of end and season lengths) in future projections and also by the increasing standard deviation coefficient in the period 2041–2060 and 2081–2100 as compared to the 1971–2000 period (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, this apparent increase could be simply due to the large number of climate scenarios used (based on multiple climate models, driven with different scenarios of GHG emissions), whereas only one "scenario" will be realized in the future. In fact, total climate projection uncertainty is known to increase into the future as families of GHG emissions (SRES families) diverge and by the fact that the various climate models have different sensitivities to a given amount of GHG forcing [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To investigate the potential for a higher variability in the future, we computed the standard deviation in annual production for each period (n = 20 years each) and simulation. In other words, we compare the variation in the results obtained for each simulation between periods, not among simulations. We could not detect a significant change in variation for the future (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). We thus concluded that the shift to an earlier sap season in the future will not be accompanied by an increase in between year variability in the timing of maple syrup production.
