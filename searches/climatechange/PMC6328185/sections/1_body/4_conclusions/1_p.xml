<p class="p">A new methodology separating instrumental values from end values has been presented, thus enabling elicitation of the true interests of the respondents. Using the new methodology, we found that values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are important to citizens in Höganäs municipality which is in agreement with the straightforward interpretation of the possibility suggested by Adger, O’Brien, and colleagues [

 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. However, locations representing these values are not more often found in areas of high probability of flooding from climate change induced sea level rise according to the flooding model we have used. Also with respect to the preparedness to reduce vulnerability, we find that respondents with value profiles reflecting values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are not less prepared to take measures to adapt than other respondents. We conclude that albeit frequent, values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are not the values most vulnerable to climate change. This in turn indicates a need to further investigate the vulnerability of these values to climate change, using a methodology that clearly distinguishes between instrumental and end values.
