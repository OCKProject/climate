<p class="p">Typically, survey studies are not designed to differentiate between instrumental and end values, which means it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to know what the answers to value questions in surveys actually tell us. In this study, a special kind of questionnaire was used to come to terms with this problem. Each invitee was asked to mark the location (place or area) within Höganäs municipality most important to him or her using an interactive map. Although an individual's second most valuable location might be almost as important to him or her, by inviting many individuals to provide their most important location a systematic sample of important locations is collected. Subsequent on choosing the most important location the respondent was asked questions to elicit what makes the location important to him or her through answers to a series of questions. Following the choice of location, the first question asked the respondent to select the values that contributed the most to making the location important to him or her. The following categories had been made available to choose from: i/ Good place for bathing, ii/ Beauty, iii/ Exercise, iv/ Nature, v/ Historical/Cultural/Social, vi/ Economic, and vii/ Spiritual. To handle the case where a location represents several end values, multiple categories (up to 3) were allowed. For each category of values chosen, the respondent was asked why that category is important. For instance, a respondent who had chosen the category "Beauty" would be asked to select up to three of the following alternative potential motivations: i/ The place itself is beautiful, ii/ The view is beautiful, iii/ The flora is beautiful, iv/ The landforms are beautiful, v/ The buildings are beautiful, vi/ The landscape of which the location is a part is beautiful. By choosing a certain motivation, new questions were triggered unless the chosen motivation had been predefined as an end value. Hence the questions asked made up one or more chains of questions with each chain leading up to an end value (

These had been provided by the authors as expert opinions on which values might be threatened by flooding in the area in question. The respondents were asked to rate the value of each end value chosen on a scale from 1 through 7. The median was used in cases where more than one value was assigned to one end value.
