<p class="p">Each recipient was assigned a code to enable targeted reminders to be sent to those who did not reply. To allow researchers to connect a particular answer to a particular respondent, the file containing responses needed to be cross-tabulated, which has not been done at any time. The research adhered to the Personal Data Act (SFS 1998:204). No further approval by the Regional Ethical Review Board (Etikprövningsnämnden) was necessary, which was confirmed in writing by a representative of the Board. The study is based on personal data for which legal restrictions for accessing the data apply. The data is deposited at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and access to them is regulated by the Public Access to Information and Screcy Act (SFS 2009:400). The research material can be accessed by anyone with a legitimate interest in it. Requests should be addressed to the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences via
