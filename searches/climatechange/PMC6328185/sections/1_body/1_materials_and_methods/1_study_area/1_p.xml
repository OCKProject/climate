<p class="p">The study was conducted in Höganäs municipality located in southern Sweden (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Assuming the local average sea level in year 2100 is +85 cm compared to in 2009, the maximum sea level with a return period of 10 years has been estimated to +237 cm compared to the local average sea level in 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. This estimate is based on extreme value statistics applied to sea level observations made in Viken south of the regional centre Höganäs during the period 1976 to 2013 and taking local land rise into account. The rate of post-glacial land rise is lower in southern Sweden than in other parts of Sweden which makes the coast in Höganäs municipality particularly exposed to sea level rise. A 10 year return period corresponds to a probability of temporary flooding in 65% of the years over a 10 year period. The results were distributed across the terrain by use of a digital elevation model of 2 m resolution (

The low-lying areas close to the village Jonstorp and along the Görslövsån creek are particularly prone to flooding from sea level rise and the cliff coast in the vicinity of Jonstorp is more susceptible to erosion from sea level rise, see for instance [
