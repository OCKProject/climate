<p class="p">There is also a research methodological reason for making the distinction between value as a means to something else and value as an end in itself. Asking respondents about what they value, without making this distinction, leads to a situation where the researchers do not know whether the answer they get represents the degree at which the respondent values the phenomenon itself or whether it represents the degree at which the respondent believes that it is a good way of getting something else that (s)he values. It is therefore important to not just assume that a value answer from a respondent represents what (s)he ultimately values. In order to understand what has value in itself to a respondent, it is thus necessary to ask "why do you value this phenomenon?", and if the respondent answers by pointing at its ability to promote some other phenomenon keep asking until the respondent is no longer prepared to motivate her valuation by pointing at some other phenomenon. In a study that is aimed at understanding values as ultimate motives and not at estimating the more or less educated guesses of the respondents regarding the usefulness of one phenomenon to promote some other phenomenon, it is in fact not meaningful to ask respondents to grade their values until the end value is reached.</p>
