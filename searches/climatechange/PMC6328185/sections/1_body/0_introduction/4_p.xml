<p class="p">A much tried but often unsuccessful way of making values explicit as well as to make them easier to compare, is to dress them in monetary terms. Adger, O’Brien, and colleagues point out that sometimes "[t]he loss of place and its psychosocial and cultural elements (the loss of a 'world') can arguably never be compensated for with money" [

 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], but when translating non-monetary value into monetary value, some information is inevitably lost. The information lost is typically qualitative information relating to specific types of value, see [

 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] for distinctions between different types of value. In connection with climate change adaptation, qualitative information relating to types of value is sometimes important for actual planning purposes. As has been noted in related fields, see for instance [

 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], it is important to know whether a statement that something has value (end value), means that it is the phenomenon as such that has value or whether it is just another way of saying that this phenomenon is a useful means to promote something else that has value (instrumental value).
