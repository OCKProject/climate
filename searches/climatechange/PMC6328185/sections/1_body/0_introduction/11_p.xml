<p class="p">The empirical consequences of the hypotheses were tested by elicitation of citizens' placebased values and risk perceptions from climate change and comparison with a map of climate change induced sea level rise based on an estimate of the future probability of flooding. The approach to valuation applied is based on developments in value theory [

Public participation geographic information system methodology (PPGIS) was used to collect information on the respondents' valuation of the most important location in the municipality, see for instance [

The results were used to correlate with socio-demographic variables to enable estimation of the prevalence and distribution of value profiles and risk perception in the population, and model risk perception using value profiles and socio-demographic variables as predictors. The usefulness of the results was discussed with respect to democratic planning in the face of climate change.
