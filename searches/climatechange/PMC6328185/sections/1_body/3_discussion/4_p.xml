 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], which we deem very important for decisions about climate change adaptation. We have therefore chosen to make use of this distinction in our study while still using Adger, O’Brien’s classification scheme [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] for classifying the resulting value profiles. This means our classifications are comparable though the distinction between means and ends in addition makes it possible for us to know for instance if a chosen beach location is important because it provides opportunity to go swimming or if the location has value in its own right. If the location has instrumental value for swimming and not as end in itself, then perhaps new beaches can be created as the sea level rises that will provide opportunity for swimming. On the other hand, if the beach location is important in its own right, then that end value will be lost when the location is flooded by the sea. Moreover, by repeatedly asking the respondents why their answer is important until an end is reached, a very different answer can result compared to after the first iteration. For example, some respondents in our study reported to have chosen the most important location because of its beauty in the first iteration and not until after several iterations it was revealed that the end value is related to the respondents’ personal economy and not the beauty as such, perhaps from earning a living on tourists visiting the beautiful location (
