<p class="p">Locations representing the value profile "My economy" (MEC) and the value profile "Place valuer" (PLV) are only observed outside of the areas of high probability of climate change induced damage from sea level rise according to the flooding model we have used (dark blue areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) while locations representing "Environment" (ENV) is the value profile that is the most often found in areas of high probability of damage from sea level rise (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Although the value profile "My economy" (MEC) is the value profile most strongly in contrast to values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place, the "Place valuer" (PLV) value profile is clearly related to these values and the value profile "Environment" (ENV) is a mix of material values and values relating to "a sense of place" (
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This means that although the value profiles representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are frequent they are not more often found in locations of high probability of flooding from sea level rise. Hence, we find that the empirical consequence 2 a/ saying that locations representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place have a high probability of being damaged by climate change induced sea level rise could not be corroborated. It appears reasonable, however, to expect the result to depend on the damage trigger. Indeed, Raymond and Brown [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] found that the spatial overlap of elicited place-based citizen values and modelled high probability of damage from climate change differs depending on the damage trigger; bush-fire, land erosion, wave action, or sea-level rise.
