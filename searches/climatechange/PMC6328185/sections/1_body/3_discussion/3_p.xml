<p class="p">Value elicitation is a complicated task, e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. One factor that tends to complicate comparisons is that different authors use different value classifications. The classification used by Adger, O’Brien and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] is based on categories (culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place) that did not exist in any of the classifications developed by Rokeach, Schwartz and others, see [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] for a listing of the latter, that have served as a kind of standard for empirical value studies. The negative effects on comparability have to be weighed against the new knowledge that can be gained through the development of new classifications, however, and different classifications are sometimes necessary for different questions. The standard classifications have turned out to have a great explanatory power, but do not help us in the task at hand. Adger and O’Brien’s classification [
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] is clearly useful for its purpose even though it makes comparisons with older studies more difficult.
