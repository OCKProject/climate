<p class="p">Values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place contribute to all value profiles identified among the respondents except "My economy" (MEC). They represent more than 50% of the chosen locations in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) although the value profiles "My lifestyle" (MLS) and "Environment" (ENV) are different from the other value profiles and include aspects of "personal well-being" and "identity" and "a sense of place", respectively (
