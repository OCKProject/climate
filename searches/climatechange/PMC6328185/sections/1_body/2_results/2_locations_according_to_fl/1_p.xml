Locations representing the value profile "Environment" (ENV) are significantly more often found in areas with high probability of flooding by the sea by the end of the 21st century than locations represented by other value profiles (W = 7993, n = 276, p = 0.0066) and locations representing the value profiles "Place valuer" (PLV) and "My economy" (MEC) combined are statistically significantly less often found in areas with high probability flooding by the sea by the end of the 21st century than locations represented by other value profiles (W = 6176, n = 276, p = 0.00034). Moreover, locations selected by respondents from Jonstorp are statistically significantly more often found in areas of higher probability of damage by climate change induced sea level rise than locations selected by respondents from Höganäs (see
