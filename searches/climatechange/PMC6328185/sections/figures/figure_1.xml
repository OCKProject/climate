  <title class="title">Assessment of the probability of flooding damage and residents' most important location with value profile.</title>
  <p class="p">The flooding map is based on a model simulation until year 2100 [
   <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. By "high probability of being damaged" is meant areas flooded permanently by the end of the 21st century and by "low probability of being damaged" is meant areas flooded at a return period of 10 years by the end of the 21st century. The probability of flooding in the remaining areas is estimated to be lower than that. Value profiles were identified based on data before imputation. Inserted map shows the location of the study area in Sweden.
