PLV = "Place valuer", MLS = "My life style", ENV = "Environment", LCO = "The local community", BEA = "Beauty" and MEC = "My economy". Bars represent 95% confidence bands. By way of example, the heatmap shows loadings on value clusters for the 39 respondents with a "My lifestyle" (MLS) value profile. Numbers 1 to 6 refer to value clusters 1 = "Focus on the local community", 2 = "Aesthetics", 3 = "Personal economy", 4 = "The place as such", 5 = "Active and conscious lifestyle choices", and 6 = "Nature and health" (
