The is no statistically significant difference between respondents having lived in the municipality for more than 23 years (median) or up to 23 years with respect to reporting to have experienced climate change induced storm surge (χ

Respondents having lived in the municipality for more than 23 years (median) statistically significantly more often reported that they have experienced climate change induced coastal erosion than those having lived in the municipality for a period up to the median did (χ
