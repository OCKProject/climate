However, they have been suggested to be not only important to citizens but the values most vulnerable to climate change. Here we test four empirical consequences of the suggestion: (i) at least 50% of the locations citizens' consider to be the most important locations in their municipality are chosen because they represent these values, (ii) locations representing these values have a high probability of being damaged by climate change induced sea level rise, (iii) citizens for which these values are particularly strongly held less strongly believe in the local effects of climate change, and (iv) citizens for which these values are particularly strongly held less strongly believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change. The tests were made using survey data collected in 2014 from 326 citizens owning property in H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s municipality, Sweden, and included values elicited using a new methodology separating instrumental values from end values, and using the former (which strictly speaking should be seen as estimates of usefulness rather than as aims in themselves) as stepping stones to pinpoint the latter, that represent the true interests of the respondents. The results provide the first evidence that, albeit frequent, values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are not the values most vulnerable to climate change. This in turn indicates a need to further investigate the vulnerability of these values to climate change, using a methodology that clearly distinguishes between instrumental and end values.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009527</institution-id><institution>Myndigheten f&#x000f6;r Samh&#x000e4;llsskydd och Beredskap</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7602-5322</contrib-id><name><surname>Blennow</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004472</institution-id><institution>Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M14-0138:1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Persson</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsr&#x000e5;det Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Persson</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Myndigheten f&#x000f6;r Samh&#x000e4;llsskydd och Beredskap, grant 2011-243, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.msb.se/">https://www.msb.se/</ext-link>; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, M14-0138:1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rj.se/">http://www.rj.se/</ext-link>; Svenska Forskningsr&#x000e5;det Formas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.formas.se/">http://www.formas.se/</ext-link>.

However, these latter kinds of value have been suggested not only important for human well-being but potentially the values most vulnerable to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], p. 112 in [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The citizens themselves might take measures to protect values at risk from climate change, should the society fail to protect them. The preparedness to take measures to adapt has been shown to depend on the decision-making agents' perception of risk, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Based on a belief-desire model [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] driving adaptation, recent studies show that the responses to two questions about the individual, on her or his strength of belief in local effects of climate change and in having experienced the effects of climate change, provide an almost complete explanation to adaptation of forest management to the effects of climate change among private forest owners [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. How strongly an individual believes in the local effects of climate change and in having experienced the effects of climate change are thus important determinants of his or her adaptive measures and hence affects his or her vulnerability to climate change as well.</p><p>Also other studies have shown these two factors to be powerful explanatory factors for adaptation to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The strength of belief in local effects of climate change provides an explanation to the variation in Swedish municipality planners' implementation of measures for adaptation to climate change as well [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the case of understanding which values are most at risk, past research has found people who particularly value culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are less likely to perceive themselves at risk of climate change e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A much tried but often unsuccessful way of making values explicit as well as to make them easier to compare, is to dress them in monetary terms. Adger, O&#x02019;Brien, and colleagues point out that sometimes "[t]he loss of place and its psychosocial and cultural elements (the loss of a 'world') can arguably never be compensated for with money" [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], p.15 in [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The problem can to some extent be dealt with through the use of different kinds of contingent valuation schemes, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but when translating non-monetary value into monetary value, some information is inevitably lost. The information lost is typically qualitative information relating to specific types of value, see [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for distinctions between different types of value. In connection with climate change adaptation, qualitative information relating to types of value is sometimes important for actual planning purposes. As has been noted in related fields, see for instance [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it is important to know whether a statement that something has value (end value), means that it is the phenomenon as such that has value or whether it is just another way of saying that this phenomenon is a useful means to promote something else that has value (instrumental value).</p><p>There is also a research methodological reason for making the distinction between value as a means to something else and value as an end in itself. Asking respondents about what they value, without making this distinction, leads to a situation where the researchers do not know whether the answer they get represents the degree at which the respondent values the phenomenon itself or whether it represents the degree at which the respondent believes that it is a good way of getting something else that (s)he values. It is therefore important to not just assume that a value answer from a respondent represents what (s)he ultimately values. In order to understand what has value in itself to a respondent, it is thus necessary to ask "why do you value this phenomenon?", and if the respondent answers by pointing at its ability to promote some other phenomenon keep asking until the respondent is no longer prepared to motivate her valuation by pointing at some other phenomenon. In a study that is aimed at understanding values as ultimate motives and not at estimating the more or less educated guesses of the respondents regarding the usefulness of one phenomenon to promote some other phenomenon, it is in fact not meaningful to ask respondents to grade their values until the end value is reached.</p><p>What does it mean to say that values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are not only important for human well-being but potentially are the values most vulnerable to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]? A straightforward interpretation would be that those values are important to citizens and especially vulnerable to climate change&#x02013;for instance since they are not in focus of the authorities&#x02019; climate adaptation measures and because the citizens themselves have a low capacity to adapt, that is a low capacity "to prepare for and undertake actions to reduce adverse impacts, moderate harm, or exploit beneficial opportunities" [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], p. 556.</p><p>Without making any <italic>a priori</italic> assumptions about the grouping of values with respect to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place, here we test the following two hypotheses:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1/ culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are highly valued by citizens, and 2/ values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are the values most vulnerable to climate change.</p></list-item></list><p>More precisely, we tested the following empirical consequences of the two hypotheses:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1 a/ at least 50% of the locations citizens consider to be the most important locations in their municipality are chosen because they represent values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place,</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 a/ locations representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place have a high probability of being damaged by climate change induced sea level rise, and by assuming that the individual's perception of climate change risk is reflected in his or her strength of belief in local effects of climate change and in having experienced the effects of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus affecting his or her vulnerability to climate change, as auxiliary hypotheses:</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 b/ citizens for which culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are particularly valuable less strongly believe in the local effects of climate change, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 c/ citizens for which culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are particularly valuable less strongly believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change.</p></list-item></list><p>The empirical consequences of the hypotheses were tested by elicitation of citizens' placebased values and risk perceptions from climate change and comparison with a map of climate change induced sea level rise based on an estimate of the future probability of flooding. The approach to valuation applied is based on developments in value theory [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], notably by distinguishing between instrumental and end value. Public participation geographic information system methodology (PPGIS) was used to collect information on the respondents' valuation of the most important location in the municipality, see for instance [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The perception of risk from climate change was elicited from the responses to questions asking the citizens about their beliefs about climate change and its effects, cf. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210426.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results were used to correlate with socio-demographic variables to enable estimation of the prevalence and distribution of value profiles and risk perception in the population, and model risk perception using value profiles and socio-demographic variables as predictors. The usefulness of the results was discussed with respect to democratic planning in the face of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>The study was conducted in H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s municipality located in southern Sweden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Assuming the local average sea level in year 2100 is +85 cm compared to in 2009, the maximum sea level with a return period of 10 years has been estimated to +237 cm compared to the local average sea level in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This estimate is based on extreme value statistics applied to sea level observations made in Viken south of the regional centre H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s during the period 1976 to 2013 and taking local land rise into account. The rate of post-glacial land rise is lower in southern Sweden than in other parts of Sweden which makes the coast in H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s municipality particularly exposed to sea level rise. A 10 year return period corresponds to a probability of temporary flooding in 65% of the years over a 10 year period. The results were distributed across the terrain by use of a digital elevation model of 2 m resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The low-lying areas close to the village Jonstorp and along the G&#x000f6;rsl&#x000f6;vs&#x000e5;n creek are particularly prone to flooding from sea level rise and the cliff coast in the vicinity of Jonstorp is more susceptible to erosion from sea level rise, see for instance [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], than the coast in the vicinity of H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0210426.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0210426.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Assessment of the probability of flooding damage and residents' most important location with value profile.</title><p>The flooding map is based on a model simulation until year 2100 [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

In this study, a special kind of questionnaire was used to come to terms with this problem. Each invitee was asked to mark the location (place or area) within H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s municipality most important to him or her using an interactive map. Although an individual's second most valuable location might be almost as important to him or her, by inviting many individuals to provide their most important location a systematic sample of important locations is collected. Subsequent on choosing the most important location the respondent was asked questions to elicit what makes the location important to him or her through answers to a series of questions. Following the choice of location, the first question asked the respondent to select the values that contributed the most to making the location important to him or her. The following categories had been made available to choose from: i/ Good place for bathing, ii/ Beauty, iii/ Exercise, iv/ Nature, v/ Historical/Cultural/Social, vi/ Economic, and vii/ Spiritual. To handle the case where a location represents several end values, multiple categories (up to 3) were allowed. For each category of values chosen, the respondent was asked why that category is important. For instance, a respondent who had chosen the category "Beauty" would be asked to select up to three of the following alternative potential motivations: i/ The place itself is beautiful, ii/ The view is beautiful, iii/ The flora is beautiful, iv/ The landforms are beautiful, v/ The buildings are beautiful, vi/ The landscape of which the location is a part is beautiful. By choosing a certain motivation, new questions were triggered unless the chosen motivation had been predefined as an end value. Hence the questions asked made up one or more chains of questions with each chain leading up to an end value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In total 57 different potential end values were predefined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s011">S1 Table</xref>). These had been provided by the authors as expert opinions on which values might be threatened by flooding in the area in question. The respondents were asked to rate the value of each end value chosen on a scale from 1 through 7. The median was used in cases where more than one value was assigned to one end value.</p><fig id="pone.0210426.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0210426.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Survey instrument logic for separating instrumental value from end value.</title><p>The survey instrument uses a chain of questions leading from an initial description of why the chosen location is important to the respondent (START), exemplified in the figure using "Beauty", through a chain of instrumental reasons (INSTRUMENTAL VALUE) leading up to one or more end values (END VALUE).

However, they have also been suggested not only important for human well-being but potentially the values most vulnerable to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We tested four empirical consequences (1a, 2a, 2b, and 2c) of the two hypotheses 1/ culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are highly valued by citizens and 2/ values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are the values most vulnerable to climate change. This was done by asking citizens living in H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s municipality, Sweden, questions relating to place-based values and perceptions in relation to climate change induced sea level rise using a new survey instrument and comparing the results to a model estimate of the future probability of flooding [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The survey instrument uses a new questionnaire structure that for the first time makes it possible to separate instrumental values from end values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The importance of separating instrumental values from end values has been advocated e.g. by The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Most of the important locations chosen by the respondents in this study can be characterised as representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g003">Fig 3</xref>) (<xref rid="pone.0210426.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and hence the empirical consequence 1 a/ saying that at least 50% of the locations citizens consider to be the most important locations in their municipality are chosen because they represent values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place was corroborated. Indeed, only the value profile "My economy" (MEC) representing 12% of the respondents is unrelated to these values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g003">Fig 3</xref>) (<xref rid="pone.0210426.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The value profile "The local community" (LCO) is more common among those who have lived in the municipality for a period up to the median (23 years) than among those who have lived in the municipality for a period longer than the median 23 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This is in agreement with the findings of a study on coastal Australian communities even though in that study the valuation scheme used did not separate instrumental values from end values [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Value elicitation is a complicated task, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One factor that tends to complicate comparisons is that different authors use different value classifications. The classification used by Adger, O&#x02019;Brien and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] is based on categories (culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place) that did not exist in any of the classifications developed by Rokeach, Schwartz and others, see [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for a listing of the latter, that have served as a kind of standard for empirical value studies. The negative effects on comparability have to be weighed against the new knowledge that can be gained through the development of new classifications, however, and different classifications are sometimes necessary for different questions. The standard classifications have turned out to have a great explanatory power, but do not help us in the task at hand. Adger and O&#x02019;Brien&#x02019;s classification [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] is clearly useful for its purpose even though it makes comparisons with older studies more difficult.</p><p>One aspect of the classification by Adger and O'Brien [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that is potentially problematic, however, is its inability to distinguish between instrumental value and end value, or means and ends see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which we deem very important for decisions about climate change adaptation. We have therefore chosen to make use of this distinction in our study while still using Adger, O&#x02019;Brien&#x02019;s classification scheme [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] for classifying the resulting value profiles. This means our classifications are comparable though the distinction between means and ends in addition makes it possible for us to know for instance if a chosen beach location is important because it provides opportunity to go swimming or if the location has value in its own right. If the location has instrumental value for swimming and not as end in itself, then perhaps new beaches can be created as the sea level rises that will provide opportunity for swimming. On the other hand, if the beach location is important in its own right, then that end value will be lost when the location is flooded by the sea. Moreover, by repeatedly asking the respondents why their answer is important until an end is reached, a very different answer can result compared to after the first iteration. For example, some respondents in our study reported to have chosen the most important location because of its beauty in the first iteration and not until after several iterations it was revealed that the end value is related to the respondents&#x02019; personal economy and not the beauty as such, perhaps from earning a living on tourists visiting the beautiful location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This makes it difficult to compare the results of this study with value elicitation studies not designed to account for the difference between instrumental values and end values, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Locations representing the value profile "My economy" (MEC) and the value profile "Place valuer" (PLV) are only observed outside of the areas of high probability of climate change induced damage from sea level rise according to the flooding model we have used (dark blue areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>) while locations representing "Environment" (ENV) is the value profile that is the most often found in areas of high probability of damage from sea level rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Although the value profile "My economy" (MEC) is the value profile most strongly in contrast to values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place, the "Place valuer" (PLV) value profile is clearly related to these values and the value profile "Environment" (ENV) is a mix of material values and values relating to "a sense of place" (<xref rid="pone.0210426.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This means that although the value profiles representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are frequent they are not more often found in locations of high probability of flooding from sea level rise. Hence, we find that the empirical consequence 2 a/ saying that locations representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place have a high probability of being damaged by climate change induced sea level rise could not be corroborated. It appears reasonable, however, to expect the result to depend on the damage trigger. Indeed, Raymond and Brown [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that the spatial overlap of elicited place-based citizen values and modelled high probability of damage from climate change differs depending on the damage trigger; bush-fire, land erosion, wave action, or sea-level rise.</p><p>To the extent that 2a is rejected and we accept the auxiliary assumptions it builds on, hypothesis 2 has to be abandoned as an explanation of the phenomenon we study. It is however still possible that locations representing values related to culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are more vulnerable than those locations related to other values if citizens who value locations for the former reasons have lower preparedness to take action to protect these places.</p><p>Positive responses to the questions "Do you think that the climate is changing because of human induced climate change to the extent that it will affect your environment?"

In a recent study conducted in the UK, an approximately similar fraction of respondents as in the present study report that they believe in the local effects of climate change although in that study the climate change effect was specified to be sea level rise [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The risk perception appears, however, largely unrelated to the value profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g005">Fig 5</xref>) although statistically significant correlations between respondents representing these values were found for those who least strongly (value profile PLV) as well as among those who most strongly (value profile ENV) believe in the local effects of climate change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Hence, we find that 2 b/ saying that citizens for which culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are particularly valuable less strongly believe in the local effects of climate change could not be corroborated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Because the experience of climate change effects was found to be unrelated to values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g005">Fig 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s013">S3 Table</xref>) 2 c/ saying that citizens for which culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place are particularly valuable less strongly believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change, respectively, could not be corroborated. In a previous study, no clear correlation between climate change risk perception and value profiles was found [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Both results suggest that cultural cognition thinking, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], have limited explanatory potential.</p><p>By asking people to choose the most important location in their municipality and to motivate the choice provided new and useful information for spatial planning, including planning of climate change adaptation and communication. For instance, basing climate change communications on the protection against local risks has been suggested to improve the effectiveness of communications [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, whether a beach location is important in its own right or as a place to go swimming makes a difference when prioritising and choosing adaptation measures. That values most often are not critical drivers of adaptation decisions makes value elicitation all the more important for climate change adaptation planning that aims at promoting and protecting the citizens&#x000b4; values. Correlation with socio-demographic variables generated additional information even if a higher response rate would have been desirable for assessing the distribution of important locations and prevalence of value profiles in the population in a truly representative way.</p><p>The most important locations chosen by respondents living in Jonstorp are more often threatened by sea level rise than the locations chosen by respondents living in H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s according to the flooding model we have used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Many of the most important locations chosen by the respondents are found in or in the vicinity of H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s and Jonstorp urbanised areas with Jonstorp to a larger extent than H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s being located in low-lying and flooding prone areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Also statistically significantly more respondents from Jonstorp chose the most important locations because of the environmental (ENV) value profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) which was often found in areas of high probability of flooding damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, the vulnerability of the values by respondents living in Jonstorp is potentially reduced because of their higher preparedness to take measures to adapt compared to respondents from H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g005">Fig 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s013">S3 Table</xref>). This is because respondents from Jonstorp more often strongly believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change. In particular, respondents from Jonstorp more often report having experienced climate change induced coastal erosion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). This belief is in agreement with the coastline in the vicinity of Jonstorp being more susceptible to undermining and coastal erosion because of ongoing sea level rise than the coastline in the vicinity of H&#x000f6;gan&#x000e4;s [<xref rid="pone.0210426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, it is noteworthy that citizens who have lived longer in the municipality and presumably have more observational data to rely on significantly less strongly believe in the local effects of climate change and have a weaker strength of belief in having experienced the effects of climate change than the other respondents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210426.g005">Fig 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210426.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A new methodology separating instrumental values from end values has been presented, thus enabling elicitation of the true interests of the respondents.
