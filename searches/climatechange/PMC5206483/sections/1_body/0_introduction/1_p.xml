<p class="p">Reducing the impact of climate change on our planet and reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are major global challenges [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. A strong link exists between climate change and public health, which can be demonstrated by measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, increased use of motorized transport leads to increased GHG emissions, thereby contributing to climate change as well as reducing physical activity levels, which has been linked to the development of many NCDs [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Furthermore, our current food production system is one of the most important contributors to global GHG emissions, where certain dietary changes (eg, eating less meat and fewer calories) can benefit the environment and public health, especially for adult populations in high-income countries [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The unique connection between these 2 issues presents an opportunity to make changes which have co-benefits to health and the environment. Transport and diet are 2 areas in which behavioral change may offer the greatest potential for reducing the impact of both climate change and NCDs [
