<p class="p">Agriculture accounts for approximately 31% of global GHG emissions with most emissions coming from livestock production, including methane from ruminant digestion, nitric oxide from fertilizer use, and carbon dioxide from deforestation/felled vegetation and fossil fuel use [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Livestock production is expected to rise substantially over the coming years to meet rapidly growing demands driven by population growth, economic growth, and urbanization within low and middle income countries, thereby exacerbating the effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition to this, globalization has seen increases in diets characterized by high energy (calories), saturated fat, free sugars, and salt, commonly associated with obesity and the development of many NCDs such as type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and some cancers [

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Not only are these diets detrimental to health, they tend to focus on a narrow range of food crops, which increases the vulnerability of food supply to diseases, pests, and weather extremes that may arise with climate change, thereby also threatening food security [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Therefore, a universal shift away from a globalized diet toward reduced consumption of animal products and energy dense foods not only has the potential to reduce the burden of NCDs [

 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], it has also been predicted to significantly reduce GHG emissions due to a reduction in livestock production and associated emissions as well as increased land availability suitable for growing alternative food or the regrowth of native vegetation [
