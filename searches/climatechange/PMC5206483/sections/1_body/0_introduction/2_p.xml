<p class="p">It is estimated that transport accounts for approximately 22% of the worldâ€™s energy-related carbon emissions due to increased reliance on motorized transport within both developed and developing countries [

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. While motorized transport may be time-efficient in the modern world, it contributes to the problem of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior, which have been identified as major behavioral risk factors contributing to many NCDs and their determinants, causing approximately 3.2 million deaths per year [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization predicts that 7.7% of the total mortality risk within high income countries is attributed to physical inactivity alone, with a further 8.4% associated with being overweight or obese [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, the prevalence of physical inactivity and the associated burden of chronic disease could be lowered with small changes to individual travel behavior, such as reduced vehicle use and increased active travel (ie, walking or cycling) within urban areas [
