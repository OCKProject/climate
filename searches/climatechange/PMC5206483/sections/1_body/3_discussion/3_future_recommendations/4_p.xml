<p class="p">The ability for apps to deliver personalized advice or information “on the go” has been identified as a valued feature among app users [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. However, personal carbon calculators may produce abstract scores, making them difficult to interpret and understand. Furthermore, the inconsistencies in carbon calculator scores and unclear methodology makes them difficult to compare, standardize, and benchmark [

 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Future apps should consider the use of more effective ways to communicate personal emissions data in a way that users will understand. Future work should also include improved visibility and transparency of data sources and development of new metrics and computation methodology that provide insightful and valuable information on people’s personal carbon emissions and potential health co-benefits associated with dietary and physical activity-related behaviors.
