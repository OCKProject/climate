<p class="p">Studies suggest that participants value accuracy in tracked data [
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] but view manual data entry as burdensome and may forget to record smaller travel trips if required to do so [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore future apps should capture data continuously and ubiquitously, with minimal manual participant input. However, thought should be given to the trade-off between data accuracy, using continuous automatic GPS tracking, and the preservation of limited battery energy. App users are very aware of battery power consumption and may delete apps with high battery use, deeming them unnecessary [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Therefore, the inconvenience of frequent battery recharge may outweigh any benefit of using auto-geolocation. Furthermore, care should be taken to protect the user’s privacy by granting control of the tracking feature such as enabling the user to set “sensitive areas” or “sensitive times” [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>].
