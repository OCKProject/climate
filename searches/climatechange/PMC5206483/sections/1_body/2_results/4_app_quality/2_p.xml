<p class="p">Most apps were rated as acceptable quality (score of 2.50-3.49 out of 5) as determined by the MARS overall mean score; however, 1 travel app was rated as poor quality (score of 1.50-2.49 out of 5), and 7 travel apps and 3 dietary apps were rated as good quality (score of 3.50-4.49 out of 5, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2" class="xref">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). On average, travel apps received higher subjective satisfaction scores compared to dietary apps (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=.014, 95% CI 0.13-1.09), and although travel apps tended towards higher overall mean scores (
 <italic class="italic">P=</italic>.08, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.54) and app specific scores (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=.15, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.85) compared to dietary apps, they were not significantly different. Travel apps tended to be more engaging (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=.03, 95% CI 0.06-0.87) and aesthetically pleasing (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=.05, 95% CI −0.003 to 0.88) compared to dietary-based apps, although functionality (
 <italic class="italic">P=</italic>.63, 95% CI −0.51 to 0.31) and information scores (
 <italic class="italic">P=</italic>.15, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.53) were similar between the 2 groups. Free apps were rated slightly higher than paid apps; however, the difference was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=.21, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.92).
