  <p class="p">Habitat suitability map for the current climatic conditions (A), and those predicted for 2050 (B) and 2070 (C). (D) Habitat suitability values in the current climatic conditions, and under those predicted for 2050 and 2070 (R software standard box-plot), measured at the sites where this taxon is currently found. In E, F and G, we show the bioclimatic suitability at the sites where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> occurs at present. In these maps, a color code was used to express the different intervals of habitat suitability. (H) These box-plots show how the Bio 6 variable values evolve (minimum temperature in the coldest month) at the sites where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. The bioclimatic suitability was also measured at each location with gypsum soil indicated by the presence of 
   <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">tridentata</italic>. These values are shown for the current climatic conditions, and under the conditions predicted for 2050 and 2070, in maps I, J and K, respectively. (L) These box-plots are similar to those in (H) for the values of the Bio 14 variable (precipitation in the driest month), also measured at the locations where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found.
