  <p class="p">Habitat suitability map for the current climatic conditions (A), and under those predicted for 2050 (B) and 2070 (C). (D) Habitat suitability values (R software standard box-plot) in the current climatic conditions, and under those predicted for 2050 and 2070 measured at the sites where the taxon is currently found. In E, F and G, we show the bioclimatic suitability values taken at the sites where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. A color code was used to express the different intervals of habitat suitability. (H) These box-plots show the evolution of the Bio 6 variable (minimum temperature in the coldest month) measured at the sites where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. The bioclimatic suitability was also measured at each location for gypsum soils indicated by the presence of 
   <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">tridentata</italic>. These values are shown in maps I, J and K, for the current climatic conditions, and under the conditions predicted for 2050 and 2070, respectively. (L) These box-plots are similar to those in (H) but for the Bio 14 variable (precipitation in the driest month), also measured at the locations where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found.
