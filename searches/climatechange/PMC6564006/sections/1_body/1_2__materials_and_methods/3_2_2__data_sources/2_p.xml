<p class="p">The maps for 2050 and 2070 were modelled under four different climate change scenarios or RCPs, scenarios that describe four possible trajectories for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and atmospheric concentrations between 2000 and 2100. The different output curves reflect different assumptions for a range of variables, including human population size, energy consumption and land use

  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]
 </bold>. The most benign scenario of anthropogenic climate change is RCP 2.6, in which global CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions peak by 2020 and then fall to values around zero by 2080. In addition, the peak atmospheric concentration is delayed by approximately 30 years after the peak emissions. In the RCP 4.5 scenario, peak emissions occur around 2050, declining rapidly over the next 30 years and then stabilizing. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration also increases but it begins to fall after 2070. In RCP 6, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions double by 2060 and they then plummet, although they remain much higher than the current levels. In this scenario, the atmospheric concentrations of this gas still increase, although they do so more slowly towards the end of the century. RCP 8.5 is by far the worst scenario, with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions increasing at a high rate during the first part of the century and while they stabilize by 2100, the concentrations of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are over three times those in 2000
