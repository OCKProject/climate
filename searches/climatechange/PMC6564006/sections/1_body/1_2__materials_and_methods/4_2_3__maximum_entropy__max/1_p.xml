 </bold>). In general terms, this algorithm assesses the environmental suitability probability of a species being present as a function of the environmental variables established. Data regarding the distribution of the species and a series of maps of the relevant environmental variables are used as input, and the program extracts the values of each variable for all the points where the species is present. As such, the distribution obtained is determined by the preferences of the species and this can be extrapolated to the remaining areas of study. These data can also be extrapolated to different territories, or even to different moments in the past or future, although this requires executing climatic models that allow maps to be elaborated with the variables estimated for these specific moments in the past or in the future. The probability distribution that adjusts to the model or the statistics used in MaxEnt satisfy the so-called principle of maximum entropy. As such, it is assumed that the values estimated for the habitat required by the species are obtained through the superposition of the points of presence in the maps of the environmental variables. Therefore, the distribution obtained for the probability of presence does not assume anything else about the distribution a priori from these variables. In other words, this distribution maximizes the value of the Shannon index (a measure of the entropy) given the restriction of the values of known presence
