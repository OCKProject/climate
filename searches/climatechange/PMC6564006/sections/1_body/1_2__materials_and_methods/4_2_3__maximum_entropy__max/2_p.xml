 </bold>. We dealt with autocorrelation issues by eliminating the redundant pixels on the scale of the bioclimatic variables used. We used 70% of the distribution records to train the models and 30% to test them. This study focused on the effect of climatic oscillations and as such, we only used bioclimatic variables to generate the models. Indeed, the strict gypsophillic nature of these plants mean they are only found on gypsum soils.
