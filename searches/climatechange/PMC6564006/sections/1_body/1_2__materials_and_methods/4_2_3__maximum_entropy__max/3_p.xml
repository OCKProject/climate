 </bold>. From the set of environmental variables we eliminated those that are strongly correlated using a clustering algorithm. A dendrogram was obtained that grouped the variables through their degree of correlation, based on a Pearson coefficient. Furthermore, we ran the models with all the variables to perform a jack-knife test on the contribution of the variables to the model to select those with the highest contribution from the dendrogram.
