<p class="p">This study focuses on the gypsum outcrops of the Iberian Peninsula, included in an area close to 623,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> that is located between latitudes 36°00’08"N—43°47’38”N and longitudes 9°29’00"O—3°19’00”E. The gypsum steppes in this territory have a patchy distribution, with a total extension of 32,487 km

 </bold>, and they are concentrated in the eastern half of the Peninsula under the influence of a Mediterranean climate. The gypsum soil habitat is generally structured as plant patches interspersed on an exposed ground matrix, with well-developed biological soil crusts dominated by eukaryotic algae, cyanobacteria, mosses, liverworts, fungi and lichens
