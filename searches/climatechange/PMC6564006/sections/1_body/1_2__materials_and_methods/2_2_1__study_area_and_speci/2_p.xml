 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is a tetraploid, perennial, suffruticose, strict gypsophile with glabrous, flat leaves (the inferior ones 15–50 × 2–8 mm) containing 1 to 3 nerves. The small pale pink flowers are arranged in corymbiform cymes

The seeds are small (1.1–1.5 mm), black and reniform, and they can be released from the capsules by the action of animals or strong winds
