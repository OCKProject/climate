 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> and its parental taxa. Specifically, we used an ordination method to determine the occurrence density along two environmental axes. In this case, we selected the same bioclimatic variables used in the MaxEnt models.The first two axes of this PCA analysis were used to define the environmental space, which is limited by the minimum and maximum environmental values found across the whole study area. We then divided the environmental space into a grid of 100 x 100 cells, each cell corresponding to a specific combination of environmental values. Subsequently, a kernel smoothing method was used to plot the species density on this gridded environmental space. This approach enables us to use an algorithm implemented in R language
