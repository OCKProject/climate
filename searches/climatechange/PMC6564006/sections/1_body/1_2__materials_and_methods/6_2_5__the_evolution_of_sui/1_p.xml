<p class="p">The main goal of this study was to evaluate the possible shift in bioclimatic suitable areas out the gypsum soils, due to climate change. In other words, we set out to determine whether bioclimatic suitability and soil availability will overlap in the future. One way to answer this question is to study the evolution of the bioclimatic suitability values at the sites where 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. We used a Geographical Information System (QuantumGIS 
 <bold class="bold">[
  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]
 </bold>) to generate maps of the sites where 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found, showing its bioclimatic suitability using a color code. These maps can be displayed as a sequence (for the present climatic conditions, and those in 2050 or 2070), indicating whether the bioclimatic conditions change over time and if they improve or worsen. While the information gained in this way is easy to interpret, it is less precise because the values are grouped in intervals. To overcome this limitation, we also generated a sequence of box-plots that depict the changes in bioclimatic suitability over time.
