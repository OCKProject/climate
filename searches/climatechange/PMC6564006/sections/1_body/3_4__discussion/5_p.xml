<p class="p">We also studied the evolution of bioclimatic suitability in all the gypsum outcrops in the Iberian Peninsula. At some of these locations where 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is not currently present, its suitability was enhanced under the different RCP scenarios. It is important to note that this does not mean that 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> could reach those areas in the period of time contemplated, although historically there is strong evidence for migration and episodes of colonization for this and other related

 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> can run at the same pace as the changes in the areas of bioclimatic suitability. If the answer to that question is no, the preservation of this species under climate change may perhaps require conservation strategies, such as managed relocation
