<p class="p">The outputs under the RCP 4.5 scenario differ with respect to those of RCP 2.6, with somewhat higher predicted Bio 6 values and lower predicted Bio 14 values in 2050 and 2070. The trends in bioclimatic suitability are more or less the same, as again the higher Bio 6 values are more likely to increase suitability by producing more benign winters, whilst the lower Bio 14 values seem to be sufficient to satisfy the plantâ€™s needs. The models define more locations with better bioclimatic conditions around the Ebro Valley, opening the possibility of colonization in those areas.</p>
