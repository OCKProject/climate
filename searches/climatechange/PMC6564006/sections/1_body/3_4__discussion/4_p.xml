<p class="p">Under RCP 6.0 there was also a predicted increase in bioclimatic suitability at some of the sites where 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. However, the medians of suitability appear to be lower than those in the RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios The evolution of Bio 6 and Bio 14 in the RCP 6.0 scenario is clearly less favorable for the plant, with less rainfall and higher temperatures affecting bioclimatic suitability at most of its current locations. In semi-arid regions, water availability is a key factor determining vegetation patterns

  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]
 </bold>, an abiotic factor that is particularly important during the dry season. Our results show that 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is sensitive to low levels of water during the driest month of the year (Bio 14), in contrast to the behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic>. Indeed, bioclimatic niche studies show that this plant has a narrow range of tolerance for this bioclimatic variable, requiring values above 0, whilst other closely related taxa are capable of enduring summers with no precipitation at all during the driest month. 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> has a bimodal density distribution with one of its maxima located at summer precipitation (Bio 14) values beyond the range of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> tolerance. In other words, 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> seems to feel at home during dry summers that 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> would not endure. The flowering period for 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> spans from June to September, a period that includes the driest month in the Mediterranean climate of the Iberian Peninsula

 <bold class="bold">[
  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]
 </bold> could be affected by periods of severe drought. The evolution of bioclimatic suitability under the RCP 8.5 scenario and the response curves generated by MaxEnt suggest the presence of an eco-physiological threshold of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> around 10 mm of rainfall for Bio 14. Precipitation levels below this value will most likely seriously affect the bioclimatic suitability of this species.
