<p class="p">Habitat quality and fragmentation are also relevant factors when it comes to extinction risk. In gypsum soils, there are some insightful results concerning habitat quality. This factor, as measured by plant cover and soil nutrient content, affects the responses of

  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]

 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is also endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. Habitat fragmentation is another considerable threat for the conservation of genetic diversity in many plant populations
