<p class="p">Unusual bedrock and special soil areas, like gypsum or serpentine outcrops, are given high priority for biodiversity conservation. From the point of view of biogeography, such habitats can be considered as edaphic archipelagos

 </bold>. In addition, they harbor a large number of endemic taxa and rare species. When considering the conservation of these species and communities, it is crucial to assess possible shifts in the optimum climatic areas and the relationship of these changes to their suitable soils. In this study, we examined the evolution of bioclimatically suitable areas for 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> under four different scenarios of climate change. As for other species adapted to such specialized soils, if the bioclimatic suitability area does not overlap with the location of suitable soils, this species could be committed to extinction. As such, the bioclimatic niche of this plant was also considered, indicating that this plant has a narrower niche when compared to other closely related taxa, which could make it particularly vulnerable to climate changes. If so, this species should receive special attention in conservation programs. Nevertheless, we should stress that a proper assessment of the extinction risk for this species would require further studies and that this was not the goal of the present study.
