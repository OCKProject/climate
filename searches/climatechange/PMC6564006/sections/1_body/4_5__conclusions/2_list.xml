  <p class="p">The output of the four RCPs differ widely and as a result, we have a wide range of potential answers to the questions we set out to address. In most of the climatic change scenarios 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> seems to behave like a hardy survivor more than an early victim. The most optimistic scenario (RCP2.6) is a more or less stable scenario where the potential bioclimatic area still overlaps with the suitable soils in 2050 and 2070. Bioclimatic suitability increases at most of the locations where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is currently found. The most pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5) is that which changes most and while suitability would be predicted to improve by 2050. It then appears to plummet markedly by 2070. Some studies suggest RCP 8.5 is a likely scenario

   </bold> and if this were the case, conservation measures would be needed to preserve this species, perhaps including managed relocation.

  <p class="p">Even under the worst climate change scenario, the approach adopted enables us to locate future bioclimatic refuges for 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic>. This information should be taken into account when designing future conservation plans.

  <p class="p">In several RCP scenarios there are gypsum outcrops where 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is absent but where bioclimatic suitability will be enhanced. Regardless of the evidence of past migration and colonization events for this and closely related taxa, we cannot assess whether this plant will be able to reach these future suitable bioclimatic areas. More information is required concerning seed dispersal dynamics for this taxon and gypsum outcrop connectivity.

  <p class="p">When the trends for bioclimatic suitability under different RCPs were compared and density curves were generated, there appears to be a physiological threshold of around 10 mm of rainfall in the driest month (Bio 14). Again, further studies will be necessary to shed more light on this issue.</p>

  <p class="p">Habitat connectivity is a crucial issue regarding management and conservation strategies, not only for 
   <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
   <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> but also for other soil specialist species and communities.
