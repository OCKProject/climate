<p class="p">It is difficult to assess the risk of extinction in the case of plant species adapted to special soils as their survival depends on the existence of suitable soils within an area of climatic suitability, areas that may shift as a result of climate change. Plant communities on special soils like gypsisols or serpentine soils have two distinctive attributes that make difficult to assess their response to climate change. Not only does their spatial isolation make migration more difficult when these species have to adjust their distribution but also, these are plants that already display traits that are highly adapted to stress tolerance
