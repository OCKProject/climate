<p class="p">In the present study we aim to test if 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> has a narrower climatic niche than its parental taxa, 
 <italic class="italic">Gypsophila struthium</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gypsophila tomentosa</italic> L., making this species more vulnerable to climate changes. We will plot the niche models by means of density plots. In addition, we studied the changes in the bioclimatic suitability area of this species under four different climatic scenarios, each defined according to four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)

 </bold> allow the distribution of species to be predicted under different climatic scenarios. In this way, we could assess if areas of future bioclimatic suitability for this gypsophyte are likely to overlap with suitable soil locations
