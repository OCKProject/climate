<p class="p">Mediterranean plants may be particularly susceptible to global warming because they are currently near their optimum temperature and thus a further increase in temperature would almost certainly affect their growth and survival

 </bold>. Significantly, different projections predict a lower frequency of rainfall in the Mediterranean basin and extreme drought during the summers. Such threats may be even greater for small-range species

 </bold>, and the relationship between range size and extinction risk has been highlighted in a number of studies. For range-restricted species, stochastic events (local catastrophic events, droughts or disease outbreaks, etc.) or enhanced land transformation will affect larger proportions of the total populations, increasing the risk of extinction. For instance, polar and mountain-top species have undergone severe range contractions

  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]
 </bold>, and they are among the first groups in which entire species have become extinct or could face extinction in the short term due to anthropic climate change

 </bold>. Nevertheless, the situation of endemic plant communities on special soils has received little attention to date. For example, ultramafic areas harbor large numbers of endemic species, ecotypes and rare species, and hence, they are considered high priority areas for biodiversity conservation 
 <bold class="bold">[
  <xref rid="pone.0218160.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]
 </bold>. Such consideration may also be given to other plant communities found on special soils, like gypsum, limestone, dolomite and shale
