<p class="p">As a result, it is crucial to assess the magnitude of possible extinction events, as has been attempted through a series of different approaches. The risk of extinction can be assessed by projecting species distributions in the face of future climatic conditions. Indeed, some mid-range predictions of climate-warming for 2050 suggest that 15–37% of species and taxa in the regions sampled will be ‘committed to extinction’

This loss of biodiversity will not be equal in all regions of the world and the Iberian Peninsula, along with the rest of the Southern Mediterranean Basin, may be very vulnerable due to synergies between climate change and other anthropic factors. In fact, it is important to consider land use when performing such studies in order to obtain more accurate projections
