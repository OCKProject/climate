<p class="p">While these changes may be associated with a higher risk of extinction and a loss of biodiversity, biological responses to such changes would be expected. For instance, plants may display changes in species population genetics, altered species richness on a local scale or shifts in ecotone boundaries

 </bold>. The rate of such change is an important concern, and it will be crucial to determine the fate of the species affected and their ecosystems. Most responses to such climate change involve phenotypic plasticity or adaptations in the species’ phenology. Such plasticity may increase environmental tolerance and enhance the ecological spread of a species
