<p class="p">Some strict gypsophile species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula might also be under threat due to the consequences of climate change. Thus, here we set out to assess whether this phenomenon will be likely to drive these species out of their suitable soils, focusing specifically on the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Gypsophila bermejoi</italic> G. LÃ³pez. In addition to previous considerations regarding plants in a Mediterranean climate, this plant might be at a higher risk for two reasons: firstly, it is a strict gypsophyte and, as such, the areas in which these plants can prosper are limited; secondly, this species displays a particularly narrow range of bioclimatic conditions, more so than other endemic Iberian 
 <italic class="italic">Gypsophila</italic> species. Indeed, this is reflected in a recent detailed study comparing the bioclimatic niches of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> and its parental taxa
