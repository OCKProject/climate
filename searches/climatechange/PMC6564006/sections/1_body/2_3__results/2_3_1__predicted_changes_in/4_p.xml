<p class="p">There was a dramatic contrast between the results obtained under scenario RCP 8.5 and those associated with the other scenarios. By 2050, the predicted bioclimatic suitability area seemed to have expanded and moved northwards. By 2070 this area had again diminished, although it remained at a higher latitude. In this case there was a smaller overlap between the bioclimatic suitability and gypsum soils (

In the maps of all the gypsum soil sites, high suitability was evident in many places in 2050 although again, this changed significantly in 2070 when the high bioclimatic suitability values in the northwestern region decreased notably (
