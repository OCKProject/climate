<p class="p">Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, the potential bioclimatic area for 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> was predicted to have expanded by 2050, stabilizing thereafter (

 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> at its current locations seemed to improve noticeably, following a similar trend. In general terms, this scenario enhanced the bioclimatic suitability of this species at its current locations (

 <xref rid="pone.0218160.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We also examined the bioclimatic variables relative to temperature and rainfall (Bio 6 and Bio 14), which usually show an opposite trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218160.g002" class="xref">Fig 2H and 2L</xref>). The variations observed in Bio 6 could be important as the median moved from values below 0 ÂºC to positive temperature values. The rainfall during the driest month (Bio 14) decreased, with a median value slightly above 10 mm in 2050 and 2070. We focused on these particular variables because they are ecologically relevant and easy to interpret. Considering all the sites with gypsum soils in the Iberian Peninsula, this scenario could favor strong bioclimatic suitability for this taxon at some locations where it is currently not found (
