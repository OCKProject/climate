<p class="p">The situation predicted by the RCP 4.5 conditions showed a less intense increase in suitability than under RCP 2.6 (
 <xref rid="pone.0218160.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). While the Bio 6 values were slightly higher, those of Bio 14 were slightly lower for the 2050 and 2070 projections (
 <xref rid="pone.0218160.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Nevertheless, there seemed to be no significative differences between the trends in bioclimatic suitability (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218160.g003" class="xref">3G</xref>). The most remarkable difference is that there were more sites where
