<p class="p">The density curves for specific bioclimatic variables also provide key information concerning the ecological behavior of the species, particularly when two different taxa are plotted in the same graph. Some relevant results were obtained when comparing these curves for 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218160.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), providing data that were relevant to assess the vulnerability of this taxon under a particular scenario of climate change. For instance, the narrower nature of the bioclimatic niche of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> is clear in all cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218160.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), which in conjunction with the very steep slopes of the curves for Bio 13 and Bio 14, could suggest high vulnerability for this species. This means that slight changes in the variables can produce dramatic changes in the occurrence density.
