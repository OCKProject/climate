<p class="p">In the Mediterranean climate, water stress during the summer is a crucial limiting factor for many plants. Our results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> has a different ecological behavior to 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic>, the latter maintaining a relatively high occurrence density even under conditions of virtually no precipitation during summer. This behavior contrasts with that of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic>, where the occurrence density plummeted to 0 below values around 10 mm for the same variable (Bio 14).
