<p class="p">The minimum temperature during the coldest month (Bio 6) also deserves some attention due to the extreme temperatures associated with Mediterranean climates. Again, the range of temperatures was much narrower and interestingly, the maximum occurrence densities for 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> were around 0 ÂºC, below that of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">struthium</italic>. We generally found the behavior of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">bermejoi</italic> to be more similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tomentosa</italic> (see the occurrence density plots in
