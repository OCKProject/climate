<p class="p">Ummenhofer et al. used Agro-IBIS, driven with data from the same six GCMs and two RCP scenarios used here, to simulate maize yield change at a single model grid cell in north-central Iowa between 1951–1980 and 2071–2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Our goal in the present study was to expand the domain from a single model grid cell to the entire state, to add an additional middle 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century time period, and to use an HISTORIC baseline period towards the end of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, 1981–2000. One difference between the present study results and those of Ummenhofer et al. is that while here we find that maize yield is predicted to decline by LATE21 under both RCP4.5 or RCP8.5, with a range of 14–50%, Ummenhofer et al. found a 6% increase in median (from all six models) maize yield under RCP4.5, and a 21% decrease under RCP8.5. In our simulations, only one model predicts yield increases and they occur only for RCP4.5 at MID21 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g004" class="xref">Fig 4a</xref>). Both studies used the same GCMs and RCP scenarios and the same configuration of Agro-IBIS (i.e., a GDD to maturity of 1700), however, they used different observational datasets with which to bias correct the GCM data, they used different domains (one a single grid cell, one the average of 72 grid cells), and most importantly, a different baseline HISTORIC period. The HISTORIC average maize yield in Ummenhofer et al. was ~8 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, while in the present study we simulated ~11 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. If Ummenhofer et al. predicted a small increase in yield under RCP4.5 by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, while we predict mainly decreases for both scenarios and both time periods, then these data suggest that we might have passed a peak in maize yield after which yield will only decline.
