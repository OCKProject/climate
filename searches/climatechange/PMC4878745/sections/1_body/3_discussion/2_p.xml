<p class="p">Our model simulations used the latest climate model output from the CMIP5 suites of models using the updated RCP scenarios to quantify differences in Iowa maize yield projections with and without the response to moisture stress, and our predicted trends in maize yield are comparable to many other studies. The predicted 6% decline in yield per 1°C increase in temperature is close to the 2–5% value found from 1960–2006 for Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], and the 8.3% per 1°C found from 1961–2002 for the globe [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and also nearly equal to the single season decline of 5% per 1°C increase measured 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> at the T-FACE experiment in Illinois [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Schlenker and Roberts regressed 1950–2005 USA county-level crop yields with output from four emissions scenarios and a single global climate model and predicted maize yields to decrease 20–30% by 2020–2049 and 45–80% by 2070–2099 [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Results from our two RCP scenarios are comparable to their results for MID21 but are a bit lower for LATE21. Our predicted yield decline is also less than the 17% decline per 1°C found by Lobell and Asner [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] for 1982–1998, however, one limitation of their analysis, as well as other statistical analyses, is that correlating yield variability with precipitation variability neglects complex soil-plant-water interactions that make precipitation available to plants through soil moisture [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. It is possible that our predicted yield declines are less than some statistical models because soil moisture availability has a slower response time than precipitation and can therefore act to buffer relatively short periods of moisture stress from impacting yields.
