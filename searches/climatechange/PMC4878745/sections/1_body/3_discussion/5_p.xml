<p class="p">Ideally, our simulations would have used a variety of statistical downscaling methods to help constrain our range of predicted yield changes resulting from climate change under two RCP scenarios. Here we used one method—the quantile mapping method—to downscale and bias correct monthly GCM projections across Iowa. While we account for some uncertainty in human decision-making by using two of the four RCP scenarios, there is also unknown error in how the model simulates the response of maize to extreme high temperatures and to the variability in extreme weather. We use a statistical weather generator within the Agro-IBIS model with its default parameter settings (developed using 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century weather data in the USA) in all model simulations to simulate first daily, then hourly variable values rather than using daily data from the GCMs; however, downscaling to monthly rather than daily may not introduce additional error (and may even have less error) [
