 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], however, all of the model simulations in our present study predict that yields will decline by mid-century, and that these declines will continue with business as usual greenhouse gas emissions and without adaptation to the corresponding changes in climate. Therefore, we need to reduce the uncertainty of maize yield predictions, and evaluate adaptation strategies that farmers can use in the coming decades to maintain maize yields. Results from the DEFAULT simulations predict that Iowa can expect a 6% reduction in maize yield for every 1°C increase in growing season temperature. When any occurrence of moisture stress was removed in the NONSTRESS simulations, simulations predict this reduction to drop to 3%. On the one hand, it is encouraging that yield declines might be halved solely through one adaptation strategy: irrigation. On the other hand, this means that even if Iowa maize were to receive all the water it could use, our model simulations still predict a yield decline of 10–20% from present day average yields.
