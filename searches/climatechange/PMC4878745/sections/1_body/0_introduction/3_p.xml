 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, the Midwest USA is predicted to experience 5–20 additional days with temperatures above 35°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. This is important because high temperatures can decrease carbon assimilation rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] as well as grain yields. A study found that at temperatures above 35°C, yields declined by 9% for each 25.4 mm reduction in precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. But even within the range of more typical growing season temperatures, there is a negative relationship between temperature and maize yield. Lobell et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] calculated a 3.1% decrease in average global maize yield as a result of temperature change, and a 0.7% decrease as a result of precipitation trends during 1980–2008. In a global analysis of maize yields for 1961–2002, Lobell and Field [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] found a 8.3% decrease in maize yield for every 1°C increase in temperature, with nearly half the variance explained by changes in minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. Similarly, within a region of the Corn Belt in the USA in which yields were negatively correlated with temperature, Lobell and Asner [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] reported a 17% decrease in maize yield for every 1°C increase in growing season temperature for 1982–1998. The high maize yields associated with cooler summers that they reported have also been corroborated with process-based ecosystem models [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In a field scale manipulative experiment in 2010, maize yields decreased by 14% when in-row heaters increased mean canopy air temperature to 2.64 +/- 0.33°C above ambient [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. While little to no significant correlation between yield and precipitation has been found in the USA, this is not because precipitation is not important to maize yield. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and complex interactions among soil-plant-water processes, regional to global scale analyses of yield and precipitation may not produce significant relationships, and thus smaller scale analyses might be justified to evaluate relationships among yield, temperature, and precipitation. In an analysis of data from 1976–2006 over Wisconsin (a state adjacent to Iowa), Kucharik and Serbin [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] found that maize yield decreased 13% for every 1°C increase in growing season temperature, but that this could be offset by 5–10% with modest (~50 mm) increases in precipitation.
