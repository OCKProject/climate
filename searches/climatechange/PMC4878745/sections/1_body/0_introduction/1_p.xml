<p class="p">Cereal crops, including maize, are the most important food source for human consumption [

 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], with nearly 14 million acres planted in 2012. Other top crops include soybean (9.8 million acres), and hay (1.1 million acres) (

Therefore, the future of maize production in Iowa and surrounding high-producing states is a concern for the global maize economy and future food security. With maize yield variability driven strongly by climate variability, predicting future maize yields relies on understanding how climate change will affect maize growth and development.
