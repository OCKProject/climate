<p class="p">Statistical crop yield models are useful for relating changes in reported yield values to actual climate, and observed yield variability includes variables not typically simulated within models such as pests and disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In addition to these methods, dynamic process-based simulation models are useful for simulating crop response to predicted changes in environmental variables. Previous studies have used these types of models to predict impacts of future climate change on maize yield by driving them with output from global climate models (GCMs; e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]), however, as crop models and GCMs are improved, and scenarios of future global climate and land use are updated, new simulations must be performed to reflect the current state of yield predictability. Here we present results of simulations of the Agro-IBIS model driven with the latest projections of future climate. Agro-IBIS has been evaluated with field scale measurements of water use, crop growth, and phenology [
