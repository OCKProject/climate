<p class="p">Here we report results of a series of Agro-IBIS simulations driven with downscaled CMIP5 output used to predict maize yield in Iowa for the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. We use the Agro-IBIS model to separately evaluate maize response to projected temperature and precipitation changes from two RCPs. We limit our domain to the state of Iowa in order to diminish spatial variability in precipitation patterns and to predict future maize yield in a highly productive region.
