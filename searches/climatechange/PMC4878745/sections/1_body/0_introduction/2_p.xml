<p class="p">The two climate variables most important to maize yield variability are air temperature and precipitation, radiation being the third driver. Across the current maize producing regions, increases in growing season air temperature will shorten the length of time to maturity [

 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Iowa has become a major producer of maize because of its ideal climate and soil environment. Situated in the center of the Midwest USA and Corn Belt region, Iowa has a humid climate with mostly loam and silty clay loam soils, requiring little irrigation (only 171,656 acres were irrigated in Iowa in 2012, compared to 8.3 million acres in neighboring Nebraska [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]); however, periods of drought can negatively affect yields. While drought has occurred in this region as a result of historical climate variability, evidence from climate models suggests that the Midwest USA could see more frequent extreme events, in particular fewer precipitation events with more intense rainfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Like most locations around the globe, average air temperature has been increasing in this region for the past 100 years, and depending on the scenario of global greenhouse gas emissions, average temperature in the Midwest is expected to increase by 3 to 8Â°C between the end of the 20
