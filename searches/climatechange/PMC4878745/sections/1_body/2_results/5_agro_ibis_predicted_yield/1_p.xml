<p class="p">The Yield Loss Index (YLIâ€”see 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0156083.e001" class="xref">Eq 1</xref>) is a quantitative measure of the overall impact of precipitation on predicted yield. If yield were not reduced as a result of moisture stress, YLI would be zero (i.e., Yield
 <sub class="sub">NS</sub> = Yield
 <sub class="sub">D</sub>). This situation would occur with the proper amount and timing of precipitation or irrigation to meet the water needs of maize. Our simulation results show that YLI strengthens (i.e., becomes more negative) under future climate change (
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Note that in the RCP scenarios, both Yield
 <sub class="sub">NS</sub> and Yield
 <sub class="sub">D</sub> respond to predicted changes in temperature and other environmental variables such that the only difference between them is that Yield
 <sub class="sub">NS</sub> does not respond to moisture stress. Only the model runs that have substantial decreases in growing season precipitation, IPSL and MIROC, predict statistically significant differences in YLI, and a third run, GISS, predicts a decrease in YLI only by LATE21 with RCP8.5. In other words, results from four of the six model runs suggest that the predicted losses to Iowa maize yield are primarily a result of higher temperatures, not a predicted increase in moisture stress. The changes in YLI from runs using the IPSL and MIROC data were strongly correlated (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.69) to the change in summer (June to August) precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The regression indicates that for every 10% decrease in summer precipitation, ~7% of yield would be lost as a result of moisture stress.
