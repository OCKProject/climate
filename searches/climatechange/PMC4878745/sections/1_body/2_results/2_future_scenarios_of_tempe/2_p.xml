<p class="p">Under the RCP8.5 scenario for MID21, average May-October air temperature increases in four models by ~3°C, while the lower climate sensitivity of the NOAA model results in a 1.9°C increase and the higher climate sensitivity of the MIROC model results in a 4.4°C increase. Because the radiative forcing continues to increase throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century in RCP8.5, the increase in air temperature has almost doubled by LATE21 compared to MID21 with increases ranging from 3.5°C as predicted by the NOAA model to almost 8°C as predicted by the MIROC model.
