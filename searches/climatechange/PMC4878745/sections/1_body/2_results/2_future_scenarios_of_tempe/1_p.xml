<p class="p">Under both RCP scenarios and for both MID21 and LATE21, all CMIP5 models in our study predict the Iowa average growing season (May-October) temperature to increase compared to HISTORIC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Additional increases in average temperature occur between MID21 and LATE21, and between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with variations among the models as a result of differences in climate sensitivity and model structure. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, four models predict an increase in temperature for MID21 of 2–3°C, while the NOAA model predicts a smaller increase of 0.8°C and the MIROC model predicts a larger increase of 4.6°C. In all models, the additional increase in temperature by LATE21 is less than 1°C because in the RCP4.5 scenario greenhouse gas emissions have stabilized by the late 21
