<p class="p">Predictions of growing season precipitation from the GCMs are more variable than predictions of temperature, therefore we analyze these changes by month between May and October (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). While all models predict either no change or decreases in precipitation in mid-summer, changes during the early and later portions of the season vary with some models predicting more and some predicting less precipitation. The GISS and NCAR models show small to moderate increases and decreases throughout the season (mostly &lt; 20%), while the IPSL and MIROC models show moderate decreases (mainly within 30%), and the CSIRO and NOAA models predict a wetter early season (&gt; 20%) and then drying in mid-season (0â€“20%). One example of the difficulties in predicting yield response to climate variations is shown in the MIROC model results. The greater radiative forcing of RCP8.5 does not result in a greater increase in air temperature in the MIROC output compared with RCP4.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) because during most months of the growing season precipitation is greater in the RCP8.5 runs than in the RCP4.5 runs (
