<p class="p">Agro-IBIS captures the observed increase in yield between 1951 and 2005 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). While the increase in historic yield is attributed to a combination of breeding and management practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], Agro-IBIS implicitly simulates this trend as a result of increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rates. Simulated yields averaged across all grid cells driven by CRU data are overestimated compared with observations between 1970 and 2000, likely a result of the model only responding to nitrogen and moisture stress but to no other stresses that can affect actual crop yields, as well as the fixed GDD required for maturity at a relatively high value. However, given the high spatial variability in yield in both simulations and observations in recent decades, data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> provide evidence that the model captures the inter-annual variability in response to climate variation quite well (R = 0.87) because of the overlap of error bars in 54 of 55 years. Additionally, our analysis of the same observations and model simulation over a single model grid cell in Iowa showed that while the model overestimated yield in high yielding years, the model captured well the low yields (&lt; 5 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) of low yielding years (see Fig 6a in [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]). Simulated yields from the GCM-driven runs are closer to the CRU runs than the observations. The average yield of all six models over the whole run and domain is 6.90 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and the average observed value is 6.75 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>.
