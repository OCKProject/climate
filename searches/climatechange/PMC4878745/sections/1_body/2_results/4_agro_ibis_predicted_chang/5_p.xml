<p class="p">Because we set the number of GDD to maturity to 1700 in all runs, increases in average growing season temperature will accumulate GDD faster and result in earlier maturity and a shortened growing period (defined as the number of days between the planting date and physiological maturity). Model simulations from both RCP scenarios and all GCMs predict a decreased growing period for both future time periods (
