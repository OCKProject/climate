 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> larger than the HISTORIC DEFAULT yield. Removal of moisture stress in these model runs still results in statistically significant predicted decreases in yield from five of the six models in the RCP4.5 scenario and from all six models in the RCP8.5 scenario; however, the decreases are smaller than in the DEFAULT run. For the RCP4.5 scenario, predicted decreases in yield range from ~5% in the NCAR runs to 15% in the MIROC runs. Again, as with the DEFAULT runs, the predicted changes in RCP4.5 do not vary greatly between MID21 and LATE21 because emissions stabilize near mid-century. In contrast, in the RCP8.5 scenario predicted yield decreases are amplified with time and range from 5% in the NCAR runs in MID21 to 22% by LATE21 in the MIROC runs.
