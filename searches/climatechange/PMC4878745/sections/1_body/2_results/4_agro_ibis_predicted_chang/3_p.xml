<p class="p">The predicted decreases in NONSTRESS yield are a combined effect of the change in several environmental factors, among which temperature and solar radiation are usually assumed to be the most important. Runs using output from five of the six GCMs predict a small increase in the net solar radiation in the future for both RCP scenarios (

These small increases, which alone should force increases in yield, suggest that the predicted decreases in NONSTRESS yield can be mostly attributed to increases in air temperature.
