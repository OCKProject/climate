<p class="p">One exception to the NONSTRESS runs mitigating yield loss compared with DEFAULT is the CSIRO model. By LATE21 under RCP8.5, yield declines are similar for CSIRO runs for both NONSTRESS and DEFAULT because increases in early summer rainfall in future runs offset drying in August. In other words, even though the DEFAULT model runs allow moisture stress, increased early summer rainfall did not allow this occur, and thus all yield decreases for this model and scenario are a result of temperature increase.</p>
