<p class="p">Our analysis finds a strong relationship (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.74) between increases in growing season average air temperature and reductions in NONSTRESS yield (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g006" class="xref">Fig 6a</xref>). When only domain averages are analyzed, the correlation becomes even stronger (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.91; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g006" class="xref">Fig 6b</xref>). The regression suggests that for every 1Â°C warming during the growing season, Iowa can expect a 3.0% reduction in non-moisture-stressed maize yield.
