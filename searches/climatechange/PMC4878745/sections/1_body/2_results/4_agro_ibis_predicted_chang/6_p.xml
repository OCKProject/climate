<p class="p">The simulated shortened growing period and earlier maturity generally results in decreased maize yield (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Our analysis shows that for every two days lost to growth, the yield decreases by just under 1%; however, there is great variability in this relationship (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.31), especially later in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century with higher emissions (LATE21 and RCP8.5) as responses to increased temperature other than shortened growing period impact yield. The low scatter about the regression line at small decreases in growing period length implies that a small decrease in growing period (generally RCP4.5 and MID21) can have a robust effect on yield, while with higher emissions (RPC8.5 and LATE21) the corresponding increase in temperature plays an increasing role in affecting photosynthetic capacity. For example, the decreases in growing period length for the CSIRO, GISS, IPSL, and NCAR RCP4.5 runs are all nearly 20 days which translates to a yield decrease of 8%. This value is similar to the NONSTRESS yield declines in 
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> implying that reduction in growing period length dominates the yield change signal. The MIROC RCP8.5 LATE21 runs predict the largest decreases in growing period length of 34 days. A 34-day decrease in growing period is equivalent to a yield decline of 13% according to the regressionâ€”this is less than the 22% yield decline in NONSTRESS MIROC runs, implying that extreme temperatures are reducing photosynthetic capacity by an additional 9% beyond decreased growing period length.
