<p class="p">Differences in predicted yield among model runs can be explained by the combination of changes in temperature and rainfall timing and magnitude. For example, even though GISS and IPSL show similar patterns of warming for each RCP scenario and time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), IPSL runs predict larger yield declines (
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) because of greater decreases in rainfall from May through August (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Similarly, NCAR yield declines are not statistically significant until LATE21 under RCP8.5 because of less warming than four other models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), and less summer drying after some early spring increases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). CSIRO predicted yield declines are similar to the NCAR runs (
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) even though warming is larger in each RCP and time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) because of large increases in spring and early summer rainfall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) that compensate for the large warming. Yield declines predicted by MIROC under RCP4.5 (
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) are larger than any other model because MIROC has greater warming than other models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) and decreases in rainfall in all months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). This extreme warming is also found in MIROC under RCP8.5, however, yield declines are similar to those of IPSL in MID21 and LATE21 (
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) because the May-June MIROC rainfall decreases are not as severe as in IPSL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). One result of the high climate sensitivity of the MIROC model is found in yield predictions for MID21. Yield is predicted to decrease more under RCP4.5 (by 42%) than under RCP8.5 (by 30%; 
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) because May-August rainfall decreases are larger in RCP4.5 than in RCP8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The greater summer rainfall in RCP8.5 mitigates warming as well (as explained above), thereby mitigating yield declines. A linear regression of all grid cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g004" class="xref">Fig 4a</xref>) and of the domain average (average of all 72 grid cells; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156083.g004" class="xref">Fig 4b</xref>) predicts that for every 1Â°C warming during the growing season, Iowa can expect a 6.6% reduction in maize yield.
