In other words, the predicted climate from a particular GCM and RCP scenario does not vary greatly across the state of Iowa. It is because of this homogeneous response that we summarize projections with a state-wide average value of yield in tables and figures, however, simulation results are presented for each model grid cell in some figures and shown across the entire domain for each run and RCP scenario in
