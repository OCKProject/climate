<p class="p">All the simulations started with an accelerated spin-up to allow the soil carbon to reach near-equilibrium conditions. Then the model was run continuously from 1861–2005 with output from GCM HISTORIC runs, and from 2006–2100 for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Because our goal is to evaluate the effects of changes in temperature and precipitation on yield, we did not allow the maize to become nitrogen stressed, we used a fixed, relatively high growing-degree day cultivar (1700 GDD) to quantify how the growing period would be advanced with increasing temperature, and we held atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at 350 ppm. We analyze simulated maize yield and other variables within three 20-year periods: 1981–2000 (referred to as HISTORIC), 2041–2060 (referred to as MID21), and 2081–2100 (referred to as LATE21).</p>
