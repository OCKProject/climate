<p class="p">We performed two experimental simulations for each GCM driving dataset and each RCP scenario (2 experiments x 6 GCM datasets x 2 RCP = 24 output datasets). In the first experiment we ran the model with default settings, which includes the ability to stress vegetation from lack of moisture. In the second experiment the only change we made was to switch off the moisture stress parameter such that moisture was not a variable in the photosynthetic stress function. In Agro-IBIS, moisture stress is a scaling factor that is calculated based on the available water content in the soil and the root profile of the plant, and applied on the maximum Rubisco capacity of photosynthesis. Its value ranges from 0 (maximum stress) to 1 (no stress). We refer to the default setting scenarios as DEFAULT, and to the non-moisture stressed scenarios as NONSTRESS. Because moisture stress is essentially caused by lack of precipitation in our studyâ€™s humid domain, the difference in yield change between DEFAULT and NONSTRESS can be attributed to the change in precipitation only (i.e., not temperature, humidity, or radiation). In other words, while yield responds to the overall climate variation and stresses between the HISTORIC runs and RCP runs in the DEFAULT simulations, yield in the NONSTRESS simulations can be understood as the optimum yield that can be achieved under no moisture stress, possibly from full irrigation if necessary.</p>
