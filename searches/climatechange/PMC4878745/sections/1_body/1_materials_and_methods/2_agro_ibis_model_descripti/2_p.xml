<p class="p">The growth stages of crops including planting, emergence, grain fill, senescence, and harvest are simulated according to accumulated growing degree days (GDD). Planting date is determined as the date when the 10-day average air temperature is higher than 10°C and the 10-day average minimum temperature is higher than 6°C. The number of GDD required to reach maturity is a model parameter that can be fixed or can vary spatially or temporally in response to long-term changes in climate. The fraction of carbon allocated to leaves, stems, and roots changes with each growth stage and decreases to zero after peak leaf area index is reached while allocation to reproductive organs increases to one (i.e., 100%).</p>
