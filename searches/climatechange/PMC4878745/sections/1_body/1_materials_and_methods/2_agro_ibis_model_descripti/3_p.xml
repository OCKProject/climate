<p class="p">Simulated crops respond to changes in temperature either physiologically by changing carbon assimilation rates or phenologically by shifting the timing of the various growth stages as GDD are accumulated more or less rapidly over the growing season. Growing degree days between maize growth stages are summed using the difference between the mean of the daily maximum and minimum air temperature and the base temperature of 8°C. A maximum temperature of 30°C is imposed. Assimilation is also modified by nitrogen and water stress. Nitrogen is applied once at the beginning of the growing season and hourly canopy and soil processes determine water that is available to roots for transpiration. Changes in all of these processes contribute to changes in crop yield by changing the magnitude of assimilation or crop duration.</p>
