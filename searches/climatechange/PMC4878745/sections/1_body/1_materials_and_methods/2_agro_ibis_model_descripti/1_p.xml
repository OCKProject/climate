 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] to simulate land surface processes within natural and managed ecosystems. The model simulates fast response processes such as energy, water, and carbon fluxes in the vegetation canopy and soil, intermediate processes such as leaf growth, and slow response processes like soil carbon storage and turnover. Net primary productivity is simulated at each hourly time step by scaling the net effects of photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration to the canopy. For C4 species such as maize, the model uses a coupled model of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance [

 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Input requirements include solar radiation or cloud cover, air temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and soil texture classification for 11 soil layers from the surface to 2.5 m. In this study we use a weather generator to derive hourly input variables from the monthly GCM inputs, and we use soil texture class provided by the CONUS soil database [
