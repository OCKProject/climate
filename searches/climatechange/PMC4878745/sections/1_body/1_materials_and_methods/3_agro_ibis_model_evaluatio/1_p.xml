<p class="p">Before using Agro-IBIS to predict the yield response to climate change, it is important to ensure that the model is capable of simulating reasonable yield values and capturing the inter-annual variability as crops respond to variations in input climate. Kucharik [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] showed that Agro-IBIS is able to simulate realistic corn yields across a 13-state region that contains our study domain, and that the model captures interannual variability in yield as corn responds to variable climate. Here we focused our evaluation on the state of Iowa and compared our simulated yield with county level reported yield data from 1951–2005 [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. We drove Agro-IBIS with climate data from the six GCMs used in our future scenarios, as well as with CRU data that are based on observations [
 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Agro-IBIS was run in a region encompassing 40.75° to 43.25° N latitude and -96.25° to -90.75° longitude, which covers most of the state of Iowa in the USA, at a 0.5° by 0.5° grid cell resolution. This resolution produces 72 grid cells in our domain. We combined monthly values of the model-required variables from the CRU dataset with daily anomalies of reanalyzed meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR; [

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in 1985 (a nearly linear increase of 3.8 kg ha

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and then continue at this rate for each successive model year. The maize cultivar was fixed at each grid cell to require 1700 GDDs to reach maturity. While actual maize cultivar will vary across our domain and possibly from field to field, we fix GDD at 1700 to use a value that is within the realistic range of values but is high enough to allow analysis of yield changes under a warming climate (i.e., farmers will likely use cultivars with a greater GDD as climate warms in order to maximize yields).
