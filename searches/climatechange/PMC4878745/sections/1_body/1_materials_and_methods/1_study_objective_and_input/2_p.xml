<p class="p">We address one of the uncertainties involved with GCMs, that is, uncertainty from model bias related to model structure and climate sensitivity, by using output from several GCMs. Monthly values of maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation, specific humidity, and cloud cover were downscaled and bias-corrected from their native grids to a 0.5° by 0.5° latitude/longitude grid using quantile mapping to historical climate data for the 1901–2005 period provided by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU; [

 <xref rid="pone.0156083.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and allows comparison of results from this study with those of the previous study while minimizing differences between the studies. We selected these particular GCMs because they simulate historical values of temperature and precipitation that are similar in magnitude and seasonal cycle to values from the historical CRU dataset after downscaling.
