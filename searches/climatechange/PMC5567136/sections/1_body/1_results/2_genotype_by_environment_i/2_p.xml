<p id="Par10" class="p">Multivariate animal models for offspring size at 30, 60 and 90d fit best when family was included as a random effect, and density, egg size, Dam °C and offspring °C (but not the Dam °C × offspring °C term) were included as fixed effects, confirming the results found for the full data set (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). A large and significant proportion of the variation in offspring size was attributable to genetic (family) effects with ΔDICs of −239.4 at 30d, −206.0 at 60d, and −238.9 at 90d when family was included in the models. At all three time points, variance components differed among offspring rearing environments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). At 30d post-hatch, genetic variance (V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub>) and total phenotypic variance (V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub> + V
 <sub class="sub">E</sub> = V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) among families were highest at 21 °C. At 30d, genetic variance was 41.6% higher at 21 °C than in the next-highest treatment (predictably variable). At 60d post-hatch, V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub> and V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> were highest in the stochastic environment, with V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub> 35.1% higher in the stochastic treatment than in the next-highest treatment (21 °C). At 90d, V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub> and V
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> were again highest in the stochastic environment. Genetic variance in the stochastic treatment was 32.7% higher than in the next-highest treatment (predictably variable; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Environmental variance (V
 <sub class="sub">E</sub>) was similar among offspring temperatures at each time point, but decreased over time (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Non-significant genetic correlations between offspring environments (indicating G × E) were detected for almost all environment combinations at some time point. Only the correlation between 17 °C and stochastic offspring environments was significant at 30, 60 and 90d post-hatch (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
