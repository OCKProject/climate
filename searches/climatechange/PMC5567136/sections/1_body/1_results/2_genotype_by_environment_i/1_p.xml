<p id="Par9" class="p">Density (number of offspring individuals in an aquarium) had a significant effect on offspring body size at all three time points (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Densities ranged between 5 and 12, and had a clear effect on offspring growth (smaller size at higher density), but the range of densities in the different offspring environments overlapped (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Also, density × offspring °C interactions were not significant at 30d (F
 <sub class="sub">3,157</sub> = 2.66; p = 0.051), 60d (F
 <sub class="sub">3,156</sub> = 1.13; p = 0.339), or 90d (F
 <sub class="sub">3,156</sub> = 0.46; p = 0.711), indicating that any potential effects of density on offspring body size were similar in all treatments. Note: At 30d, body sizes in the 17 °C offspring environment were less affected by density than in the other temperature treatments, driving the nearly significant density × offspring °C interaction (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). By far, offspring rearing environment had the clearest influence on stickleback body size (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). At all three time points, offspring were larger when reared in the stochastic environment and smaller when reared at 21 °C, whereas body sizes were similar in the 17 °C and predictably variable environments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). At 30d, mean standard lengths (mm ± sd) for each offspring environment (averaged across maternal environments) were: 15.632 ± 1.082, 15.353 ± 1.206, 16.237 ± 1.329, and 16.159 ± 1.121 in the 17 °C, 21 °C, stochastic and predictably variable environments, respectively. At 60d, mean standard lengths were 19.486 ± 1.395, 18.371 ± 1.521, 19.776 ± 1.814, and 19.252 ± 1.665 in the 17 °C, 21 °C, stochastic and predictably variable environments, respectively. At 90d, mean standard lengths were 21.527 ± 1.874, 20.152 ± 1.890, 21.366 ± 2.158, and 21.297 ± 2.032 in the 17 °C, 21 °C, stochastic and predictably variable environments, respectively. Maternal acclimation environment (Dam °C) did not have a significant overall effect on offspring size, nor did the interaction between maternal and offspring temperatures (TGP). Rather, G × E interactions (family × offspring °C) strongly influenced offspring size at all three time points (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Log-likelihoods of models with and without the family × offspring interaction term, respectively, were −1750.9 vs. −1808.1 at 30d, −1961.5 vs. −1987.8 at 60d, and −2091.4 vs. −2130.8 at 90d post-hatch, reflecting highly significant effects of G × E interactions on offspring size.
