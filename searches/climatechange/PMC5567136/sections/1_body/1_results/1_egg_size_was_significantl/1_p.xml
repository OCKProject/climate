<p id="Par7" class="p">Maternal acclimation environment, female size, and clutch size significantly influenced mean egg size (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Mothers acclimated to 21 °C produced smaller eggs (mean egg diameter (mm) ± sd: 1.545 ± 0.070) than mothers acclimated to 17 °C (1.593 ± 0.080), stochastic (1.570 ± 0.081), and predictably variable environments (1.563 ± 0.068; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). To determine if egg size differences among treatments were driven by maternal acclimation environment and not female size, a second generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was run using egg size residuals (egg size corrected for female size) as the response variable, which showed that significant factors in the full model remained significant when accounting for female size (significant clutch size: F
 <sub class="sub">1,64</sub> = 7.21; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.009 and maternal environment effects: Dam °C F
 <sub class="sub">3,64</sub> = 3.44; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.022). Importantly, female size also did not differ significantly among acclimation treatments (F
 <sub class="sub">3,64</sub> = 0.66; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.581). In a full GLMM, clutch size was significantly influenced by female size and egg size, but not by maternal environment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Residual clutch size (clutch size corrected for female size) showed the same pattern, with a significant effect of egg size (F
 <sub class="sub">1,64</sub> = 6.90; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.011), but not maternal environment (F
 <sub class="sub">3,64</sub> = 0.16; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.924). Overall, there was a negative relationship between mean egg size and clutch size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), but no significant difference among maternal environment slopes (clutch size/egg size × Dam °C p &gt; 0.05; Table
