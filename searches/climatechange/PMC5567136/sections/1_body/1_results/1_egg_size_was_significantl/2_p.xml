<p id="Par8" class="p">Within-female egg size variability (CV of egg size) was not significantly influenced by female size, clutch size, or maternal environment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Within-female CVs of egg size were highest in the predictably variable environment (mean 0.0385 vs. 0.0365 in stochastic, 0.0362 at 17 °C, and 0.0338 at 21 °C), but error distributions overlapped with other treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). A 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> power analysis using the ‘pwr’ package in R showed that Cohen’s 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> effect sizes were 0.398, 0.048 and 0.314 (calculated using the mean and standard deviation of egg size CV for pairwise contrasts treating 17 °C as the control e.g. 17 °C–21 °C; 17 °C – stochastic; 17 °C – predictably variable, respectively). Effect sizes of this magnitude (0.3) are considered moderate

 </sup>. Similarly, estimating effect size as 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> using all group means (variance explained in an ANOVA) revealed a medium effect size of 0.074. Based on a Cohen’s 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> effect size of 0.3 and an ANOVA approach power estimation, a sample size of n = 32 females per acclimation environment would have been needed to reach a power level above 0.8

 </sup>. Here, the number of females in each environment ranged between n = 15 and n = 19. In general, however, females in the predictably variable environment produced a broader range of egg sizes within a clutch than females in the constant and stochastic environments, which tended to produce clutches composed of either small or large eggs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Also, among-female CV of egg size was lowest for predictably variable environment mothers, followed by 21 °C, 17 °C and stochastic environment mothers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). That is, individual females in the predictably variable environment produced clutches with a broader range of egg sizes and more similar clutches to one another than females in the other treatments (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), leading to the highest within-female and lowest among female variation of egg size in the predictably variable environment. Specifically, within-female egg size variability differed significantly from among-female variability in the predictably variable (

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test: 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.93;

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.487) and stochastic environments (
