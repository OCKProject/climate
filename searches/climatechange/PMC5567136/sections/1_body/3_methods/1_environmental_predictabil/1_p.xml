<p id="Par22" class="p">Sea surface temperatures (SST) and predictability of SST that this population of stickleback experience in the wild were previously characterised using data obtained from the Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas data web portal (www.cosyna.de). Temperatures off the west coast of Sylt, Germany (54°79′N, 8°27′E), where the studied population originates, range from approximately 13 °C to 20 °C during the reproductive season (May through August), with a mean summer average around 17 °C and an estimated predictability of 6 to 9 days

 </sup>. The hatching time for eggs from this population ranges from 5 to 7 days depending strongly on water temperature. A SST predictability of 6 to 9 days implies that the thermal environment mothers experience at spawning is a good predictor of the conditions hatched fry will experience in very early life

 </sup>. In the current study, four SST regimes were simulated: 1) 17 °C constant, reflecting average summer conditions, 2) 21 °C constant, reflecting a predicted mean increase of 4 °C under climate warming

 </sup>, 3) predictably variable (Var), simulated by changing between 17 °C and 21 °C every 7 days, and 4) stochastically variable (Stoch), simulated by assigning temperatures encompassing the natural range occurring between May and August (between 14 °C and 23 °C) and duration of temperature (between 1 to 7 days) using a random number generator. Water temperature treatments were regulated in each of four header tanks using aquarium heaters, and temperatures were recorded hourly during the experiment using HOBO Pendant® Temperature/Light Data Loggers (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, USA). Average temperatures over the course of the experiment in the four experimental treatments were 17.83 °C (17 °C), 22.09 °C (21 °C), 19.51 °C (Var), and 19.35 °C (Stoch), indicating that the predictably variable and stochastic treatments had similar mean temperatures and differed only in their variability pattern (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Cumulative degree-days in the four experimental treatments were 2976.52 (17 °C), 3688.31 (21 °C), 3257.89 (Var), and 3232.34 (Stoch), again reflecting similar overall thermal conditions in the two fluctuating temperature environments.
