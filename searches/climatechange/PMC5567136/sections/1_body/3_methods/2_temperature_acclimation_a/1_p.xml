<p id="Par23" class="p">All experimental protocols were approved by the German Animal Welfare Standards Agency (Schleswig-Holstein Ministerium für Energiewende, Landwirtschaft, Umwelt und ländliche Räume (Tierschutz), permit no. V312–72241.123–16), and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Wild adult marine sticklebacks were caught by trawling off the coast of Sylt, Germany on 11 February 2015 and brought back to the laboratory. As SST was approximately 5 °C at that time, fish were held in groups of approximately 20 in 25 L aquaria at 5 °C for the first few days, and water temperature was gradually raised to 15 °C over the course of four weeks. On 12 March 2015, approximately 50 fish were randomly assigned to each of the four temperature treatments, with 12–13 fish per 25 L aquaria (4 replicate aquaria per treatment). The light regime was set to 10 L:14D, and was adjusted weekly according to ambient photoperiod conditions throughout the experiment. Adult fish were fed daily with chironomid larvae

Starting 20 April 2015, full sibling families were produced by artificial fertilisation within each of the four treatments over the course of two weeks. Crosses were made using established protocols from previous studies

 </sup>. Briefly, standard length (±mm) was used as the measure of female size, and eggs were removed by gently squeezing the abdomen until eggs were released (strip spawning). Males were sacrificed in an excess of MS222, the testes were dissected out, crushed in isotonic non-activating medium

 </sup>, and the solution was applied to eggs. Fertilised egg clutches were left for 30 min. before dividing them into four equally sized split-clutches and assigning these to the four temperature treatments. In total, 69 families were produced with n = 21, 19, 16 and 13 families in the 17 °C, 21 °C, Var, and Stoch treatments, respectively. Note: not all adult females in each treatment environment became gravid during the acclimation phase, leading to an uneven number of families produced in the different treatments.
