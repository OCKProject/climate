<p id="Par26" class="p">Offspring body size at the three time points (30, 60 and 90 d post-hatch) was analysed in two ways. First, the influence of TGP and G × E interactions on body size across offspring temperatures was analysed. Second, body size variance components within- and genetic correlations between-offspring temperatures were determined. In the first analysis, GLMMs were run using 
 <italic class="italic">lmer</italic> within the package ‘lme4’ due to the nature of the random effects, the nested structure of the family and parental acclimation environment term, and the mixed effect interaction terms. Parental temperature (hereafter referred to as Dam °C as both parents experienced the same environment), offspring temperature, egg size and density were modelled as fixed effects. An overall effect of TGP on offspring body size would be indicated by a significant Dam °C × offspring °C interaction. Family (nested within Dam °C) and the family (Dam °C) by offspring environment interaction (G × E) were modelled as random effects. Significance of the G × E interaction term was determined by model testing using likelihood ratio tests between the full and reduced model implemented in 
 <italic class="italic">lmer</italic>. Note: a direct test of genetic variation for TGP (Family × Dam °C × Offspring °C) was not possible due to unavoidable constraints of the nested experimental design e.g. different females in each maternal acclimation environment. For graphical display, residual offspring body size (standard length corrected for density) at 30, 60 and 90 d post-hatch are shown as (1) the mean (±SE) of all families per treatment combination, and (2) family-level reaction norms within each maternal environment.
