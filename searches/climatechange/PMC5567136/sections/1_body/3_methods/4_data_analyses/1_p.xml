 </sup>. Generalised linear mixed effect models (GLMMs) were used to quantify the influence of maternal acclimation environment on egg size, clutch size, and the coefficient of variation (CV) of egg size using 
 <italic class="italic">lme</italic> within the ‘nlme’ package. Egg size, clutch size and the CV of egg size were modelled as Gaussian response variables with maternal environment (four temperature treatments) as fixed effects, female size and clutch size (or egg size) as covariates, and female identity (individual) as a random effect. The CV of egg size was estimated in two ways: within-female variability (egg size CV for each female within a treatment, and then the mean of this in each treatment) and among-female variability (CV of mean egg size across all females in each treatment; see also ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>). Note: only within-female egg size variability was modelled using GLMM, as there was only one value per treatment for among-female variability. 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>- tests were used to determine significant differences between within- and among-female variability in each treatment.
