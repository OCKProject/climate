<p id="Par24" class="p">Egg size and clutch size were measured using photographs taken under a dissecting microscope and imaging analysis software (LEICA QWIN, Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Mean egg size in each family was estimated using the diameter (±0.01 mm) of 10 eggs per split-clutch (n = 40 eggs in total). Clutch size was estimated as the total number of eggs per female (four split-clutches combined). Split clutches were each placed individually in1 L glass beakers containing filtered seawater and an air stone. Beakers were held in water baths heated by header tanks set to one of the four experimental temperature treatments. At 14 d post-hatch, the number of hatchlings in each beaker was reduced to ten. Note: split clutches with max. 12 offspring were not reduced to ten. Water was changed in the beakers every week. At 30 d post-hatch, up to 10 offspring per split-clutch were photographed under a dissecting microscope, and imaging analysis software (LEICA QWIN) was used to measure body size (standard length ± 0.01mm). At this point, the up to10 offspring were transferred to a 2 L aquarium connected to a flow-through seawater supply set at one of the four temperature treatments. Standard length was again measured on the 10 offspring per split-family using digital photographs at 60 d and 90 d post-hatch. Throughout the experiment, juvenile fish were fed daily with live
