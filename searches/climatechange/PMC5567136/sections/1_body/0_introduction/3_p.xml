<p id="Par4" class="p">In many taxa, size is a strong determinant of fitness and can respond rapidly to environmental change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>. Theoretical models of optimal offspring size predict that a single optimal size will be favoured in constant environments, and if the size-fitness relationship changes across different constant environments, different sizes may be selected for in each environment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, there are numerous examples of mothers shifting the phenotypes of their offspring via adaptive plasticity to match local conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. The size of individual offspring will also often trade-off with the number of offspring that can be produced
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. When environmental conditions are good, some models predict that mothers should maximise fecundity by producing many, small offspring, whereas in adverse environmental conditions they should produce fewer, large offspring of presumably higher quality
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. However, bigger is not always better in bad environments
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>, for example, if large size is associated with higher physiological demands in stressful conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. In unpredictable environments, models predict that mothers could hedge their bets for offspring size via two different strategies: diversified bet hedging
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup> or conservative bet hedging
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, the type of environmental predictability can also influence offspring size. Periodic fluctuations, like seasonality or tidal cycles, with regularity in the timing and magnitude of changes around the average environmental state may have very different effects on offspring size than environmental noise (or environmental colour), whereby predictability is determined by the degree to which the environment is similar between successive time points (autocorrelation)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. In predictably varying environments, predictability is about the mean environmental state, whereas in noisy or stochastically varying environments, predictability is about how long an environmental state persists
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, Jensenâ€™s inequality for nonlinear functions predicts that organism responses to fluctuating environments will not be symmetrical, with stronger effects due to increased compared with decreased temperatures
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, although the opposite pattern has also been found
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, how long the environmental state persists above versus below the seasonal mean will also play a role in determining offspring size
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup>. Few empirical studies to date have simultaneously investigated different types of predictability on offspring size variation (but see refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>); hence, current offspring size theory is lacking an integrative understanding of the influence of environmental predictability
