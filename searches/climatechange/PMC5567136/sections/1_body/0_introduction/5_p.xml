<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, the prediction was that the mean and variance of offspring phenotypes should differ depending on the mean, variance and predictability of the thermal environment. Specifically, mothers acclimated in constant environments should produce offspring of a mean optimal size to match local thermal conditions (as in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>), and TGP in offspring size should be favoured since mothers can predict their offspring’s thermal environment. In fluctuating environments that change with predictable variability (weekly change between two temperatures), mothers should produce a range of offspring sizes (as in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>) that include the optimal size for both temperatures, leading to a higher variance in offspring size and a mean size that is intermediate between the two. For mothers acclimated to stochastically varying temperature environments, the variance among offspring phenotypes is also predicted to be large, but no
