<p id="Par3" class="p">Persistence in the face of rapidly changing marine environments requires that populations harbour sufficient standing genetic variation (the raw material for evolutionary change)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Phenotypic plasticity can occur both within a generation (genotype by environment or G × E interaction) and across generations (transgenerational plasticity or TGP)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. TGP might be especially relevant under global change because it is a phenotypic response that can buffer populations against immediate impacts of changing environments and is inherited across generations, potentially buying time for genetic adaptation to catch up in the longer term
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. Importantly, recent studies show that within-generation plasticity (WGP) can be altered by the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations (i.e. TGP)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, and that TGP can be modified or overridden by WGP
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. In other words, the two forms of plasticity are not necessarily independent processes. Transgenerational plasticity may be selected for when environmental heterogeneity across generations is low, and parents can predict the environment their offspring will experience. Here, parents should produce offspring with a mean phenotype optimised for the predicted future environment

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. When future environmental conditions are unpredictable, and the potential for mismatch between parent and offspring environments is high, the evolution of bet hedging is expected. For example, parents may produce a range of offspring phenotypes with at least some having the optimal phenotype (diversified bet hedging) or larger than average offspring of presumably higher quality to withstand poor conditions (conservative bet hedging or playing it safe)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. Until recently, empirical evidence for bet hedging was scarce
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>; support for it as an adaptive strategy is starting to accumulate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>–

 </sup>. Within-generation plasticity is also selected for in heterogeneous environments, but when environmental cues reflect the current state of the environment where selection acts on the phenotype
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. From a within-generation perspective, environmental fluctuations may also generate optimal phenotypes and reaction norms that differ from those produced under constant conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> due to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and performance
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>, and to changes in the genetic and phenotypic variance available for selection to act on in constant versus fluctuating environments
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. Since evolutionary potential is influenced by all of the above (standing genetic variation, parental effects including TGP and bet hedging, as well as G × E interactions), an understanding of their interplay will be necessary to quantify the total adaptive potential of populations under directional climate warming and/or increasing climate variability.
