<p id="Par13" class="p">Females in the predictably variable environment produced a broad range of egg sizes within a clutch that encompassed the optimal egg size at both 17 °C and 21 °C, whereas females in the constant and stochastic environments tended to produce clutches composed of either small or large eggs. There was variation among females within each acclimation environment, but females in the predictably variable environment tended to respond to their environment in the same way (lowest among-female variation), whereas females in the other treatments did not (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). In unpredictable environments, within-female variability is expected to be higher than among-female variability, and such a pattern may indicate a diversified bet hedging strategy by females

 </sup>. The variability in egg size shown here fits well to this for the predictably variable environment but not the stochastic environment. In the predictably variable environment, mothers experienced the same temperature for a week, which is within the predictability range (6 to 9 days) experienced in the wild

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. Since the time necessary for the final stages of egg maturation likely spanned more than one week
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup>, females in this environment may have hedged their bets by producing a range of egg sizes, thereby spreading the risk of incorrectly predicting future environmental conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. The temperature conditions that hatched fry actually experience, however, are likely to be more complex. For instance, hatchlings from a mother exposed to elevated temperatures just prior to egg laying will experience ambient temperatures, but only for a day or two (depending on the time to hatching) during early development when yolk reserves are still present. After these initial days, the environment in which fry begin to feed exogenously will have switched back to match the maternal environment. The stochastic environment, however, was likely too unpredictable, in that the duration of any one temperature was rarely longer than a few days, and females essentially had no reliable environmental cue on which to base their egg allocation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. As mean egg size was second largest in the stochastic environment, mothers may have used a conservative bet hedging strategy to produce primarily large offspring of high quality to withstand adverse conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. Alternatively, the selective environment for mothers in the stochastic environment may have been more similar to actual conditions experienced in the wild for this population e.g. abrupt changes in temperature direction at various time points

 </sup>, thus, results may reflect past selection on reproductive output

 </sup>. Within-female variability of egg size was also higher than among-female variability for females acclimated to 21 °C, which is opposite to that found in a previous study, where constant stress at 21 °C was thought to exacerbate differences among females
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. The opposing results may reflect the different types of acclimation experienced by females in the two experiments
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup>. In the earlier study, females spent their entire lives at 21 °C, and this developmental acclimation to chronic stress may have allowed differences among females to accumulate over time. Here, acclimation was acute (only during the last weeks of reproductive conditioning), and may reflect a more typical, short-term stress response that was similar among females
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>
 </sup>. Taken together, that egg size plasticity occurred with only a few weeks of acute acclimation suggests that stickleback females can fine-tune resource allocation ‘decisions’ just prior to egg laying, even if basal egg size determination is based on accumulated lifetime exposure or possible early-life exposure to different temperatures
