<p id="Par11" class="p">The most striking findings of this study are that environmental predictability plays a major role in marine stickleback offspring size variation, and that mothers can allocate resources to eggs differently depending on the mean and variance of the thermal environment they experience just prior to egg laying. In addition, offspring size reaction norms strongly depended on the type of environmental predictability (predictably variable vs. stochastic) they experienced. Finally, release of cryptic genetic variation for offspring size when reared in stochastically fluctuating environments suggests hidden evolutionary potential of this population to respond to the predicted increase in ocean climate variability.</p>
