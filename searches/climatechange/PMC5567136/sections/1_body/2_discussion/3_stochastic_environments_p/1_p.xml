<p id="Par14" class="p">Offspring grew best when reared in stochastic environments, regardless of maternal acclimation environment. Overall, offspring were largest in the stochastic environment and smallest when reared at constant 21 °C, whereas offspring reared at 17 °C and the predictably variable environment were similarly sized (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Stochastic environments may promote large size in ectotherms because of the nonlinear and exposure time-dependent relationship between temperature and performance

 </sup>. For instance, chronic exposure to elevated temperature may have detrimental effects on performance, whereas occasional acute exposure to temperatures near or above a critical maximum may benefit organisms by allowing for short bursts of increased activity

 </sup>. For this population, body size and shape variance show nonlinear reaction norms to a temperature range encompassing a 4 °C increase and decrease around the annual mean of 17 °C. Specifically, sibling offspring reared at 13 °C were as large as those reared at 17 °C, but rearing at 21 °C resulted in the common finding of smaller size at elevated temperature

 </sup> but also to low temperatures (14 °C) that favour fast growth in this population may have contributed to overall larger body sizes in the stochastic environment treatment. Likewise, nonlinear or non-additive effects of temperature on performance may also explain why offspring in the predictably variable environment were not intermediate in size between the constant 17 °C and 21 °C environments. Rather, offspring that were exposed to weekly fluctuations between the two temperatures were similarly sized to offspring reared at 17 °C, and both were considerably larger than offspring reared at 21 °C. Short-term exposures to high temperature during development can increase both optimal temperature and maximal growth rate at the optimum via thermal hardening

 </sup>. For example, diurnal fluctuations in temperature have been shown to increase heat shock protein synthesis and heat tolerance, and reduce maximum metabolic rates

 </sup>. Here, the time scale of temperature exposure may have altered the thermal sensitivity of offspring growth performance curves, with week long exposures to elevated temperature being long enough to induce physiological adjustments, but not too long as to lead to performance declines.
