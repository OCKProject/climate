<p id="Par15" class="p">Offspring body size was not influenced by an overall effect of maternal acclimation environment or TGP (an interaction between maternal and offspring environments; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This is in contrast to two previous studies using stickleback females acclimated to constant environments

 </sup>. In the first study, acute acclimation of females did not result in egg size plasticity, so differences in offspring growth were not influenced by initial size. Rather, maternal transgenerational effects on offspring size were mediated by the inheritance of optimised mitochondria

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. In the second study, developmental acclimation of females led to egg size plasticity, influencing offspring size, but TGP was still present, in that smaller eggs from 21 °C mothers grew to become relatively larger offspring

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. An underlying physiological mechanism was not investigated in the second study, but it is clear that egg size (e.g. yolk quantity) is only one factor contributing to offspring growth trajectories (see also ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>). Egg quality mediated by maternal transfer of somatic factors (hormones, cell structures such as mitochondria) and epigenetic variation including heritable gene expression patterns

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>

 </sup>. Here, the period of acute acclimation was two weeks shorter than that used in a previous study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>, so it may simply be that females did not experience environmental cues long enough to mount a response (see also ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>). Nevertheless, the shorter acclimation period was sufficient to induce egg size plasticity. Random variation of selective factors (e.g. SST) in seasonal environments across years
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup> may have contributed to the faster ‘ripening’ of females during the reproductive conditioning phase. Indeed, SSTs were unusually warm during the winter preceding the experiment when adult fish were caught (data available at

As a cautionary note, GLMMs that did not include the G × E interaction term as a random effect showed a significant Dam °C × offspring °C interaction. However, this indication for TGP was spurious, as it was driven by smaller mean size in the stochastic environment for offspring of 21 °C mothers (seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and not by larger offspring size in the matching maternal environment (indicative of adaptive TGP), highlighting the need to account for effects of G × E into analyses of TGP
