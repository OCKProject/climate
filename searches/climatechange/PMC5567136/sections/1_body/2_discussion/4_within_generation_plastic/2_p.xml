 </sup>. Phenotypic plasticity is an effective means for organisms to respond to changing environments. Most studies have investigated reaction norms over two constant environments, comparing the response of genotypes to changes in the mean value of some variable

Rearing individuals under predictable (e.g. diurnal) and stochastic environmental change may more accurately reflect responses to climate change because many organisms encounter daily fluctuations in temperature, and temperature variability is predicted to affect fitness-related traits to a greater extent than changes to mean temperature alone

 </sup>. Here, families responded differently to not only changes in mean temperature, but also to changes in the variability and predictability of temperature fluctuations. Many (but not all) families responded to a mean increase of 4 °C with decreased body size, whereas predictably variable and stochastic environmental fluctuations led to large differences in phenotypic variation between these environments compared to constant conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Interestingly, family reaction norms also changed depending on the type of environmental predictability, in that offspring size in the stochastic environment differed from that seen in the predictably variable environment, which was itself most similar to ambient (17 °C), constant conditions. Environments that fluctuate in a predictable way (e.g. seasonality) are thought to impose more benign impacts on organisms than ‘noisy’ fluctuating environments

 </sup>, and this was likely reflected in the predictably variable environment. Overall, the presence of G × E interactions indicates that, at least for this population, thermal reaction norms for offspring body size have the potential to evolve
