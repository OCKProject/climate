 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and some families did show evidence for adaptive TGP at 21 °C in the early growth phase (e.g. reaction norms between 17 °C and 21 °C for families 64 × 164, 20 × 125 and 37 × 140 in the Dam 21 °C acclimation treatment at 30d; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), but these effects were dampened by other family reaction norms in the opposite direction (genetic variation for TGP), and to an increasing influence over time of genetic effects on offspring phenotypic variation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). For instance, release of cryptic genetic variation (see below) promoting G × E interactions may have contributed to offspring environment overriding any potential maternal influence on reaction norms.
