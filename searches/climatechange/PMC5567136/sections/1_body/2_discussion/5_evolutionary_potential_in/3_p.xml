<p id="Par20" class="p">The extent to which the findings from this study translate to other fish species is difficult to gauge, mostly because few non-commercial species have been studied so intensively from both a genetic and non-genetic perspective. Moreover, very few experiments have simultaneously investigated the role of environmental predictability in evolutionary potential. Additive genetic variance is one source of fitness variation available for selection, but non-additive genetic and maternal environmental effects can also substantially alter evolutionary trajectories

Stickleback have a high ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions as evidenced by their cosmopolitan distribution across the Northern hemisphere spanning latitudes from the arctic to the Mediterranean, and concomitant past exposure to a broad range of environmental conditions and selection pressures (e.g. temperature, salinity, season length, habitats, predators

Likewise, a series of studies of the spiny damselfish (a tropical fish species inhabiting waters where environmental conditions do not vary greatly) also showed that TGP, WGP, genetic and maternal variance all contribute to the adaptive potential of populations under rapid ocean warming
