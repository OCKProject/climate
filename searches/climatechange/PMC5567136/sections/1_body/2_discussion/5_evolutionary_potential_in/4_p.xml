<p id="Par21" class="p">To conclude, the interplay between genetic and non-genetic effects, environmental predictability and evolutionary potential has received little attention to date, but elegant new studies are accumulating. Quantifying the effects of an increase in both the mean and variability of environmental conditions is necessary to predict the ecological and evolutionary responses of populations to future climate change

 </sup>. Here, rearing stickleback offspring in stochastically varying thermal environments produced phenotypic variation not normally seen in constant environment conditions, suggesting that evolutionary potential may be underestimated when the influence of thermal variability is not taken into account. Ideally, future experiments would manipulate changes to environmental variability in conjunction with directional changes to the mean, both within and across generations, as their interaction(s) has been shown to have the largest impacts on organisms
