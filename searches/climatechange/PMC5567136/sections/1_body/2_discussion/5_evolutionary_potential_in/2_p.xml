 </sup>. Here, genetic variance was highest at 21 °C in the earliest developmental stage of offspring, and may reflect an initial stress response to a directional increase in mean temperature

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>). At later growth stages, the highest genetic variances were seen under stochastic environmental change (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Increased V
 <sub class="sub">G</sub> in the stochastic environment could also reflect a stress response given that populations likely do not regularly experience such large fluctuations within short time periods, and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations has been shown to influence stress levels in salmonids

 </sup>. Alternatively, the stochastic environment more closely mimicked conditions experienced in the wild than constant environments reflecting the mean thermal regime experienced in nature, resulting in a better representation of the actual phenotypic variance available for selection to act on

 </sup>. For instance, an oceanic stickleback population showed a massive increase in additive genetic variance due to release of cryptic genetic variation when reared under low salinity conditions mimicking the colonisation of freshwater habitats

 </sup>. Taken together, the results of the current study show that changing environmental conditions can release otherwise cryptic genetic variation that can consequently alter the evolutionary potential of a population. Given that short-term temperature fluctuations and extreme events like heat waves are predicted to increase in the near future

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>, stickleback populations must (and do) harbour substantial amounts of standing genetic variation in order to adapt quickly to local environmental conditions.
