 <p class="p" xmlns="">Yesterday night we experienced strong winds. We had ‘ipo-ipo’, a small tornado. Here in one of our town. Some houses lost their roof. Blown away! But luckily there were only small injuries. This is why I am arranging some cleaning operations for the branches that fell off the trees.</p>
