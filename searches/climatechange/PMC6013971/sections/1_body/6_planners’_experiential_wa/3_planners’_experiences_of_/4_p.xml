<p class="p">As a response to these climate-related issues, MPDCs reported changes in socio-spatial practices. In the case of sea level rise and salt intrusion of rice paddies, several MPDCs reported that farmers are converting their rice paddies into mangrove plantations. As one MPDC whose municipality contains reef islets claims, households from small island 
 <italic class="italic">barangays</italic> are building their houses higher ‘to adapt to the rising sea level’. For coastal land owners on the main island, those who can afford it are building sea walls, including in front of resort developments, for instance. Land use conversion and changes in building practices are thus autonomous forms of adaptation undertaken on the basis of individuals and communities’ lay understandings of climate change. These represent a form of local knowledge that planning officers ‘upscale’ and integrate as part of their professional experience about climate change within their municipality.
