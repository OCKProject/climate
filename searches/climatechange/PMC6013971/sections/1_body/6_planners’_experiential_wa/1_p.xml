<p class="p">An important diversity of answers was provided when addressing the idea of ‘climate change’ with planning officers from the coastal municipalities of Bohol. These ranged from reporting and describing climate-related hazards experienced within the municipality to enumerating adaptive measures currently undertaken by the planning and development office, along with personal perceptions of change in the weather and seasons. As the material was coded according to the framework suggested by Cloke et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), the following patterns emerged: planning officers consider climate change simultaneously as (1) a 
 <italic class="italic">reality</italic> they observe on a daily basis, (2) a 
 <italic class="italic">problem</italic> they should address through their planning activities and (3) an 
 <italic class="italic">agenda</italic> affecting their tools and practices (see 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). While this betrays what Brace and Geoghegan (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:2) describe as the ‘definitional ambiguity’ of climate change, it also shows that planners relate to climate change by mobilising hybrid forms of knowledge involving various sets of experiences. We successively detail how these three ways of knowing about climate change play out as experiential knowledge in planning officers’ narratives about past, present and future development and planning practices.
