<p class="p">Thirdly, planning officers understand climate change as an agenda. Their accounts of climate change also draw upon a law requirement from the 
 <italic class="italic">2009 Climate Change Act</italic> that sets climate change at the planning and development agenda. In particular, planners’ experiential way of knowing climate change is built upon their duty-based responsibility of integrating climate change adaptation into local development plans, including the municipal Comprehensive Land Use Development Plan. The latter is viewed by MPDCs as an important planning tool for addressing climate-related risks. Qualified by an informant as ‘do’s and don’ts’, it allows determining ‘climate risk-free areas’, and defining zones where development can and cannot be located. As a means of integrating climate change adaptation into local development plans, planning offices consider integrating the municipal DRRM plans into the revised CLUPs as essential.
