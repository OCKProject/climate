<p class="p">Besides, while scientific knowledge from IPCC assessments exerts considerable hegemony over the climate change debate (Hulme &amp; Mahony 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), scientific knowledge that is claimed by its producers to have universal authority is received and interpreted very differently in different political and cultural settings. For instance, the consensus science of the IPCC might look persuasive from the centralised sites of production, and the global knowledge that it produces ‘helps governments erect and then justify their simplified constructions of people and nature, and the institutions based on them’ (Fogel 2004:109). However, the views from the peripheries of space, power and culture – the very places where knowledge is consumed for developing adaptive capacity and action – look very different. As Adger et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) showed, reactions to climate change and rising sea levels are embedded in much wider stories about the economic, cultural and demographic aspirations, and explain why universal and globalised constructions of climate and adaptation often fail to connect with the local.
