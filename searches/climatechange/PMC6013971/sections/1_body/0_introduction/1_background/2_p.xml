<p class="p">Integrating local level and scientific knowledge is often highly valued for effectively addressing climate change (Cash &amp; Moser 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for instance, supports with ‘robust evidence’ that the ‘integration of local knowledge with additional scientific and technical knowledge can improve disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation’ (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:15). Scientific knowledge is commonly understood as knowledge generated systematically from formalised, explicit processes and principles, such as scientifically acknowledged methods and theories. Local knowledge, in turn, often refers to a broad set of knowledge situated in specific locales that reflects expertise and understanding of local phenomena (Raymond et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, the status of local knowledge in relation to scientific knowledge and its relevance in the face of future climate change remains contested (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Bringing together and making use of local and scientific knowledge is not straightforward (Kristjanson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) and it is often difficult for individuals and organisations to handle both kinds of knowledge.
