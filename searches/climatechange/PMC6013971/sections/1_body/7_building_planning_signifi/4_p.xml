<p class="p">These kinds of place-based, non-scientific ways of knowing often rest on planning officers’ sense of place. In the case of exposure to coastal floods, for instance, MPDCs referred to their municipality’s specific geographical context such as being part of the Maribojoc bay, or being protected by neighbourhood islands such as Panglao or the islets from the northern double coral reef barrier (see

 <italic class="italic">Tinabilan</italic>, meaning ‘screened’ or ‘shielded’, by reference to the fact that the city is protected on the southwest from the open sea and strong monsoon winds by the nearby island of Panglao. This kind of understanding of municipalities’ physical landscapes supports planning officers’ sense of place and allows them to build planning significance by combining both scientific and local ways of knowing.
