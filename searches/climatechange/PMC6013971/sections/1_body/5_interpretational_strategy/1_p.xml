<p class="p">For the purpose of this study, we embraced what Cloke et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) describe as the artisan figure or researcher. Through a detailed and close reading of interview transcripts, this interpretational strategy provides a mode of understanding planners’ world views as it is revealed in their everyday experience, encounters and utterances. Drawing upon the best known and most widely applied grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1967</xref>), it follows a set of procedures that offer clear guidelines for practice, without being overly rigid or prescriptive. Throughout the analysis, both manifest (content) and latent (discourses) data were considered. Categorisation and theoretical constructions evolved simultaneously in a two-way relationship. Oscillating between these two approaches thus became particularly relevant as informants’ realities were analysed as embodied performances of broader social and institutional discourses.
