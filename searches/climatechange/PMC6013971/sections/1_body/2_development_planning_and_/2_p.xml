 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>:16). Planners’ situated knowledge and awareness of local sensitivities, including the interactions between biophysical and social contexts, is important in understanding local phenomena, balancing competing priorities and values, policy making and managing socio-ecological systems (Berkes &amp; Folke 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Picketts et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). They can be viewed as key stakeholders for bridging the gap between top-down and bottom-up actions.
