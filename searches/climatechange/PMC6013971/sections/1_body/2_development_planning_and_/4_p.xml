In particular, little is known on how local climate change knowledge is made and modified in the context of development planning institutions, especially in relation to plannersâ€™ knowledge sets and experiences. While most research focuses on the ways actors and institutions can better mainstream climate change adaptation into local policy and practice through the integration of climate change into local development plans (see, for instance, Hedger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Lasco et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), the literature lacks evidence showing how local actors from the municipal level perceive climate change and the adaptation challenge in their daily practice of land use management.
