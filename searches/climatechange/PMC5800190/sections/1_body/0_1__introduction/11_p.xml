<p class="p">This paper is meant to fill in some of the gaps in current studies on climate change by examining the different roles of individual and societal factors in shaping public perception of climate change. Taiwan, a place with a strong Eastern culture facing high risks of climate change, is used to explore the perceptions of climate change and the influencing factors. Specifically, we (1) differentiate the perceptions of risks from climate change into two dimensions: global severity and personal threat; (2) analyze the roles of gender, age, education, experiences of climate-related disaster and risk awareness (anxiety), marital status, employment status, household income, and perceived social status in shaping risk perception of climate change; and finally, (3) investigate the impacts of social networks, including religion, political affiliations, and organizational embeddedness, on risk perceptions.</p>
