<p class="p">Taiwan is an ideal place to examine the public perception of climate change because it is facing serious climate change issues [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and climate change-induced threats of disasters. Taiwan is situated in one of the main paths of tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean and has experienced a series of typhoons with extraordinary amounts of rainfall and intense winds. Between 1958 and 2015, Taiwan experienced an average of 4.88 typhoon strikes per year [

 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Climate change is considered to be playing an important role in the increase of typhoons [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The increasing trend of climate change-related weather is a topic of policy debates [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The Taiwanese government has made a commitment to mitigate climate change [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], but the cooperation and coping of the public have yet to show any serious adaptations. Most of the current studies on climate change in Taiwan focus on the “hard” science aspect or the potential impacts, such as on water resources [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], the fishing industry [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], and infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], of climate change. An understanding of the public’s perception of climate change and the communication of information about climate change to the public are critical [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, other than a study with a tiny sample, we have not found any significant investigations of this topic [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Our analysis uses an updated (2013), representative sample from Taiwan to investigate the public’s perception of climate change.
