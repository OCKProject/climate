<p class="p">Two dimensions, global severity and personal threat, of risk perceptions of climate change were measured. For the first dimension, survey participants were asked, “Do you think climate change is a serious problem for the whole world?” For the second dimension, they were asked, “How much anxiety do you have about the potential impact of climate change on you and your family?” The answers to both questions were measured by a five-point Likert scale, but were recoded as binary variables for analysis because the data distribution violated the parallel assumptions [

 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. For global severity, the answers of “not severe at all, not so severe, not clear” were coded as “0”, whereas the choices of “somewhat severe, very severe” were coded as “1”. Similarly, for personal threat, the answers of “no anxiety at all, low anxiety, difficult to say” were coded as “0”, whereas “some anxiety, high anxiety” were coded as “1”.
