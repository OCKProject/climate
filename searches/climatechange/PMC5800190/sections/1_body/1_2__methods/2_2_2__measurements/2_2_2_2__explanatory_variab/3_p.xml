<p class="p">Religion, organizational embeddedness, and political affiliations were the three variables adopted for the societal factors influencing the risk perception of climate change. Religion was originally measured by various specific types and coded into three categories: the non-believers (no religious affiliation), believers in Eastern religions (Buddhism, Taoism, I-Kuan Tao, Islam, folk faith and other local religions), and believers in Western religions (Christian or Catholicism). Organizational embeddedness was measured with a dummy variable with “1” representing membership in at least one proposed club/group, including political groups, community management boards, social service groups, religious groups, entertainment clubs, and labor unions. Organizational embeddedness represents the public participation of a respondent and is linked to social networks. Here, we intended to probe the correlations between risk perception and social networks. The political affiliation was measured by voting behaviors in the 2012 election, which was about half a year before the survey. The answers were clustered into four categories: voted for DPP (Democratic Progressive Party), voted for KMT (Kuo Min Tang) or PFP (People First Party), did not vote (no party), and ineligible to vote.</p>
