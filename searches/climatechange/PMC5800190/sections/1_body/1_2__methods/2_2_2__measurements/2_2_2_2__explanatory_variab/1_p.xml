<p class="p">Climate-related disaster experience was a dummy variable indicating experiences of typhoons or inundations since 1993. The survey questions for this variable were, “How many times have you experienced typhoons/inundations since 1993?” and “How many times have you experienced inundations due to typhoons or heavy rainfall since 1993?”. If a respondent provided positive answers (non-zero) to either of the two questions, the variable was coded as “1”. Otherwise, it was coded as “0”. Typhoons and inundations are common extreme weather experiences that are strongly related to climate change [
