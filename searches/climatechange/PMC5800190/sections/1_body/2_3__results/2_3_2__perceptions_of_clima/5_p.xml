<p class="p">For the influence of the societal factors, people with religious beliefs had a higher likelihood of perceiving climate change risks than those without religious beliefs, but only the effects on perceived personal threat were statistically significant. The positive impact of organizational embeddedness on risk perception was significant only along the dimension of global severity. Concerning political affiliation, voters for DPP were 55% and 65% more likely to perceive risks of global severity and personal impact, respectively, than did those who had not voted in the last elections held in 2012. The KMT or PFP supporters had a lower probability of perceived risks, but it was significant only along the dimension of personal impact. Respondents who were ineligible to vote had a much higher likelihood of reporting the global severity of climate change.</p>
