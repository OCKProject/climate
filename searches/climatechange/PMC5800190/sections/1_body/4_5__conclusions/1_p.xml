<p class="p">In sum, this study has shown that both individual and societal factors play important roles in shaping the risk perceptions of climate change. An individual’s perception of climate change should be differentiated into dimensions of global severity and personal threat. Climate-related disaster experience is not significantly associated with higher risk perceptions of climate change, but anxiety about typhoons does positively correlate with higher risk perceptions of climate change along both dimensions. With higher levels of education, individuals would have higher perceptions of climate change, though the patterns for global severity and personal impact would not be the same. Societal factors, such as religious beliefs, organizational embeddedness, and political orientation, can be representative of ideology which shapes people’s perceptions of climate change.</p>
