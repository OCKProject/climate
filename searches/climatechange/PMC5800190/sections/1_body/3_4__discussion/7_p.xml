<p class="p">This paper contributes to the current understanding of disaster risk reduction in three important ways. First, we extend beyond the existing literature, which usually conflates the perceptions of the impact of climate change on global severity and personal threat [

Our study shows that the personal and global dimensions of perceptions of the severity of climate change are crucially different, and identifies the underlying mechanisms through which the personal dimension may contribute to the adoption of climate-friendly actions. To our knowledge of the literature on climate change, this identification has not yet been done. Second, we provide new insights into the underlying determinants of risk perception by differentiating between the individual and societal factors. By examining the detailed factors in each domain, we have shown that societal factors may have a tremendous influence on promoting risk perceptions. In other words, community individuals can be more motivated to pay attention to risk perceptions of climate change if the surrounding environment is full of such efforts. Third, considering the fact that there exist relatively few studies on the impact of religious factors on risk perceptions of climate change, the ideological analysis is even scarcer. This paper provides new empirical evidence of the deep-seated religious beliefs in the domain of risk perception of climate change.
