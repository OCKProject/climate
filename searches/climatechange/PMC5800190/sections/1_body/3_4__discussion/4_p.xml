<p class="p">Our results demonstrate that having experienced climate-related disaster is not significantly associated with perceptions of the severity of climate change along global or personal dimensions. In other words, prior experiences of disasters do not seem to play a significant role in enhancing risk perceptions of climate change, since people who have been affected by a disaster may lack strong evidence to link a specific disaster to climate change [

However, anxiety about typhoons and risk perceptions of climate change are significantly and positively correlated along both global and personal dimensions. Since local images of climate change are usually composed of extreme weather events and in Taiwan, tropical typhoons occur from June to October [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-15-00091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], the Taiwanese people pay close attention to typhoon risks. Therefore, these results provide strong evidence for studies that take extreme weather events as the main phenomena in discussions of issues of climate change in the academic field of disaster studies [
