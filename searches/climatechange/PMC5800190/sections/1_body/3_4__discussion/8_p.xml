<p class="p">There are two main limitations of this study. The first limitation is in the research design. Since we used secondary data, i.e., data designed and collected by other scholars, and since climate change is only one part of the data collection efforts, some climate change issues like rising sea levels were not included. Future studies with specific designs for risk perception and climate change could remedy this. The second limitation concerns the methodology. Like other studies that rely on data from cross-sectional questionnaire surveys, this study largely relied on individual subjective reports of risk perception of climate change. Perceptions may have been overestimated by the respondents due to social desirability bias. Moreover, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, we are unable to make causal claims on the correlation between the proposed influencing factors and the risk perception of climate change, though we have chosen the most appropriate strategies for data analysis by considering the data structures and theories. Thus, future studies that include both subjective risk perception of climate change and objective measures should be conducted, and longitudinal studies are desirable to understand the causes and effects.</p>
