<p class="p">As we expected, people perceive the potential impacts of climate change differently along the two dimensions. These differences require a critical explanation of why higher risk perceptions do not necessarily demonstrate a robust capability to cope with potential disasters [

Having higher risk perceptions of the global dimension does not necessarily link to higher risk perception at the individual level, which in turn cannot motivate individuals to adopt climate-friendly actions. Although, in this paper, we cannot trace the exact mechanisms underlying the effects, our main argument is as follows. In the absence of differentiating the risk perception of the global dimension from the personal dimension, discussions about the effectiveness of education on risk perception are unilateral and may guide decision-making bodies in the wrong direction. The previous literature has shown that plans of risk preparedness could be positively influenced by socially accepted standards or media campaigns [

Therefore, in order to understand how people represent objects and events mentally, more consideration should be given to the difference in the psychological distance between global severity and personal threat as regards climate change.
