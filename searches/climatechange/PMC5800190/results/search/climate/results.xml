 <result pre="educated individuals have a higher probability of risk perception regarding" exact="climate" post="change. Since more knowledge can be assimilated when more"/>

 <result pre="71]. As we expected, people perceive the potential impacts of" exact="climate" post="change differently along the two dimensions. These differences require"/>
 <result pre="psychological distance between global severity and personal threat as regards" exact="climate" post="change. Our results demonstrate that having experienced climate-related disaster"/>

 <result pre="largely relied on individual subjective reports of risk perception of" exact="climate" post="change. Perceptions may have been overestimated by the respondents"/>
 <result pre="between the proposed influencing factors and the risk perception of" exact="climate" post="change, though we have chosen the most appropriate strategies"/>
 <result pre="Thus, future studies that include both subjective risk perception of" exact="climate" post="change and objective measures should be conducted, and longitudinal"/>

 <result pre="about typhoons does positively correlate with higher risk perceptions of" exact="climate" post="change along both dimensions. With higher levels of education,"/>
 <result pre="higher levels of education, individuals would have higher perceptions of" exact="climate" post="change, though the patterns for global severity and personal"/>
