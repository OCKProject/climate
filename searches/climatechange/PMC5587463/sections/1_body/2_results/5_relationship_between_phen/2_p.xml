<p class="p">For leaf‐out date, 49 of 50 species (98%) were sensitive to temperature, exhibiting a significant negative relationship, thus leaf‐out dates being earlier in warmer years (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). No species showed a significant positive relationship between leaf‐out date and temperature. The mean sensitivity of leaf‐out to temperature was −3.11 day/°C, while sensitivities ranged from −0.96 days/°C to −7.65 days/°C (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). For 29 species, leaf‐out date was most sensitive to spring temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>a): Twelve species were most strongly associated with April temperatures; 10 species were most strongly associated with mean temperature of March and April; seven species were most strongly associated with the mean temperature of March, April, and May.
