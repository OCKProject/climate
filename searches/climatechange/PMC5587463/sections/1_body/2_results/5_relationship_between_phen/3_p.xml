<p class="p">Forty‐eight of 52 species (92%) showed significant sensitivity in flowering time to temperature (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Flowering time, for most species, was correlated with spring temperatures (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>b): Twenty‐one species were most strongly associated with April temperatures, while 13 species were most strongly associated with the mean temperature of April and May. Flowering time sensitivity to spring temperature did not necessarily depend on flowering time seasonality, with several late flowering species (June, July) exhibiting response to spring temperatures (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The average response of flowering time response to temperature was −2.87 day/°C (range: −6.42 days/°C to 5.54 days/°C). Only two species, 
 <italic class="italic">Acanthopanax sessiliflorus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lonicera tatarinowii</italic>, exhibited delayed flowering.
