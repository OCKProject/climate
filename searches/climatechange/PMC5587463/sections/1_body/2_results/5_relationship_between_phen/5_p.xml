<p class="p">The response of leaf‐out date to temperature predicted the response of flowering time to temperatures (β = 0.27,

Leaf‐out date response to winter precipitation did predict flowering time response to winter precipitation, such that species with more responsive FLD also had more responsive FFD (β = 0.62,
