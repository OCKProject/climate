<p class="p">The correlations between FLD and FFD and winter precipitation were not strong (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The correlation coefficients of leaf‐out date of 43 species (86%) against winter precipitation were positive, but only four of them were significant (mean slope = 1.09). Correlation coefficients of leaf‐out date of the other seven species were negative, although none was significant (mean slope = −0.54). Similar to leaf‐out date, flowering time of 43 species (83%) correlated positively with winter precipitation, 12 significantly (mean slope = 1.43). The nine remaining species were negatively correlated with precipitation, but none was significant (mean slope = −0.72). In addition, the interaction of winter precipitation and temperature did not have significant influence on leaf‐out and flowering time for all but two species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>).
