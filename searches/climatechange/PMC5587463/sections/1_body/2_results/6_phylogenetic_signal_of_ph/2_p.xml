<p class="p">The phenological response of leaf‐out date to spring temperature (MAM) exhibited marginally significant phylogenetic signal, and significant phylogenetic signal was found for flowering time response to spring temperature (AM; Table

Species in family Rosaceae (ten species in total) were particularly sensitive to spring temperature for both FLD and FFD, and all three species in family Ulmaceae and Saxifragaceae, and both species in family Ericaceae showed a strong response to temperature for both FLD and FFD (Table
