 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S10</xref>b; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33207-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>), indicating that early season leaf‐out species have a greater response to winter precipitation than late season leaf‐out species.
