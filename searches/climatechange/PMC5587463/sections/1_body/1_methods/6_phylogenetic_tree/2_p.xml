<p class="p">We built a phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequence data, which were collected from GenBank for 47 species (90% and 94% species for flowering and leafing phenology, respectively). We used the program 
 <italic class="italic">phyloGenerator2</italic> (Pearse &amp; Purvis, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) to download, align, and concatenate sequence data from GenBank for the following markers: 
 <italic class="italic">atp1</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> atpB</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> matR</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> rbcL</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> matK</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> psbA</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> ITS</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> ndhF</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> trnL‐trnF</italic>. There were a total of 15,834 sites in the final concatenated matrix. Further alignment was performed by visual inspection. Using the concatenated matrix, partitioned for each marker, 100 maximum‐likelihood (ML) bootstrap phylogenies were constructed using RAxML‐HPC v8 on the CIPRES portal v3.3 (Miller, Pfeiffer, &amp; Schwartz, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). A constraint tree was used to preserve known relationships. Time‐corrected branch lengths were than estimated for all 100 ml bootstrap trees based on seven major angiosperm node ages obtained from Bell et al. (Bell, Soltis, &amp; Soltis,
