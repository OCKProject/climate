<p class="p">The phenological data for this study were from the Chinese Phenological Observation Network, which was established in 1963. More than 170 woody species have been monitored for first leaf‐out date and first‐flowering date since 1963 in the Forest Botanical Garden. Botanical gardens are good sites for studying the effects of climate change on phenology (Primack &amp; Miller‐Rushing,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Most of the trees were transplanted more than 30 years ago (personal communication with employed gardeners). There were 235 native species (41 families and 95 genera) and 97 introduced species documented in Heilongjiang province (Zhou,

The FLD and FFD are defined as the date when individual plant of a given species unfolded the first young leaves and the first full flower, respectively. Unfortunately, data collection for the site has not been continuous. Observations were stopped from 1966 to 1972 and also throughout 1989–2002 due to the lack of financial support. Therefore, data for this study cover the periods 1963–1966, 1973–1989, and 2003–2014. In addition, there are some missing data points in a few years for certain species.
