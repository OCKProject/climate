<p class="p">The phenological response for each species to temperature was quantified as the slope of a linear regression model of leaf‐out/flowering date versus temperature. Linear regression to study the phenological response to temperature and precipitation has been widely used in previous studies (e.g., Abu‐Asab, Peterson, Shetler, &amp; Orli,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We used single month temperature in the preceding months to leaf‐out/flowering beginning in August of preceding year, average temperature of the preceding two months or average temperature of successive 3‐month intervals beginning in August of preceding year. We selected the best model for each species based on Akaike information criterion (AIC).
