<p class="p">Phenology data were collected at the Forest Botanical Garden of Heilongjiang Province in the city of Harbin (Northeast China; 45.7°N,126.6°E). During 1951–2012, the annual mean temperature is 4.25°C, and extreme temperatures have ranged from −42.6°C to 39.2°C, and the mean yearly maximum and minimum temperatures are 23.0°C in July and −18.4°C in January, respectively. This area has an annual mean precipitation of 524 mm, and receives most of this precipitation (77%) during summer and early autumn (June–September). The winter precipitation refers to snowfall rather than rainfall from last November to March in our study site, and serves as a proxy for snowmelt out date. There was no irrigation in the garden, so winter precipitation could provide water plant needed to growth in early spring. The elevation ranges between 136 and 155 m.</p>
