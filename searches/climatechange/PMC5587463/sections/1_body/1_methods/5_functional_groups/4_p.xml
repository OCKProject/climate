<p class="p">To compare the difference of “phenological response to temperature/winter precipitation” between groups (non‐native vs. native, wind‐ vs. animal‐pollinated, dry‐ vs. fleshy‐fruited), we performed phylogenetic analyzes correcting for phylogenetic relationships to account for the potential effect of the shared evolutionary history of species. We used “pgls” in the package “

For earliness of leaf‐out/flowering, “pgls” was used to investigate whether FFD and FLD were correlated with their corresponding phenological response to temperature and winter precipitation. A negative correlation would indicate that species with an early phenology are more sensitivity to interannual climate variation.
