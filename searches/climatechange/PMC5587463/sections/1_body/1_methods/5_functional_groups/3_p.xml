<p class="p">It is difficult to compare the phenological response of the best temperature model across species because they may not be responding to the same temperature cues during the same time of year. By making the response variable consistent, we can more easily compare species. Therefore, we calculated the phenological response to mean temperature of March, April, and May (MAM) for FLD and mean temperature of April and May (AM) for FFD as a standardized comparison of response across all species to spring temperatures. We chose these months because, for most species, FLD was correlated with March, April, or May temperatures, while FFD was correlated with April or May temperatures (see Fig.

Thus, we calculated the phylogenetic signals and compared differences in the phenological response among functional groups to spring temperature (i.e., mean temperature of MAM for FLD and mean temperature of AM for FFD). This method of using a single temperature combination for each phenophase to study the difference among functional groups has been widely used to study phenological response to climate change (e.g., Beaubien &amp; Freeland,
