<p class="p">We did not find that winter precipitation had a significant impact on spring phenology for most species tested. This is consistent with previous studies (e.g., Abu‐Asab et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Sparks, Huber, &amp; Croxton, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) that reported no significant correlation between flowering time and precipitation. However, our results are contrary to Lesica and Kittelson (
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) work on herbaceous broad‐leaved species conducted in Montana, USA (46°N), which showed that mean first‐flowering date advanced with a decline in winter precipitation (mainly in the form of snow). One reason is higher precipitation in winter at this site meant greater snowpack, later snowmelt and hence later flowering. This association has been reported for mountain wildflowers; snowmelt date was the primary determinant of flowering time in

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Inouye, Saavedra, &amp; Lee‐Yang, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Alternatively, increased soil moisture due to greater snowpack could be a mechanism driving earlier phenology (Wolkovich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, whether the winter snowpack advances or delays spring phenology depends on the relative importance of its advantage and disadvantage.
