<p class="p">Interestingly, we found the response of leaf‐out date to spring temperature could predict the response of flowering time to spring temperatures. In addition, the response of leaf‐out date to winter precipitation could predict the response of flowering time to winter precipitation. Furthermore, the flowering phenological response to temperature could predict the flowering response to winter precipitation. This finding suggests that mechanisms of sensing climate for spring phenology may not be independent, with species having stronger responses to abiotic factors for leaf‐out phenology under the climate change scenario tend to have stronger responses for flowering phenology, indicating that the response to climate of one phenological event might help predict that of another.</p>
