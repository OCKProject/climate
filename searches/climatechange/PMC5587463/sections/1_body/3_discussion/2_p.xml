<p class="p">This study is the first to assess whether the leaf‐out phenological response to climate factors exhibits phylogenetic signal and the first to document whether the leaf‐out response to climate is different among plant functional groups. We found phylogeny to be significant predictor of both phenological timing, as well as, phenological response to climate in this Botanical garden. In contrast, with few exceptions, we found most functional groups to be poor predictors of phenological response to climate.</p>
