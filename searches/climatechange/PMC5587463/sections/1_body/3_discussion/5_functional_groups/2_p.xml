<p class="p">It has been found that temperate species that flower early in the growing season (e.g., spring ephemerals) are more responsive to temperature (Calinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Fitter &amp; Fitter, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Menzel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) and is likely an adaptation to the higher temperature variability in spring months (Menzel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, we found that neither early season leaf‐out nor flowering species did not show greater phenological response to temperature than late season species. This may reflect one possible strategy that early season species at higher latitudes are unable to advance leaf‐out and flowering dates because abiotic conditions constrain them (e.g., snowfall continues well into April at our site). For example, one study showed that flower buds of a few species are sensitive to frost in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA, and the earlier beginning of the growing season under global warming has exposed them to more frequent mid‐June frost kills (Inouye, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We also found early season leaf‐out species tend to have a greater phenological response to winter precipitation, showing that snowfall in winter would benefit early leaf‐out species by increased soil moisture due to greater snowpack.
