<p class="p">Although few studies were carried out to compare the phenology between non‐fleshy‐fruited species and fleshy‐fruited species (e.g., Bolmgren &amp; Lönnberg,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), our research is the first study to assess the phenological response among fruit types, and found that non‐fleshy‐fruited species showed similar phenological response to both temperature and winter precipitation as did fleshy‐fruited species. The mechanisms behind this pattern need further investigation.
