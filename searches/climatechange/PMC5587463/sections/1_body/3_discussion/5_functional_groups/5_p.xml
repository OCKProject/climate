<p class="p">The association between phenological response and pollination syndrome remains largely untested and the few studies that have investigated it show mixed results. Calinger et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) found spring flowering wind‐pollinated species to be more phenologically responsive than animal‐pollinated species in north‐central North America. In contrast, Dai et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013a</xref>) found greater advancement of flowering with increased temperature among biotically pollinated species with a weaker response among wind‐pollinated species. We found no significant difference between wind‐pollinated species and animal‐pollinated species in phenological changes in response to both temperature and winter precipitation, indicating that at higher latitudes, wind‐pollinated species, and animal‐pollinated species could convergence on their response to climate change.
