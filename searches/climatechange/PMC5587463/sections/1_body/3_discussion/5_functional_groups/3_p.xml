<p class="p">In recent years, a few studies have found non‐native species tend to be more responsive to temperature than native species (e.g., Hulme,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Wolkovich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). One of the dominant explanations is the “vacant phenological niche model,” which suggests that the most successful invaders are phenologically more flexible and can occupy open temporal niche space near the start or the end of the growing season (Wolkovich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our study is consistent with these findings for FFD. Furthermore, this result is congruent with the conceptual framework that opportunistic taxa (pioneers or exotic species) adopt a more risky strategy and may profit more from a warmer climate than native late‐successional species which show a more “conservative” and more complex response, with a large chilling requirement and photoperiod response (Körner &amp; Basler,
