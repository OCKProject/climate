<p class="p">In contrast, we found no significant difference between non‐native species and native species for leaf‐out response to temperature, and for both FLD and FFD response to winter precipitation. The lack of a difference between non‐native and native species could arise from the compressed growing season in our higher latitude site, where most species leaf‐out and flower within a relatively short window, leaving little open temporal niche space to occupy. In support of this hypothesis, we did not find significant differences between non‐native and native species for leaf‐out date and flowering time. Wolkovich et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) also reported no difference in phenological response to temperature between non‐native and native species for two grassland communities (in contrast, they did find a significant difference in three mesic temperate communities). Instead, Wolkovich et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) found non‐native and native species diverged in their response to precipitation, a pattern we did not find. This suggests that phenological response to climate may not be a globally advantageous trait for successfully non‐native species, and that, specifically, phenological responsiveness to temperature may be limited to mesic temperate communities (Davis et al.,
