<p class="p">Although we only studied 52 woody species and it is a small sample size, there were 235 native species documented in this province (Zhou, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>) and the sample of species in our study represent a reasonable proxy for the local flora. However, many families have only one or two species in our study, therefore, extrapolation beyond the species we looked to draw any phylogenetic conclusions would be unwise.
