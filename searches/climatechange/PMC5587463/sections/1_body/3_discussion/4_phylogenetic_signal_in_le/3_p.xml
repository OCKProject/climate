<p class="p">We also find the evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in the response to temperature for both leaf‐out and flowering phenology. These results are suggestive of a mediating phenological response to climate for certain traits among closely related species and a conserved physiological response to those abiotic conditions (Davies et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Cautions should be taken, however, when inferring such broad evolutionary trends from community level patterns. Indeed, prior studies have found contrasting evidence for phylogenetic signal in flowering time response to temperature (CaraDonna &amp; Inouye, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Davis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Our study provides a similar contrast with regard to flowering time response to temperature and precipitation, with the added novelty–and complexity–of a differing patterns of phylogenetic signal in leaf‐out response. In short, while such phylogenetic patterns are relevant to the given community in question, there does not appear to be a broader phylogenetic pattern of phenological response to climate. Of course, the small numbers of studies that have looked at phenological response to climate limit our ability to make such broad inferences, as well as, identify the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the differences in phylogenetic signal across communities.
