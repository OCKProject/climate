<p class="p">Consistent with other studies, we found evidence in support of phylogenetic signal in leaf‐out date and first‐flowering date (Bolmgren &amp; Cowan,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Panchen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), revealing that more closely related taxa tend to commence spring phenology at similar times during the growing season. The phylogenetic signal in spring phenology may be due in part to its correlation with other phylogenetically conserved traits (Panchen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Closely related species tend to share similar physiological and morphological traits, such as flower size, shape, scent, and nectar production which can determine the attraction and success of pollination, and, thus might influence when species flower (Westoby, Leishman, &amp; Lord, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). In addition, genetically based trait conservatism may play a role–plant physiology might dictate species response to a particular environmental cue, and hence, closely related species would be expected to share similar physiologies and sensitivities (Harvey &amp; Pagel, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>).
