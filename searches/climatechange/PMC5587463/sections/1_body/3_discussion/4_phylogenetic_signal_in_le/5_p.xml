<p class="p">The difference in between the lack of phylogenetic signal in the FFD response to winter precipitation and the presence of phylogenetic signal in FLD may be due to the lack of any real correlation between FLD and winter precipitation itself, with only four species having a significant correlation. As this is the first study to explore the phylogenetic signal in leaf‚Äêout response to winter precipitation, it remains to be tested whether this is a general pattern in other regions and for other species.</p>
