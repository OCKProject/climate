<p class="p">The clades that tended to drive the patterns of phylogenetic signal that we observed in phenological responses to spring temperature included the Rosaceae, Ulmaceae, Saxifragaceae, and Ericaceae families. All species from these families were relatively responsive to temperature for leaf‐out and flowering time. While this is relatively small sample of species to infer broad scale patterns of the evolutionary history phenology in these families, it is notable that all four of these families have been shown to have conserved phenological behavior in other studies in the northern hemisphere (e.g., Panchen et al.,
