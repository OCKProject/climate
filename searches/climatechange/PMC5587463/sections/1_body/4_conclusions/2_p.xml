<p class="p">Our study confirms that both spring phenology (both leaf‐out and flowering phenology) and their responses to spring temperature are constrained by phylogeny, suggesting that phylogenetic relatedness is one potential tool that could be used to predict species response to future climate change in this region. Furthermore, the phylogenetic signal in phenological sensitivity means that future climate change may contribute to an increased loss of phylogenetic diversity in this region, similar to what has been observed in other ecosystems (Willis et al.,
