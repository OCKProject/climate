<p class="p">A growing number of studies have revealed an earlier onset of spring phenology in the northern hemisphere (CaraDonna, Iler, &amp; Inouye,

 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Another meta‐analysis of more than 100,000 phenological time series of 542 European plants found 78% of the species exhibited a trend of advancing leaf‐out and flowering time (Menzel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). More recently, a meta‐analysis restricted to China found that 91% of the spring/summer phenophases for both plants and animals examined exhibited an earlier trend (Ge, Wang, &amp; Dai, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Given these trends, being able to generalize how species phenologically respond to climate is necessary to be able to predict how climate change will impact plant communities around the world.
