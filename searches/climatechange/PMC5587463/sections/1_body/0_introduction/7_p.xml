<p class="p">The spring phenologies at higher latitude where there are heavy snowfall in winter are primarily a consequence of two environmental events, the warm spring temperature and the disappearance of snowpack (Inouye &amp; Wielgolaski, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Climate change at higher latitude includes warming in growth season temperature and receiving more precipitation as rain instead of snow (Johnson, 
 <xref rid="ece33207-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). In this study, we test the degree to which phylogeny and different functional groups predict first leaf‐out date (FLD), first‐flowering date (FFD), and the sensitivity of these two phenological events to temperature and winter precipitation. We take advantage of 52‐year observational phenological dataset that includes 52 woody species from the Forest Botanical Garden of Heilongjiang Province, China. Specifically, we investigate the following questions: 
 <italic class="italic">(1) Do FLD and FFD exhibit phylogenetic signal? (2) Are FLD and FFD sensitive to temperature and winter precipitation? (3) Does the sensitivity of FLD and FFD to temperature and precipitation exhibit phylogenetic signal? (4) Are FLD and FFD and their sensitivity to climate associated with different functional groups including</italic>: native status, pollination syndrome, fruity type, and leaf‐out/flowering time?
