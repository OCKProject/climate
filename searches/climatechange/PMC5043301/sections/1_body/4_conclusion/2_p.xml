<p class="p">We found evidence for impacts of climatic factors on more than half of the species investigated. Changes in aspects of climate were found to have detrimental effects on one out of two amphibians and reptiles. Based on these results, climate change is already having and is anticipated to have a large impact on amphibian and reptilian species. Immediate and ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>] are of utmost importance for amphibians and reptiles of the world. Additionally, intensive general conservation efforts need to be employed to minimize today's main stressors on amphibians and reptiles, i.e. habitat loss [

However, it is impossible to identify the most critical species to target for management given the lack of knowledge for some taxa and regions that we identified. Ideally, future research into the effects of climate change needs to focus on those regions, taxa and questions that to date have had little attention.
