<p class="p">The above analyses combined negative and positive effects of climate change, but there might be difference in the rates at which positive and negative effects were reported. Thus, we also estimated the probabilities of reporting positive effects of climate change on amphibians and reptiles relative to the probabilities of reporting negative effects. Sample sizes for these analyses were smaller than for the previous analyses, and only data from North America and Europe were used. We found that the probability of demonstrating a positive effect of climate on species differed between regions and between taxonomic classes. The pattern reversed between North America and Europe, leading to a class × continent interaction that was significant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160158F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>): in North America the probability of finding a positive effect of a climatic variable on amphibians was greater than in Europe, whereas in Europe there was a slightly higher likelihood that studies found a positive response from reptiles. In fact, no single study of reptiles in North America predicted a positive outcome for reptiles in response to climate change, and hence no estimate of statistical uncertainty could be calculated. The likelihood that a reviewed study described a negative effect of a climatic variable on a species is the opposite to the likelihood of showing a positive effect, so no results are presented for this view of the data.
