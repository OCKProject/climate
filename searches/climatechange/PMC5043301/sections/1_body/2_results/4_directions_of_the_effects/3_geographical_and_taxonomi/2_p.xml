<p class="p">Geographical bias in the distribution of studies resulted in low sample sizes for several continents, as described above. Thus, we had to restrict the analysis on data from Europe and the Americas to statistically investigate if the probability of an effect of climatic variables on amphibians and reptiles varied among geographical areas. There were insufficient data to estimate probabilities of reporting effects of climate change within South America. For the other regions, the estimated probabilities of reporting climate change effects were over 50%, although the probabilities differed among continents (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS160158TB5" class="xref">table 5</xref>). These differences did not vary among classes as neither the taxonomic class (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.86) nor the continent × class interaction (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.78) were statistically significant. In Europe, about 90% of amphibian and reptilian species were reported to have been affected by climatic variables. In contrast, studies within North and Central America only reported climate change effects in roughly 50% and 65% of the species, respectively (
