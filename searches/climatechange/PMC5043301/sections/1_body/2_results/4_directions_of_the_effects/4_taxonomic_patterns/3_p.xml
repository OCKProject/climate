<p class="p">On average across all families of amphibians examined, the probability of finding a negative effect of climatic variables on population size was much higher than the probability of finding a positive effect (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS160158TB6" class="xref">tableÂ 6</xref>). We found a statistically significant difference among families in the probabilities of reporting negative effects of climate change. However, probabilities of reporting positive effects of climate change did not vary significantly across families.
