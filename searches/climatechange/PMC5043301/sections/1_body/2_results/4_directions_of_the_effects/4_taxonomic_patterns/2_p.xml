<p class="p">The final question that we considered was whether there were differences across families in the rates at which effects of climate change were reported. We limited these analyses to a subset of the data that included only those families for which at least five species were represented, in order to allow for the potential of some variation in response within the families examined. We further restricted our data to studies that looked for effects of climate change on only a single class of responses, changes in population size or occurrence rates, to remove potential biases that could result from differences in the rates at which effects of climate change were reported for studies of different types of responses. Only four additional studies of amphibians would have been added if we had considered all types of responses together. Reports of positive and negative responses to climate change were examined in separate analyses.</p>
