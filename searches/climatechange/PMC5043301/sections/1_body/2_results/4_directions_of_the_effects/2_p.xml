<p class="p">Even after we excluded all studies that forecasted potential future impacts of climate change, we found that a large proportion of studies reported effects of climate change on species. In Europe 20 out of 21 amphibian and four out of five reptilian species were affected by climate change, as well as 26 out of 48 amphibian species and four out of five reptile species in North America. Of the impacted species, 62% of amphibians (56 of 90 species) and 55% of reptiles (six of 11 species) were reported to have been negatively affected, mainly through population declines, reductions in habitat suitability and reduced survival and range sizes. We did not use data from phenological studies in these analyses because they do not directly affect populations.</p>
