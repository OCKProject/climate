<p class="p">Across all types of responses investigated, studies for which the authors collected data in the field were more prevalent than studies that used data from the literature or other databases (60 field versus 44 modelling studies). The numbers of species examined in a study also typically did not vary between field and modelling studies: in both cases, the median number of species per study was 1; 75% quartiles were 3.5 and 3 species for field and modelling studies, respectively. However, studies of change in distribution were almost entirely based on forecasting future distributions from climate envelope models, 22 of 27 studies on distribution change. Changes in the distribution of a species in response to climate change were far more likely to be reported in studies for which climate envelope modelling was used than in studies that obtained data from field observations (
