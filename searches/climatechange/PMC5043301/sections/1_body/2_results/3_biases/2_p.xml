<p class="p">We first investigated five potential biases, because failure to identify biases can influence the interpretation of the results from this review: (i) geographical bias of the locations of the reviewed studies (Wallacean shortfall); (ii) uneven taxonomic representation of the species investigated (Linnean shortfall); (iii) uneven representation of threatened species within the data; (iv) failure to consider alternative explanations for observed responses; and (v) uneven representation of potential responses examined among the studies.</p>
