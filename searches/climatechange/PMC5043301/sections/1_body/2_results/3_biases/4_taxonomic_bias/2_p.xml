 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160158F2" class="xref">2</xref>; electronic supplementary material, table S5). For example, in Europe 43% of all amphibian and 37% of all reptilian species were represented in at least one study. At the same time, Europe harbours only 1.2% and 1.5% of all described amphibian and reptilian species of the world. In contrast, only 1.0% and 0.06% of all South American amphibian and reptilian species were included in the reviewed studies. Together, the species investigated by the reviewed studies belonged to only 32% and 26% of all amphibian and reptilian families.
