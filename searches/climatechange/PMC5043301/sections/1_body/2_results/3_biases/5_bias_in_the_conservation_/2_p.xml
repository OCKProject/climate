<p class="p">Of the 313 species investigated by the reviewed studies, 258 had been assessed by the IUCN Red List and were not ‘data deficient’. Seventeen per cent of those assessed species were categorized as ‘threatened’—15% of the assessed amphibians (26 out of 173 species) and 22% of the assessed reptilians (19 out of 85 species). Considering amphibians (41% classified as threatened;
