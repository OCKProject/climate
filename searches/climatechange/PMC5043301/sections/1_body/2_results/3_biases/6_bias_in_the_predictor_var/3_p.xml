<p class="p">Perhaps surprisingly, the proportion of species for which an effect of a climatic variable was reported did not differ between studies that only investigated climatic factors (proportion = 0.81, 95% CL: 0.73–0.84) and those that included more than one factor in their model (proportion = 0.81, 95% CL: 0.75–0.86). This difference was not statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.55, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 432 species–study combinations, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 104 studies). The listed 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values are the probabilities from logistic regressions testing for differences in the rates of detection of climate effects dependent on whether only climate predictors were considered in the study or not.
