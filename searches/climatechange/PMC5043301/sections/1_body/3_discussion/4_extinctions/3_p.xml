<p class="p">Even though studies have not shown that climate change directly affects species' extinction rates, it is likely that climate change will aggravate other stressors such as disease [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>], habitat change and competition, thus increasing the likelihood of population declines and extinctions. This prediction is especially worrisome, because these stressors are most prevalent in the areas with highest species richness [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], and because extinction risks are concentrated in the areas of highest species diversity [
