<p class="p">Admittedly, the research needed to better anticipate the global impacts of climate change may not be conducive to rapid publication. The deficiencies in information can only be filled by conducting research in less convenient areas, sample sizes would be lower than for studies on common species in easily accessible areas, and resulting papers will be likely to get published in lower-ranking journals.
