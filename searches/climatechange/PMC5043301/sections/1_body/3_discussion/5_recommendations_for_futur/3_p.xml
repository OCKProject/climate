<p class="p">In addition to the need for broader taxonomic and geographical representation, our review identified other weaknesses in the existing information that has been gathered. Mechanistic studies—studies focusing on questions on physiology, reproduction, juvenile recruitment and survival—are rare. In amphibians, it would be important to develop a clearer understanding of the survival probabilities across the entire life cycle, because a different set of factors will be likely to influence each stage [
