<p class="p">The ways in which information is presented should be improved in order to increase the value of individual studies. In the process of collating data for our review, we found that many published studies do not report key information necessary to make them comparable to other studies, information such as effect sizes, power analyses or even just simple information such as the time spans of studies or the exact location(s) of study sites. These omissions of information forced us to restrict ourselves to analyses of presence or absence of reported patterns, whereas ideally we should have compared and contrasted quantitative differences in effects across studies.</p>
