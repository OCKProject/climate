While for career and funding reasons studies over only a few years are forming the vast majority in today's research, these studies are of limited value for the detection of biologically significant long-term trends in distribution, population size or reproduction. Long-term studies require a stable funding of the organizing institution, organized data holding and, in many cases, a close cooperation with educated volunteers (‘citizen scientists' [
