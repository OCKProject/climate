<p class="p">There is a growing number of studies on the impacts of global climate change on species, including amphibians and reptiles [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. This trend has greatly increased our knowledge of the current and potential future impacts of global climate change. Nevertheless, there are many regions, taxa and questions that are currently poorly represented by long-term studies on reptiles and amphibians. Information gaps exist for many regions of the world (especially in Africa, Asia and South America), on many threatened amphibian and reptilian taxa, and on several life-history traits such as reproduction and survival. Given the geographical and taxonomic differences in probabilities of responses to climate change that we found, we believe that it would be unwise to attempt to extrapolate conclusions from well-studied regions and taxa (
