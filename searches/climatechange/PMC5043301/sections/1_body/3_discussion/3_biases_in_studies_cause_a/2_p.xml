<p class="p">We found strong bias in geographical and taxonomic coverage of studies (Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]) and in the questions that were studied. A bias towards northern regions might paint a less negative picture of climate change effects because species in cool areas, especially at the northern range limits, are more likely to benefit from warming. Another issue caused by this geographical bias is that high research intensity is in the areas of low species diversity. Geographical biases in research on amphibians and reptiles have previously been noted in other contexts, including reviews on amphibian ecotoxicology between 1969 and 2004 [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], on the importance of habitat change on amphibians and reptiles [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], on the status of reptiles of the world [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], on the robustness of global amphibian range maps [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] and on studies on biodiversity in general [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Each of these prior reviews recognized the problem of a strong bias towards studies being mainly conducted in North America and Europe.
