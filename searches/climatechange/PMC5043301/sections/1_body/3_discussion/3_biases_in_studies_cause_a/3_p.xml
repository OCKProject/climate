<p class="p">The geographical bias is at least partially responsible for a taxonomic bias in which entire families of amphibians and reptiles, including families with hundreds of species, were not included in the studies we reviewed. Such taxonomic bias is a well-known problem [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Both the geographical and taxonomic bias might result in the investigated species disproportionally representing non-threatened species, because most threatened species occur in small ranges close to or south of the equator (IUCN Red list:
