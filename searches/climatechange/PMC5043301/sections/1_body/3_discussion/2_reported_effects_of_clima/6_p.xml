<p class="p">Potentially, the high probability of reporting effects of climate change based on climate envelope models is misleading because these models are typically based on a simple space-for-time substitution [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Thus, the models assume that current-day spatial variation in climate 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> associated biotic and abiotic environmental features will provide a good indication of all aspects of the environments that species will face in the future when climatic zones have shifted. Climate envelope models can therefore only give a limited view on future effects of climate change if not all aspects of a species' biology, such as dispersal and survival, are taken into account [

 <xref rid="RSOS160158C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Additionally, climate envelope modelling assumes an inability of animals to reduce the negative effect of increased temperatures by seeking out cooler microhabitats. One recent study [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] supports the assumption that behavioural adaptation will be minimal. However, for many species, the detailed information on ecology and life history needed to assess the assumptions of climate envelope models is missing [
