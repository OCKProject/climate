<p class="p">The prevalence of studies that indicate climate effects could be caused by a publication bias towards significant results ([

However, we found that effects of climate change were reported with similar probabilities regardless of whether climate change was the only predictor examined in a study or whether multiple alternative causes of change were examined. We suggest that this finding is an encouraging indication of minimal reporting bias even in studies whose sole intent was to examine climate change as a factor impacting amphibian or reptile populations.
