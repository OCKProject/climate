<p class="p">Nevertheless, the conclusions from climate envelope models may be, in some cases, more reliable than conclusions based entirely on field studies. Current field studies have collected data from relatively short time periods (the average time span of the reviewed studies was 23 years), a time span over which climate change may not have been strong enough to cause a readily detectable effect. Based on the results of climate models, global mean temperature could increase by more than 4Â°C within this century. Modelling studies thus might even paint an optimistic picture if they assume that species only depend on abiotic variables, not taking into account a potential catastrophic disruption in the complex inter-relationships within ecosystems.</p>
