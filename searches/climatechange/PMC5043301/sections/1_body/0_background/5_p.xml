<p class="p">We conducted a systematic review of published studies on amphibians and reptiles to look for evidence both of systematic biases in the types of research being conducted and of patterns of climate change effects. Ectothermic vertebrates are likely to be more directly impacted by climate change than other vertebrates, because their body temperature depends on the surrounding temperatures (but see [

 <xref rid="RSOS160158C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Most amphibians have highly permeable skin, and both aquatic and terrestrial life stages. These attributes make them very sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation. In contrast, reptiles are known to favour warm areas and might therefore be less severely affected by increasing temperatures or may even benefit from global warming.
