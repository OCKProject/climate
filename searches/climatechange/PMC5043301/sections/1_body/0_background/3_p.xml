<p class="p">Within single studies on climate change effects, the picture is even more complex. Generally, studies demonstrate a correlation between a species' trait and a climatic variable. However, such findings cannot determine whether the relationship is causal [

 <xref rid="RSOS160158C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], especially if there is no yardstick against which to measure the observed changes [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Decreases in population size, range size and survival clearly have a negative impact on a species, but this is less clear for observations such as changes in phenology, body size and distribution shifts. The impacts of distribution shifts on species will depend on factors such as habitat connectivity, competition and the availability of habitat and food—which can also be influenced by climate change [
