<p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change will increase mean global temperatures by more than 4°C within this century if we do not reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically and immediately [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Such changes will be likely to have devastating impacts on many species, because the intensity and speed of changes are unprecedented within the last millions of years [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. A clear overview of the impacts of climate change on species is necessary for an informed discussion on the need for emissions reductions to minimize further effects of climate change on species, and on the need for conservation actions to enable species to cope with changing climates. However, demonstrating a direct impact of climate change on a species is extremely difficult because (i) species are influenced by a large array of abiotic and biotic factors [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]; (ii) species differ in their vulnerability to changing climatic conditions, depending on their adaptability, their exposure to climatic extremes and their sensitivity [

 <xref rid="RSOS160158C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; and (iii) climate change can affect species both directly (e.g. by causing heat stress or desiccation) and indirectly (e.g. by influencing disease outbreaks [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] or food availability [
