<p class="p">From each of the reviewed studies, we extracted information on the location (latitude, longitude and elevation) of the study site, the investigated species, the predictor (e.g. climatic data) and response variables (such as population size), and the results (see electronic supplementary material, table S2). Studies were assigned to one of the continents. North America was defined as Canada, the USA and Mexico. Continents and biogeographic realms were essentially identical as geographical units: only one species in Mexico fell into a different set depending on whether continents or biogeographic areas were used to group species. We made the pragmatic decision to group species by continent, because management actions are often based on political and not biogeographic regions. For large-scale studies, we estimated the central location among all study sites and determined latitude and longitude for this central point. Global studies received missing values for the location information. We determined altitude for those studies that gave the exact geographical location. However, that left us with a dataset with many unknown elevation data. Therefore, elevation was not included in the analysis. Species' data included information on taxonomy and conservation status. We standardized all species names to the taxonomic databases of amphibians (AmphibiaWeb [
