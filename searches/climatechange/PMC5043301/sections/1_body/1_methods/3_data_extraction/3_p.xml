<p class="p">In our description of the papers that we reviewed, we categorized the responses examined by researchers into 24 possible types, some of which were rarely investigated; the numbers of studies testing for any given class of response ranged from 1 to 27. The only classes of responses represented in 20 or more studies were: change in phenology (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20), change in population size (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 21), change in occurrence probability (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 25) and change in distribution (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 27). There were insufficient studies examining each of the response classes to allow an examination of patterns within each of the classes of responses separately; we therefore collapsed information from the multiple types of responses into two variables that we used as responses in our analyses: a binary variable (‘SigClimateEffect’ in the archived data) describing whether a statistically significant response to climate change was identified, and a three-category variable (‘CCEffectOnSpecies’) identifying whether effects were positive (1), negative (−1) or not statistically detected (0). Some studies (32 of 109) examined more than one response variable, with the numbers of responses examined ranging from 1 to 4 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 77, 21, 10 and 1 studies with each number of responses, respectively). For studies examining multiple responses, we still condensed the results into a single value of SigClimateEffect and CCEffectOnSpecies. SigClimateEffect was given a value of ‘1’ if any one of the response variables was found to respond to climate change. CCEffectOnSpecies was similarly coded, except for the case in which responses in different directions were reported; in that case we set CCEffectOnSpecies to be a missing value. While this coding enabled us to combine data from studies with a diversity of response variables, any conclusions that we draw are potentially conditional on the mixture of response types that the authors of the reviewed papers chose to study.
