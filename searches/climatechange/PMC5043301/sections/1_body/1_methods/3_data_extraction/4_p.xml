<p class="p">Because of the large variety of predictor variables examined in the reviewed studies, our analyses were based on three broad functional groupings of predictors: (i) climatic variables as described above; (ii) human impact variables (such as habitat destruction, fragmentation, invasive species and pollution); and (iii) other environmental characteristics (such as disease, radiation and vegetation cover). The responses examined by the studies were similarly grouped into functional classes: (i) population size; (ii) distribution; (iii) phenology; (iv) morphology; (v) presence of disease (i.e. Chytridiomycosis); (vi) physiology; and (vii) genetic traits. The electronic supplementary material, table S2 lists the original predictor and response variables, as well as the way in which these were grouped into broader functional categories for analyses.</p>
