<p class="p">Studies that reported a statistically significant relationship between a climate variable and a trait (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were categorized as showing a climate change effect and those with no statistically significant relationships (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were categorized as not showing a climate impact. Ideally, we would have considered the statistical power of the reviewed studies to detect significant relationships. However, this was not possible, because few studies included such estimations of statistical power. We used 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values rather than the sizes of reported effects (i.e. statistical effect sizes) because of the diversity of responses in the reviewed studies (see electronic supplementary material, table S2). Lack of consistency in the types of analyses and results reported further made the use of effect sizes impossible. Preliminary attempts to obtain more detailed statistical data directly from authors were mostly unsuccessful and were therefore not extended to all authors. Thus, our analyses were constrained by the limitations of the available data to using ‘vote counting’ rather than using formal meta-analytic methods [
