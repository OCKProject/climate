<p class="p">The use of vote counting analyses rather than use of formal meta-analyses can be problematic (see chapter 28 of [

Analyses that failed to detect an effect thus need to be interpreted in the light of this fact: failure to detect specific effects of climate change means that such effects either truly do not exist, or were undetected because the effects were too subtle to be statistically detected given the typical effort expended in the studies that we have reviewed. Thus, if anything, our review is under-reporting rates with which climate change has affected species.
