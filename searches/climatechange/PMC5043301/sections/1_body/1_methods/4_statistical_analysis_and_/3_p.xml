<p class="p">We are aware that our approach might bias the results if findings for multiple species within a study were not independent. For example, study methodologies might have widely varying probabilities of detecting true effects of climate change. There are also biologically real reasons for non-independence including: shared geographical location, phylogenetic similarity and same study methods being applied across all of the species investigated. We explicitly tested for the presence of some of these possible biases—geographical differences among broad regions, differences in the response variables examined, taxonomic effects at the level of class and family. However, the quantity and nature of the available data made it impossible to use elegant statistical solutions. Specifically, we could not treat ‘study’ as a statistical random effect, because a large proportion (64%; 67 of 104) of studies reported results only from a single species. In this circumstance, random effects of study cannot be estimated, and mixed models failed to converge to solutions in all of our preliminary trials. We also attempted to control for non-independence with analyses in which the response variable was an odds ratio (i.e. each response was two numbers: the number of species with a response and the number with no response). While in some cases the use of a study-wide odds ratio appeared to function as desired, in most cases, the results—regression coefficients and their standard errors and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values—were identical, regardless of whether each species–study combination or each study was used as a single datum in our analyses. In effect, a 
 <italic class="italic">de facto</italic> conclusion of our study is that future research needs to quantify the manner in which study methodology determines whether a biologically real effect of climate change is identified. Within the context of this study, our conclusions need to be viewed as the most accurate assessment of the existing climate change research on amphibians and reptiles given the diverse and uncoordinated nature of the types of studies conducted within the last decade.
