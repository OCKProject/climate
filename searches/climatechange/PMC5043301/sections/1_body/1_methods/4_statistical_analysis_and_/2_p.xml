<p class="p">All data were analysed using R [
 <xref rid="RSOS160158C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Because of the binary nature of the response variables (electronic supplementary material, table S2), all analyses were done using logistic regressions with the ‘glm’ function within the core ‘stats’ library of R. Probabilities of effects in logistic regressions were calculated using likelihood-ratio tests in the ‘anova.glm’ function associated with ‘glm’. The tests of independence were done using the ‘chisq.test’ function in R's ‘stats’ library, and the chi-squared goodness-of-fit probabilities were calculated manually. The specific predictor variables and forms of all statistical models are described in the Results section. Several species were investigated in more than one study; when this occurred, each species in each separate study was treated as an independent data point. For this reason, sample size in most analyses is higher than the number of species investigated by all studies combined (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 313 species and 464 species–study combinations). About 36% (37 of 104) of the studies that we reviewed reported results for multiple species. Again, for analyses in which species was the unit of response, we treated each species within each study as a separate data point. For other analyses, each study was an independent data point (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 104), and in these cases all studies were treated equally, regardless of the number of species that were investigated by the studies.
