  <p class="p">Variation between Europe and North America, and between classes, in whether effects of climatic variables were assessed as being positive for the species investigated. We included only those species for which the reviewed studies reported a positive or a negative response, excluding those with no or variable responses (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 210). The figure presents results based on the species–study data points, because the results were very similar to the analyses on studies only.
