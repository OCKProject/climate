<p class="p">Can aquatic plants keep pace with climate change? Although this article cannot directly answer this question, I provide arguments, evidence and tools suggesting that many aquatic plants dispersed by migratory birds can potentially expand fast enough to be able to reach suitable habitat in the future. The results from the range shift models show the importance of integrating dispersal capacity with habitat suitability to predict future species distributions. Because LDD accelerates the rate of range shifts, refining estimates of LDD by studying relevant species traits and underlying mechanisms will aid in identifying the species that might keep pace with climate change versus those that might need assistance, for example through conservation plans. Dispersal by migratory birds can be a predictable phenomenon, and thus more reliable predictions of range shifts might be achieved for the many species that may use their services to disperse.</p>
