<p class="p">I modeled range dynamics for three aquatic plant species: fennel pondweed 
 <italic class="italic">Stuckenia pectinata</italic> (L.) Börner, common club-rush 
 <italic class="italic">Schoenoplectus lacustris</italic> (L.) Palla and sea club-rush 
 <italic class="italic">Bolboschoenus maritimus</italic> (L.) Palla. Their initial (present) distributions were obtained from presence records downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and cropped to their European native range, where dispersal data was available (see section Dispersal models). Although GBIF records are probably incomplete and may contain inaccuracies, it should have a minor impact on the broad-scale dynamics modeled here. These species were chosen because there are available data for seed gut retention time and posterior germinability. I used the MigClim modeling platform in R (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engler et al., 2012</xref>) to simulate range shifts according to the dispersal scenarios presented above. As a first step, I estimated a SDM using bioclimatic variables averaged over the past 40 years. Then, using climate projections and published dispersal data, I simulated range shifts for the next 80 years by updating climatic data every 10 years. I performed 10 simulation replicates to control for stochasticity in the dispersal process. Due to their plasticity and adaptability (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santamaría et al., 2003</xref>), I assumed that these species can produce propagules during the first season after colonization, and that in the second year the plants reach full reproductive potential. Detailed methods can be seen in the sections below and the full R code is available in Supplementary Material. The simulations can be fully reproduced using the R code.
