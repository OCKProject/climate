<p class="p">The distribution and community structure of aquatic plant species are strongly determined by climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, and their top-down effects on habitats at the landscape and local scales (

Although climate projections are calibrated mainly for atmospheric conditions, a high proportion of water availability depends on precipitation regimes. Moreover, air temperature was found to be correlated with water temperature across the globe (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, I used commonly used bioclimatic variables to model species distributions. Note, however, that the objective was to assess the role of bird-mediated dispersal on the rate of expansion, and not to accurately predict species distributions.
