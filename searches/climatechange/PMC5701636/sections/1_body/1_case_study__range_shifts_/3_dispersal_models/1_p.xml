<p class="p">Seed dispersal for the three aquatic plant species was mediated by mallards (
 <italic class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</italic>) and teals (
 <italic class="italic">A. crecca</italic>), two abundant waterfowl species that migrate each year across Europe. Dispersal kernels were estimated by combining movement distances with gut retention times according to a procedure described in 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al. (2013)</xref>. I estimated for each aquatic plant species a local dispersal kernel (&lt;100 km) and a full LDD kernel using the appropriate movement distance parameters obtained from the same publication. These parameters were based on empirical data, providing a more realistic set for the range dynamics simulation. It is worth noting that allometric scaling can be used to derive dispersal kernels for other migratory bird vectors and other aquatic seeds to further explore the responses of aquatic vegetation to climate change (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The difference between local and migratory dispersal kernels lay in the maximum distances (100 km for local distances, and from 500 km to &gt;1000 km for migratory distances, depending on the species;
