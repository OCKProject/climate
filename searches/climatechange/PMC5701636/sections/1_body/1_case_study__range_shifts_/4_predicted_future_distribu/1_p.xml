<p class="p">Habitat suitability in original occurrence areas was reduced by climate change, resulting in the contraction of the distributions of all species when they could not disperse. However, when species were allowed to disperse, their distribution ranges expanded to areas where climate became suitable (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The rate of expansion differed according to the dispersal scenario (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). When dispersal vectors were allowed to move only over local distances (&lt;100 km), colonization rates ranged from 3.3 to 8.0 km⋅year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, but when migratory movements were included in the dispersal kernels (full LDD), expansion rates ranged from 12.1 to 31.5 km⋅year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (as calculated by the squared root of the average annual colonized area). In both cases, the colonization rates were higher than the local extinction rates, resulting in net range expansion for all species (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). For all but one species, the distribution ranges eventually reached virtually all the available area after 20–40 years, showing the power of full LDD in promoting range expansion. For the pondweed 
 <italic class="italic">Stuckenia pectinata</italic>, however, the colonization rate was lower, and so was the rate of convergence between habitat availability and species distribution, as this species shows relatively shorter seed retention times in the birds’ body and thus lower frequency of LDD &gt; 100 km (

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
