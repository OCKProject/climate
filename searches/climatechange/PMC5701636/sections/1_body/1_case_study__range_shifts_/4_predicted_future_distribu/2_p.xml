<p class="p">The estimated rates of colonization should be sufficient to allow species to track climate suitability. For example, global temperature is predicted to be increasing at a mean velocity of 0.42 km⋅year

Altogether these results suggest that quantifying the dispersal capacity may be critical for predicting the likelihood of species to adjust their ranges under the relatively high rate of climate change. Studying the mechanisms underlying long distance seed dispersal is one possible approach (
