<p class="p">The results from this simulation model show the importance of studying and estimating dispersal potential to predict which species will be able to migrate without further assistance. In aquatic ecosystems, aquatic plants that produce seeds that can survive transportation by waterbirds are good candidates to keep pace with climate change, especially if their seeds form abundant banks in the sediment where many waterbirds species feed on. This maximizes the possibility of both ingestion and consequent endozoochory, and attachment to the birdsâ€™ body and consequent ectozoochory. For other plants and organisms, traits such as fruiting during bird migration seasons, evolvability of dispersal capacity at the range front, body size in animals, among others can favor the likelihood of LDD (
