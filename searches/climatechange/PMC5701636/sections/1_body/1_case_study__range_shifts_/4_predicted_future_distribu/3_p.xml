<p class="p">For the studied aquatic plants, the traits that allow for such dispersal capacities are related to seed characteristics, as well as the phenology of seed production and formation of propagule banks, that might maximize the probability of encounter with dispersal vectors (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al., 2016</xref>). In other taxa, e.g., whose seeds are dispersed by water or wind, or birds with a lower movement capacity, the ability to keep pace with climate change might be reduced (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>). However, many studies have concluded that seed dispersal estimates are not sufficient to explain the faster-than-expected plant migration rates estimated from historical records – as illustrated by the Reid’s paradox (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clark et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, seed dispersal in general has been estimated to occur within 10–1500 m (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corlett and Westcott, 2013</xref>), which might be insufficient to explain both post-glacial migration rates (e.g., estimates for trees range from 0.06 to 0.5 km⋅year

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feurdean et al., 2013</xref>) and current latitudinal shifts of terrestrial species, including plants, estimated to be occurring at a median rate of 1.7 km⋅year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, evidence suggests that organisms in general have higher dispersal capacities than usually estimated. This might be due to the fact that LDD events (e.g., beyond 1.5 km) are difficult to quantify and often underestimated in dispersal models.
