<p class="p">Many species might have dispersal capacities that allow them to adjust their ranges under current and future rates of climate change, namely those that have a means to engage in long distance dispersal (LDD) (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engler and Guisan, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corlett and Westcott, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al., 2016</xref>). This has been increasingly recognized, and recent platforms for modeling species distributions have included dispersal as a core process in species range shifts (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zurell et al., 2016</xref>). LDD is defined here as dispersal beyond both the genetic neighborhood and population boundaries (i.e., strict-sense LDD; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jordano, 2017</xref>). However, only a very low proportion of studies on changes in species distributions, and thus of modeled species, incorporated dispersal data into their models (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bateman et al., 2013</xref>). This is precluding our ability to more realistically understand whether species will be able to keep pace with climate change and occupy suitable habitat in the future (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thuiller et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bateman et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hellmann et al., 2016</xref>). Which species have this capacity is thus an important question, though it remains largely unexplored.
