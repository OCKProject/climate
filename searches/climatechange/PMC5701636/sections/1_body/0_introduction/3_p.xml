<p class="p">In the aquatic realm, dispersal is even a more determinant factor due to the patchy nature of inland aquatic ecosystems (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bush and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). Aquatic plants, but also other aquatic organisms such as algae and invertebrates, are able to disperse overland through dispersal of seeds and other propagules by birds (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al., 2016</xref>). Evidence for seed dispersal by migratory birds comes from waterbird diet studies, which showed that a great diversity of waterbird species consume and deposit large amounts of a variety of seed species (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Leeuwen et al., 2012</xref>); and from mechanistic dispersal models that combine waterbird movements and seed retention times in or on the birds’ body (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kleyheeg et al., 2017</xref>). This dispersal capacity concur with the generally broad distributional ranges of aquatic plants (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santamaría, 2002</xref>), and with gene flow occurring over large scales (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">King et al., 2002</xref>). Although many factors might reduce seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE), such as phenological mismatches between migration and seed production, unidirectionality during bird migration, and the unsuitability of arrival habitats (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clausen et al., 2002</xref>), all the latter studies support that waterbirds are effective dispersers of aquatic plant seeds. There is accumulating evidence for both the quantity and quality of seed dispersal that suggests high SDE, namely the large amounts of seeds dispersed (an average of 45% of sampled waterbird droppings contain seeds) that remain viable following transportation (36% on average; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Leeuwen et al., 2012</xref>). For a more profound review of SDE, see
