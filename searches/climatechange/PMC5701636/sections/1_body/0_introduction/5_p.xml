<p class="p">Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used as forecasting tools (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guisan et al., 2013</xref>). These models allow to relating past and present climatic conditions to the presence-absence of species, and predict their potential presence for a projected climate scenario. However, these models often assume a scenario of either none or unlimited dispersal, and thus the probable future distribution will lie somewhere between these two extreme scenarios (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bateman et al., 2013</xref>). To exemplify and investigate whether aquatic plants will keep pace with climate change, I followed the basic framework presented in 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Viana et al. (2016)</xref>, implemented using the MigClim model (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engler et al., 2012</xref>), to compare different dispersal scenarios in three aquatic plant species: (1) no dispersal, (2) seed dispersal by local bird movements (&lt;100 km; hereafter “local dispersal”), (3) seed dispersal by local and migratory bird movements (hereafter “full LDD”), and (4) unlimited dispersal. The latter corresponds to a situation in which the species would fully track available habitat.
