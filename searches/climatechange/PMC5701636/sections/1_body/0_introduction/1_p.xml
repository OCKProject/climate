<p class="p">The rate at which climate is changing might preclude many species from adapting to novel conditions or moving to other areas where environmental conditions become suitable (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parmesan, 2006</xref>). Thus, whether species will be able to keep pace with climate change and ultimately persist is an urgent and crucial question in ecology, evolution and conservation science. Evidence already suggests that many species can adjust their geographic ranges in response to climate change (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lenoir and Svenning, 2015</xref>). However, the lack of knowledge and integration of dispersal for most species is hampering a general assessment of the potential of species to track climate change (
