<p class="p">There is an extensive literature on SDMs, and one of their main limitations is the characterization of the species’ niche, in particular when predicting range shifts based on climate change. The model presented here only accounted for climatic variables and presence of water, though it is known that many other local habitat variables are important to explain species presence, such as water chemistry. Some parameters related to water chemistry, such as nutrient concentrations (e.g., phosphorus), might even be influenced by climatic variables (e.g.,

Another line of evidence comes from a recent study showing that the niche of aquatic plants is not conserved among different regions (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alahuhta et al., 2017</xref>). Although this might imply that assumptions regarding habitat suitability can be relaxed, it also affects the estimation of SDMs, whose predictions can be less generalized across increasing spatial scales. Thus regional idiosyncrasy in species niches should be probably taken into account when modeling species distributions.
