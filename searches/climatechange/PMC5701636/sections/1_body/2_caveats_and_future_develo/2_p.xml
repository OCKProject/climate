<p class="p">Another important, but often neglected, factor when predicting range shifts is the directionality of dispersal. Because climate change is in itself directional, since change is more pronounced across latitude than across longitude, if the direction of dispersal is not coincident with that of climate change, the ability to expand or shift might be decoupled. Birds mostly migrate along a latitudinal gradient twice a year, by moving to northern latitudes during the spring migration and to southern latitudes during the autumn migration. However, these movements occur along preferential migration routes that might not, or only partially, overlap with suitable habitat for plants, and thus it is important to incorporate movement direction into range shift models. Adding this feature to modeling platforms such as MigClim (see also 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zurell et al., 2016</xref>) would thus be a useful tool for many species with directional LDD, including species dispersed by wind, water and animals, as well as vagile organisms such as migratory animals (

Moreover, climate change might affect bird future distributions, migratory movements and physiology, and lead to changes in seed dispersal. It will be important to assess to what extent the effects of climate change on seed dispersal will affect the ability of aquatic plants to migrate and adjust their ranges.
