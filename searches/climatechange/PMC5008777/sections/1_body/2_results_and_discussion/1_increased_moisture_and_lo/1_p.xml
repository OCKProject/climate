<p class="p">Climate change was expected to result in wetter soils with lower O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> relative to PC in all three STAs. Water-filled pore space (WFPS) increased under CC for conventional and shallow narrow STAs at all depths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Values of WFPS for P&amp;S ranged from 3%-11% under PC and increased to 10%-47% under CC, whereas WFPS increased from 5%-23% to 16%-29% in the shallow narrow STAs under CC. The concentration of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in soil pores was lower under CC relative to PC at all depths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Less O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and higher WFPS in the STA can have a number of consequences for contaminant removal processes, discussed below.
