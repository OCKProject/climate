<p class="p">To compare the performance of the treatment trains that include conventional and shallow narrow STAs under PC and CC, we estimated contaminant removal over the course of a year (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162104.s001" class="xref">S1</xref>). We used mean values for contaminant concentrations in input water (
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and, for treatment trains including SND and GEO, assumed that contaminant removal rates in the sand filter did not change with climate change. At the system scale, more BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> was released from a treatment train with a conventional STA than from treatment trains with shallow narrow STAs under both climate conditions, likely due to sand filter pre-treatment. A greater number of FCB were present in output water from systems with a shallow narrow STAs than a system with a conventional STA under CC conditions, whereas complete FCB removal was observed under PC in all three systems. A higher mass of total P was released from treatment trains with a conventional STA than from treatment trains with shallow narrow STAs under both climate conditions. A greater mass of total N was present in output water from systems with a conventional STA under PC, however, more total N was present in output water from systems with shallow narrow STAs under CC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). Because the shallow narrow systems are not designed to enhance N removal, use of alternative OWTS with advanced N removal components should improve N removal rates regardless of climate conditions.
