<p class="p">No FCB were detected in output water under PC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). In contrast, FCB was detected in output water from all three STA types under CC, with maximum concentrations of 17, 6, and 20 CFU 100 mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for P&amp;S, SND and GEO, respectively. Median output water concentrations were 0.0 CFU 100 mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for P&amp;S and GEO, and 0.1 CFU 100 mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for SND. Differences were not statistically significant between climate conditions (p = 0.106) or among STA types (p = 0.696). The presence of FCB in output water was more variable under CC for all STA types, with greater variability observed in SND and GEO (
