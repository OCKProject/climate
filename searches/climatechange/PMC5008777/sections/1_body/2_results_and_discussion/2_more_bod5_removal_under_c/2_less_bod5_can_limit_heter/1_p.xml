<p class="p">Our results generally support the hypothesis that BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> removal may increase under CC. Soil microbial communities are carbon limited [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> is expected to be well removed in the STA. Decomposition of organic carbon in soil is dependent on soil moisture content and temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Because both soil moisture and temperature increased with CC, we cannot ascertain the contribution of each variable to increased BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> removal. Greater removal of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) under CC in SND and GEO may have limited heterotrophic processes in the STA, such as denitrification, as discussed below.
