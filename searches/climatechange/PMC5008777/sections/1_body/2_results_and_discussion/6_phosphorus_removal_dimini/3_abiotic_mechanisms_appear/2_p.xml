<p class="p">Our results suggest that the concentration of total P in output water from the STA may increase under CC. The resulting higher levels of total P in groundwater can eventually lead to increased eutrophication of freshwater bodies. In addition to the detrimental effects of eutrophication on aquatic organisms, it may also lead to public health concerns related to production of trihalomethanes (THM), carcinogenic compounds produced from chlorination of drinking water with a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon [
