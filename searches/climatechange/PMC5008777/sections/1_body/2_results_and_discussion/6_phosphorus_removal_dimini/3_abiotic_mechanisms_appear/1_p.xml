<p class="p">To differentiate between potential abiotic mechanisms affecting P removal, we plotted the concentration of dissolved Fe, Mn and Al in output water versus the concentration of total P for all three STA types under PC and CCe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The closer the slope of the line of metal concentration vs. P in solution is to 1 (indicating stronger coupling)–which describes the stoichiometry of the metal-P complexes–the more likely it is that P was released from complexes formed with that metal. Under PC, the slope of the line for all three metals is considerably less than 1, indicating that dissolution of metal-P complexes was not responsible for release of total P to output water (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). In contrast, under CC the slope of the line for Fe and Mn is much closer to 1, suggesting that reduction of these metals became more important for total P release under CC. Because Al and total P in output water were not strongly coupled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>), it appears that climate change did not influence this mechanism.
