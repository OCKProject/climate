<p class="p">Our results support the hypothesis that total P removal may diminish under CC for all STA types. The mechanism for this effect may involve lower availability of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the STA under climate change. Limited O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> availability likely lead to microbial reduction and increased solubility of redox-active metals (Fe and Mn) in soil involved in forming insoluble precipitates with phosphate. Along with formation of precipitates with Al oxides, this is thought to be the primary mechanism for total P removal in the STA [

 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Reduction of Fe and Mn increases their solubility, which not only releases phosphate bound to Fe and Mn oxides into the dissolved phase, but also results in a decrease in the number of metal oxide sites available for reaction with–and retention–of phosphorus. Dissolution of Al at the acidic pH found in the STA (&lt; 3.5) may have also contributed to P leaching [
