<p class="p">Median total P removal under PC was close to 100% for SND and GEO, and declined to 71% for SND and 72% for GEO under CC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Median total P removal in P&amp;S also declined, from 75% under PC to 66% under CC. The differences in total P removal between climate conditions were significant (p = &lt;0.001), as were differences in removal among STA types (p = 0.004). Pairwise comparisons of means between STA types indicated that P&amp;S was significantly different from SND or GEO; however, SND and GEO did not have different removal. As was the case for removal of other wastewater constituents, we observed higher variability in total P removal under CC than under PC in all STA types (
