<p class="p">Our results suggest that CC may increase inputs of N to ground water from shallow narrow STAs. Higher inputs of N to groundwater under CC increases the probability of affecting ecosystem and public health. Eutrophication from excessive inputs of N to saline water bodies may lead to hypoxia and anoxia when microorganisms decompose plant material after death, killing fish and other aerobic organisms. High levels of NO
