<p class="p">In a model simulation of N removal in our STA mesocosms, Morales et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] predicted increased N removal at 23°C (in comparison to 20°C) under PC depth to the water table, and higher N removal as the water table was elevated. The poor agreement between the modeled simulation and experimental results suggests that additional parameters affected by CC, such as higher consumption of organic C, need to be incorporated in the model.
