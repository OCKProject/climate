 </sub> is lower for SND and GEO, and higher for P&amp;S under CC relative to PC, reflecting differences in the reaction rates between climate conditions, since we assumed the velocity of water remains the same under both climate regimes. Our results suggest that the movement of water through the STA may be too rapid for substantial denitrification to take place, regardless of STA type and climate conditions (
