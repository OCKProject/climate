<p class="p">The median total N removal was lower under CC for SND and GEO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), decreasing from 6% to -11% in SND and from 7% to 3% in GEO, resulting in a net increase in total N concentration in output water relative to PC conditions. In contrast, the median total N removal for P&amp;S increased, from 14% under PC to 19%, under CC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The differences in total N removal between climate conditions were not significant (p = 0.171), although differences in removal among STA types were (p = 0.008). Pairwise comparisons of means between STA types indicated that P&amp;S was significantly different from SND or GEO; however, there was no significant difference in N removal between SND and GEO. Total N removal was more variable under CC for all STA types, which likely contributed to the absence of a statistically significant effect of climate conditions. There were more events of no net change in N concentration or net increase in total N concentration in output water under CC (data not shown). Under PC, 25% (SND) and 100% (GEO and P&amp;S) of the observations reflected net removal of total N. However, 27% (SND) and only 63% (GEO and P&amp;S) of CC observations resulted in net removal of total N. Although the frequency of total N leaching events in SND were similar between climate conditions, the concentration N in the output water was higher under CC.
