<p class="p">The leaching of total N in excess of inputs may be due to an increase in the frequency of N cycling. In a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], we presented evidence of internal recycling of N through uptake and re-mineralization of microbial biomass N. Establishment of climate change conditions, and more frequent incidents of water table perching [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] in SND and GEO, may have caused the rate of internal N recycling to increase, increasing the probability that sampling occurred when net leaching of N to output water took place.
