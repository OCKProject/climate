<p class="p">The absence of differences in virus removal between climate conditions and among STA types suggests a common mechanism for viral removal and inactivation under all of these conditions. Viral particles develop a positive charge at pH values below their isoelectric point (pI). The pI of most bacteriophage and animal viruses is &lt; 7.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], and the pH of the soil in the STAs was &lt; 3.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], suggesting that viruses are likely retained on the negatively-charged soil surfaces. This ionic interaction is probably more important than the effects of temperature or soil moisture on the fate and transport of viruses in these STA types.
