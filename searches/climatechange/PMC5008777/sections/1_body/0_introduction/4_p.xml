<p class="p">Elevated temperatures due to climate change may also affect contaminant removal in the STA. Atmospheric temperature is expected to increase 3–5 °C in the next 100 years in the Northeastern U.S, warming the soil profile [

 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Microbial activity increases with warmer temperatures, which may enhance removal of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5,</sub> however, lower levels of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> may limit heterotrophic processes such as N removal by denitrification. Higher temperatures will also reduce O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solubility and increase microbial O

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can lead to low redox conditions, resulting in metal reduction and a diminished P removal capacity of soil.
