<p class="p">The soil treatment area (STA; also known as a drainfield or leachfield) of an onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) is an important component for removal of contaminants from wastewater. Treatment takes place as wastewater percolates through the unsaturated portion of the soil profile, where low moisture and high oxygen (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) levels are conducive to removal of pathogens, and where chemical and microbial processes can reduce the concentration of other contaminants. The extent of treatment in the STA depends on soil texture, residence time, and the volume of unsaturated soil the wastewater passes through, represented by the vertical separation between the infiltrative surface of the STA and the water table [
