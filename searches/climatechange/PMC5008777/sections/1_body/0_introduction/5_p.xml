<p class="p">In a conventional OWTS, solids are removed from wastewater by sedimentation in the septic tank, and septic tank effluent (STE) is dispersed to the STA for final treatment. The STA in a conventional OWTS is located deep in the soil profile–generally in the C horizon–where infiltration of STE into coarser textured soil with larger pores reduces the likelihood of hydraulic failure due to clogging. Shallow narrow drainfields, an alternative type of STA used with advanced wastewater treatment systems (designed to reduce waste strength, not designed to remove N), may be more resilient to climate change effects than conventional STAs. A shallow narrow STA receives effluent that has undergone secondary treatment in an advanced treatment component, resulting in higher dissolved oxygen levels, and reduced levels of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and particulates in effluent prior to STA dispersal. The secondary treatment lowers the probability of hydraulic failure due to clogging of soil pore spaces, and allows the infiltrative surface to be placed higher in the soil profile than in a conventional STA. Shallower dosing affords a greater volume of unsaturated soil for treatment, and may provide better oxygenation, as well as enhanced filtration of wastewater through finer soil particles in the upper portion of the soil profile. In addition, shallow narrow STA designs incorporate frequent timed-dosing of small volumes of wastewater, preventing prolonged periods of soil saturation, which are common in a conventional STA. Together, these factors may make shallow narrow STAs more resilient to climate change than conventional STAs.
