<p class="p">In a previous study we compared the water quality functions of conventional and shallow narrow STAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. We observed complete removal of fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), bacteriophage (a human virus surrogate) and total P, and near complete removal of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> in conventional and shallow narrow STAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Although limited, removal of total N was higher in the conventional STA [
 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that climate change (higher shallower water table and increased temperature) would diminish removal of FCB, viral surrogates, and total P in conventional and shallow narrow STAs, whereas removal of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and total N would be marginally improved. We expected the shallow narrow STAs to have comparatively better contaminant removal than conventional STAs because the former have a larger volume of soil for treatment. We evaluated these hypotheses in a laboratory experiment using triplicate intact soil mesocosms representing a conventional STA and two types of shallow narrow STAs. We compared the water quality functions of the STAs under present climate (PC) (20°C; vertical separation distance representative of regulatory values), and moderate 100-year predicted climate change (CC) (25°C; vertical separation distance reduced by 30 cm by raising the water table elevation) conditions. These conditions are generally representative of the expected climate changes in the glaciated Northeastern U.S.
