<p class="p">Intact soil cores were collected in PVC pipes (152-cm tall x 15-cm-diam.), and excavated in October 2012 from a 5-m long trench containing Bridgehampton silt loam soil (Coarse-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrudepts) in Kingston, Rhode Island, USA. Bottom edges of PVC pipes were sanded until sharp to minimize soil compaction and gradual pressure was applied to the top with an excavator until desired core depth was achieved. Intact cores were transported to the laboratory (&lt; 1 mile) in a flat-bed truck and engineered to represent one of three drainfield types in the laboratory:(i) conventional pipe and stone (P&amp;S), (ii) shallow narrow drainfield (SND), and (iii) GeomatÂ® (GEO), a SND variation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162104.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), at 25 cm for GEO, and at 84 cm for P&amp;S. Briefly, dosers were designed to replicate technology designs with sheet flow inside an upside down, halved 10-cm-diam. PVC dome for SND, diffused flow from a 2.5-cm-diam. PVC pipe through fused plastic filament mesh and geotextile filter fabric for GEO, and massive flow from a 10-cm-diam. PVC pipe placed between layers of stone for P&amp;S. Mixed A and B horizon topsoil covered dosers to previous soil surface level as per in-field practices (
