<p class="p">The mesocosms were maintained at 20.0 ± 0.7°C under PC conditions, and the temperature increased to 25.0 ± 0.7°C to simulate CC. This was accomplished by covering the outside of the mesocosms with heavy-duty aluminum foil (to increase heat diffusion), wrapping 115V heating cables (Hydrokable, Sacramento, CA) around the mesocosms, and wrapping reflective double bubble foil insulation material around the mesocosms. A thermostat (NEMA 4X, Aqua Logic, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to regulate the temperature, and soil temperature was measured using iButton sensors (DS1921G, Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA) buried 5 cm below the soil surface. Ceramic-tipped probes (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) were used to measure soil temperature at depths of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 cm below the infiltrative surface for SND and GEO, and at 0 and 15 cm below the infiltrative surface for P&amp;S (
