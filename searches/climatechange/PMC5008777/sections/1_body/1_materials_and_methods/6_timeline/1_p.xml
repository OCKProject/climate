<p class="p">Mesocosms were prepared by initially filling with tap water from the bottom, and dosed with tap water at steady flow rates for 75 days. They were allowed to drain by gravity for two days before introduction of wastewater. The mesocosms received wastewater for 24 months prior to this experiment. The data representing PC in this study was collected for four months (July–Oct., 2014) prior to implementation of CC conditions. Climate change data was collected after the STAs had equilibrated, approximately four months after the change in climate conditions (Feb.–July, 2015). We estimated the time required for equilibration of STAs based on the time for recovery of water quality functions following environmental disturbances reported in [
