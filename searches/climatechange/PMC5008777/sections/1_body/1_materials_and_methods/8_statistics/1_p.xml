<p class="p">A non-parametric two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in removal of BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, FCB, total P, and total N as a function of STA type and climate conditions using untransformed data, except for total P, which was transformed using a 1/(n) transform. Means separation was accomplished using the Holm-Sidak method. A t-test was used to evaluate differences in input wastewater characteristics for STE and SFE between climate conditions. All statistical tests were performed on averaged replicate data by sampling date collected over four months, and evaluated at p â‰¤ 0.05.
