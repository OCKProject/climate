 <xref rid="pone.0162104.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. To simulate climate change (CC), the water table was raised 30 cm, resulting in a separation distance of 72 cm for SND and GEO, and 26 cm for P&amp;S. Soil EC-5 moisture probes and Em5b data loggers (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) were used to measure soil moisture every 15 minutes at depths of 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 cm below the infiltrative surface for SND and GEO, and at 15 and 30 cm below the infiltrative surface for P&amp;S (
