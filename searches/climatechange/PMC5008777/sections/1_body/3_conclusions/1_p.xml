<p class="p">Our results indicate that CC can affect contaminant removal, with effects dependent on the contaminant and STA type. Removal of FCB, total P and total N in shallow narrow STAs diminished under CC conditions. In contrast, total N removal in conventional STAs improved. Viral pathogens and BOD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> were well removed under PC and CC, suggesting that OWTS were more resilient with respect to these contaminants.
