<p class="p">The response of abiotic and biotic components in OWTS to differing temperature and moisture conditions may be different. For example, the rate of soil microbial processes is known to double with a 10Â°C increase in temperature [

This study provides regulators with a starting point for future planning as well as providing an impetus for designing improvements for OWTS technologies.
