   <bold class="bold">(A) Schematic diagram of soil mesocosms representing a shallow narrow drainfield (SND), GeoMat
    <sup class="sup">Â®</sup> (GEO), and pipe and stone (P&amp;S) soil treatment areas (STAs).
   </bold> The wastewater input to SND and GEO was sand filter effluent (SFE), whereas the P&amp;S received septic tank effluent (STE). The approximate location of soil horizons, ports for gas sampling, and moisture and temperature probes are indicated. Water exits the mesocosms through a hanging water column device used to adjust the height of the water table. The atmosphere in the infiltrative area is connected to a 30-cm soil column. 
   <bold class="bold">(B) Detailed schematic diagram of the SND, GEO and P&amp;S delivery devices.</bold> Diagrams are not to scale. Heating cables were wrapped around mesocosms, covered with insulation, and connected to a digital thermostat to control soil temperature.
