<p class="p">Phylogeographic analyses at regional scales have started to appear during the past few years, revealing a strong effect of palaeogeographic history of current distribution of isopod taxa (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santamaria et al. 2013</xref>). There are still just a few such analyses so far, but we should expect a rapid raise of their publication rates given the modern advances in molecular techniques.
