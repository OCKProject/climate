<p class="p">At a larger scale, dispersal of isopods may be constrained by climatic and edaphic factors. Annual temperature, amount of daylight and precipitation regimes may condition the existence, dispersal, and activity of isopods. For example, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuznetsova and Gongalsky (2012)</xref> found that woodlice distribution in the former USSR is thus severely constrained by the isotherm of &gt; 10 Â°C for at least 120 days per year, beyond which no isopod species could be found (Fig.
