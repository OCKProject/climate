  <p class="p">Aggreg = aggregation level; Abund = prey abundance level; Dist = Distance to the resource; Length = female body length; Mem = type of memory. (X
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>, Y
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>) = location of the female in the current time. Abund (X
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>,Y
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>) = prey abundance at (X
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>, Y
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub>) coordinate. Rep = number of the current seal replication. t = time step; t
   <sub class="sub">suckling</sub> = time the female has spent to suckle the pup; ts = time the female has already spent at sea during the current trip; E
   <sub class="sub">seal</sub> = current energy of the female seal; E
   <sub class="sub">init</sub> = current initial energy of the female seal; E
   <sub class="sub">pup</sub> = current energy of the pup; D
   <sub class="sub">island</sub> = distance separating the female from the island (indirectly the time needed to go back to the island). The purple box corresponds to the periods the female is ashore. The blue boxes correspond to the submodels.
