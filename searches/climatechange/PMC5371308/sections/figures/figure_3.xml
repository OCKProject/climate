  <title class="title">Effects of distance to the resource (Dist) on foraging behavior parameters.</title>
  <p class="p">Effects (mean Â± SD) of distance to the resource on (a) the probability of pups death (filled circles) and females death (open circles) (n = 4800 in each case), (b) the fishing events number (NbrFishing, open circles) and the trips number (NbrTrip, filled circles) (n = 4800) and (c) the average energy gained by females by trip (n = 1598). Parameters used: Aggreg = 3, Abund = intermediate level, female body length = 115 cm and type of memorization = Mem1. The black line represents the linear regression with R
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.93. For both (b) and (c) only females that successfully breed their pup were considered.
