  <title class="title">Effect of aggregation level of food resources.</title>
  <p class="p">Effect (mean ± SD) of resource aggregation and abundance level on the probability of (a) pups and (b) females death: low (red circles), intermediate (green triangles), high (purple squares) and very high abundance (blue diamonds); n = 1350 in each case. (c) Mean (± SD) of the success of female-pup pairs (SP) as a function of the level of resource aggregation. (d) Effect (mean ± SD) of the aggregation level of the prey on the mean distance travelled by trips (MeanDTrip). (e) Effect (mean ± SD) of the aggregation level of the prey on the number of fishing events per trip (NbrFishing/NbrTrip). For both (d) and (e) we considered only females that successfully completed their rearing period.</p>
