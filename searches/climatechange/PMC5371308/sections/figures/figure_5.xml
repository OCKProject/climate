  <title class="title">Distribution and frequency of fishing events.</title>
  <p class="p">Simulation results for 115 cm female body length in an environment roughly corresponding to that of the Kerguelen archipelago (intermediate abundance = 180 g of catchable prey per hour, Aggreg = 3 and Dist = 150 km). The red star identifies the location of the islands; the two white circles define the limits of the island plateau and the distance (Dist) to the resource, respectively. (a) Localization of the fishing events of 10 females over the rearing period (small white circles) on the map of resource density. (b) Location and frequency of the fishing events of 50 females over the rearing period in the same environment. One can see that the most frequently fished cells (b) mainly correspond to the richest ones (a). Conversely, a lot of poor cells have been visited in which animals have been fishing. However, these cells show low fishing frequencies indicating that animals are likely to spend less time in poor-quality zones.</p>
