<p class="p">Future studies should also consider the effect of the vertical accessibility and structuring of the prey on the reproductive success of females, as a function of their length. In this line, the work of Benoit-Bird [

 <italic class="italic">Callorhinus ursinus</italic>)) revealed that the “fine scale distribution of prey is critical to how predators perceive the suitability of their food supply and the mechanisms they use to exploit it”. In particular, the quality of the patches of juvenile Pollock on which Northern fur seals feed, their structuring into clusters and inter-patch distance, were found to play major roles. In order to obtain more detailed and accurate results, we have already engaged in coupling MarCPFS with a physical-biogeochemical model of the ocean dynamics (including the micronekton dynamics: SEAPODYM, [
 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]). This coupling, after modifications and new calibration of our model, should allow us to verify that some of the prominent results we presented can be, to some extent, generalized to other central place foragers such as seabirds.
