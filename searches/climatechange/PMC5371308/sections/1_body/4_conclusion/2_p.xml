<p class="p">Body length appears to be a good example of an integrative trait [

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. It is known to be highly heritable in most animal species [
 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] and thus most likely under strong natural selection in the wild. Hence, we can hypothesize that analogous changes in the environment would lead to a gradual selection of larger individuals, although female length may not evolve quickly enough to compensate for the rate of change in the distance to resource parameter. This will depend on the adequacy of velocities of the southward shift of the main oceanographic frontal structures and evolution of the populations with regards to global warming.
