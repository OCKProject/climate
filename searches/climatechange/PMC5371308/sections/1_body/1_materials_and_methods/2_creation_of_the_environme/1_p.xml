<p class="p">The first step consisted in creating artificial maps of resources in which females will move. The map, static over time, representing the environment is a 100 × 100 matrix. Each cell corresponds to a 10 × 10 km area and the island is set at the center of the map. According to Guinet

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] females were found to forage up to 547 km away from the island, with a mean distance of 160 km. We therefore distributed the food resources around the islands within a 500 km radius circle. Female fur seals start foraging extensively beyond the Kerguelen plateau edge [15, 24 and 28]. Moreover, recent works have showed that there are few fishing attempts over the Kerguelen plateau compared to the pelagic zone, suggesting that the plateau is an unsuitable foraging area (40; M. Viviant unpublished data). The first step of the map creation involved computing the Euclidean distance of each cell to the island. Then, all cells more than 500 km away or within the 50 km wide Kerguelen plateau were set to zero abundance. The distance to resources (Dist) represents the inner limit of the highest possible abundance so that there is a gradient of probability (from 0.0 to 1.0) from the edge of the plateau to this limit (

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]). To this end, for each map the parameter "scale" of GaussRF defined an aggregation level. We defined eight arbitrary levels of prey aggregation (Aggreg) from dispersed to highly aggregated (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173797.s003" class="xref">S1C Fig</xref>). For a defined quantity of resource, the lowest level of aggregation (level 0) represents more than 500 patches of about 1.5 cells. The highest level of aggregation (level 10) corresponds to an average of 10 patches of about 67.4 cells. Then, after normalization, a multiplicative coefficient was assigned to each map corresponding to its total abundance level. We defined four levels of abundance (Abund): low, intermediate, high and very high which correspond to average fishing success of approximately 90, 180, 270 and 360 g per hour, respectively.
