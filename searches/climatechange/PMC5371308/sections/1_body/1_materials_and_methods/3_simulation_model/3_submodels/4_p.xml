 <bold class="bold">Stay ashore or leave the island</bold>â€”Upon taking the decision to leave the land for a new trip, the female has to consider both the time required to reach the best patch she memorized during the previous trip and the current time. The female leaves her pup at a consistent time, taking into account the constraint of travelling to reach this location at night. Alternatively, females can stay one more night ashore and continue to suckle their pups.
