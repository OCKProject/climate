 <italic class="italic">â€”</italic>Females and pups have a probability to die which depends on their percentage of energy loss at time

The 56% of the initial mass at the beginning of a new fasting event was set according to field observations of pup mortality from starvation (C. Guinet, unpublished data) and 70% was set for females as they had already depleted their body store during the lactation period and which represented on average about 4.2 kg for an initial mass of 31.9 kg (

The reference values were the energy after suckling for the pup, and the initial energy of the female (E
