<p class="p">Several processes can be involved every hour, depending on the period and femalesâ€™ location. MarCPFS processes are shown in the flow chart diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). During the prospective prenatal period (15 days), the female explores the environment map and memorizes the richest resources locations. At the end of this period the pup is born and the time is set to zero. The simulation starts with both the female and its pup on the island. Every hour, both female's and pup's energetic status were updated (see Maternal energy balance and Pup energy balance sections below). Once at sea, the female travels directly to reach a memorized favorable feeding area or uses a correlated random walk (CRW) to forage within food-enriched zones or even a simple random walk when searching for new feeding areas (see Female movements section below). Every hour of the simulated period, the female has to make decisions. At night, the female is able to estimate the abundance of the map cell she is visiting and thus to decide either (1) to continue foraging or to return to the island (see Foraging or returning section below) or (2) to fish or to move (see Fishing or moving section below). When at colony, the female has to decide to stay ashore or to return at sea.
