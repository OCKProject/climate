 <bold class="bold">Simulation experimentâ€”</bold>For each simulation, we used a map where the prey abundance level (four levels; Abund), the aggregation level (eight levels; Aggreg) and the distance to the resource (nine distances; Dist) were fixed (Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Each map has been replicated 10 times (Rep
 <sub class="sub">map</sub>) to generate stochasticity in the repartition of prey (see Creation of environmental maps section). For each simulation, female fur seal can be initialized with a given body length (five lengths; Length) and one type of memorization (two types of memorization; Mem). Each simulation was repeated 50 times (Rep). In total, 1,440,000 simulations were performed.
