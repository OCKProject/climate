 <bold class="bold">Output data</bold>
 <italic class="italic">—</italic>All results are expressed as means ± SD obtained on the basis of 10 replicated maps. At each hour, we recorded the location of the female (X
 <sub class="sub">seal</sub>, Y
 <sub class="sub">seal</sub>) and her energetic status. At the end of each simulation, we recorded whether the female and the pup survived and recorded their respective mass. For the foraging behavior, we considered only females that successfully completed their rearing period and we recorded the mean distance travelled per trip (MeanDTrip), the mean trip duration (MeanTTrip), the number of trips (NbrTrip) and the number of fishing events (NbrFishing) which was simply defined by the number of fishing decisions. Hence, when a female decided to fish (see Fishing or Moving section above), because of the time step we chose, the fishing activity of a single hour was recorded as a unique fishing event. We finally recorded the energy gained by fishing (E
 <sub class="sub">fish</sub>) during a fishing event.
