 <bold class="bold">Female and pup survival</bold>—Deaths of both female and pup were recorded in each simulation. To assess the overall reproductive success of the females, we calculated the average success of female-pup pairs (SP) in a given environment, for each of the 10 replicated maps, as follows: 
 <italic class="italic">SP</italic> = (1 - D
 <sub class="sub">f</sub>) × (1 - D
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>), where D
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> and D
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> are the probabilities of death for females and pups, respectively.
