<p class="p">All environmental variables (Dist, Abund and Aggreg) had direct effects on the foraging behavior of females, their mortality rate and final weight. In particular, the response of breeding success to prey spatial distribution parameters was not monotonous, exhibiting a maximum at the intermediate level of aggregation of prey (minimum of pup mortality). The effect of prey aggregation on the reproductive success can be partly explained by female behavioral changes when searching for food (see below). Several environmental conditions (extreme dispersal (Aggreg levels 0 and 1) and/or extreme aggregation of resources (Aggreg levels 8 and 10) and/or low abundance (90 g h
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>)) are clearly unusual or exceptional, as they do not seem to be able to sustain sufficient successful breeding levels (
