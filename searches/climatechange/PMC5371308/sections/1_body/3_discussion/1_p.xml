<p class="p">MarCPFS has several limitations since it considers variations in the horizontal plane only, whereas real females forage in a three-dimensional space. Resources considered in the model are static over time and not distributed in accordance with oceanographic features. The overestimation of final weights can be explained by the uncertainties about real prey abundance and aggregation levels, or the unknown effect of competition. Furthermore, diseases and predation are certainly factors of great importance in the real system. However, the consistency between the emerging results of our model and available observations, and the absence of neither abrupt nor abnormal bifurcation or excessive sensitivity to parameters, suggests that this simulator behaves in a satisfactory manner (
