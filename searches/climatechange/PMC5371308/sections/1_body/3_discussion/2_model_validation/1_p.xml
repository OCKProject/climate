<p class="p">To validate MarCPFS outputs, we compared model outputs to the real pup's survival rate from Reid and Forcada [

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]), moderate aggregation (level 3) and intermediate abundance (180 g h
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), we found final weights corresponding to the actual final weights of females and pups (32.7 ± 0.9 kg, 11.0 ± 3.4 kg for the simulated animals, versus 30.4 ± 0.7 kg, 10.5 ± 0.5 kg for females and pups, respectively ([

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Under such conditions, simulations yielded a survival rate for pups of 86.2 ± 2.2%, which is comparable with field observations: 77.6 ± 20.1% ([

Among all the possible combinations of initial parameters, only this particular combination provided results that replicate field values. We thus hypothesize that these conditions constitute an appropriate approximation of the real spatial distribution of prey. We also used some validation elements of foraging behavior of the female described by Boyd [

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] about the guillemot showed the convergence of the two systems with a special emphasis on the effects of distance and abundance of the resource on the foraging strategies. This constitutes a partial cross validation of the models in the context of marine central place foraging.
