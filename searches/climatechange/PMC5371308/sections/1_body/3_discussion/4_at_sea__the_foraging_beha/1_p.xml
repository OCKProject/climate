 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g002" class="xref">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). In particular, an increase in the aggregation level led to changes in the time spent searching for resource patches of sufficient quality and the mean distance travelled per trip. The curve for the number of fishing events per trip was convex in shape, with a minimum value of 19.4 Â± 4.7 fishing events per trip (Aggreg = 3; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g002" class="xref">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Indeed, for moderately aggregated resources, each fishing event provided a larger amount of energy compared to conditions of dispersed resources. Beyond this threshold value, the aggregation of prey requires animals to spend an even longer time looking for resources patches of sufficiently high quality.
