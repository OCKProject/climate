<p class="p">Qualitatively, our results are consistent with the optimal foraging theory. According to this theory, animals are likely to spend less time in poor-quality patches and more time in high-quality patches of resources [

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Our results suggest that females finding cells, or patches of cells, with a low energy content tend to move away rapidly and search for better foraging locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). However, it could be argued that this finding reflects the presence, in the design of the simulator, of components of such behavior (

 <italic class="italic">g</italic>., correlated random walk movement). We also parameterized the decision making process for diving with the body condition of the animal, because animals lacking energy have to eat, even when confronted with poor patches of resources (see the Fishing or moving section above). These last two features of the model may, at least partly, cancel each other out, and we consider the observed consistency with the optimal foraging theory to be rather an emergent property of the model than a built-in mechanism (
