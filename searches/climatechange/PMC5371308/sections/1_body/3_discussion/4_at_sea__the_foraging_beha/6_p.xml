<p class="p">As for central place foragers, the optimal foraging theory predicts that the load size should increase with the distance travelled from the colony to reach the feeding area [

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] and constitutes a strong constraint over this type of population. Indeed, our results show that the average energy gained by trip increases with Dist (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). On the other hand, the female energy expenditure also increases with Dist. As a consequence, longer distance greatly decreased the growth performances of the pups, which have to fast for prolonged periods of time. These results are consistent with previous findings for fur seals from the Kerguelen Islands showing that the rate of pup mass gain decreases with foraging-trip duration [
