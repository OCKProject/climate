<p class="p">Female body length was found to have an effect on the probability of successfully rearing a pup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). The shortest females were the least successful mothers, in accordance with Beauplet

Globally, when considering all conditions simulated, small females (≤110 cm long) making large numbers of short trips displayed the lowest levels of breeding success (89% pup mortality), whereas larger females (≥ 130 cm) making a lower number of trips were widely more successful (63% pup mortality) (

However, their mortality rates were higher than for small females mainly due to their larger metabolic requirements and higher displacement costs. On the contrary, when considering intermediate/favorable conditions only, there was no appreciable difference in the breeding success (SP) when females were ≥ 115 cm in length (
