<p class="p">Large efforts are dedicated to quantify physical oceanographic changes. However, it is critical to assess the consequences of such changes on marine ecosystems and populations dynamic. In that context, it is crucial to understand and predict how changes in prey distribution and abundance, in response to environmental changes could impact the energy balance of marine top predators. To better understand population changes, it is of utmost importance to explore both the primary causes and underlying behavioral mechanisms impacting on individual fitness. Not to say how fitness is highly dependent on the ability of animals to feed in their environment.</p>
