<p class="p">Such understanding might be critical to identify species at risk and for ecosystem managements. Pinnipeds and seabirds, which are central place foragers (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>., they commute between their breeding (central) colony on land and foraging at sea), are constrained by particular distribution ranges of prey. Therefore, during breeding when they are restricted to a central place foraging strategy, pinnipeds such as otariids and non-flying seabirds should be more impacted by changes in prey distribution [

For instance, within the Southern Oceans, climatic scenarios predict a southward shift of the highly productive Polar Front [
 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], which separates Subantarctic waters from cold waters of Antarctica, with direct consequences on the foraging and breeding performances of king penguins

 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. How central place foragers should modify their provisioning/foraging behavior to accommodate changes in prey accessibility in relation to their colony? According to the optimal foraging theory, foraging strategies are selected on the basis of maximization of the net energy intake rate [
