 <xref rid="pone.0173797.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], named MarCPFS for Marine Central Place Forager Simulator. This work mainly aimed at (i) verifying that outcomes were in accordance, at least qualitatively, with the optimal foraging theory predictions, (ii) understanding why and to what extent the possible environmental variations due to climate change could affect central place foragers’ survival and breeding success, (iii) testing the existence of optimal values for female body length related to the environmental parameters of our simulations (especially the distance to the resource).
