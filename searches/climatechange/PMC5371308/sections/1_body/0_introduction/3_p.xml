<p class="p">A key issue is whether and how quickly predators can compensate for effects of environmental changes through short-term acclimatization or long-term evolutionary adaptation across generations and how phenotypic traits should vary to maximize individual fitness. Phenotypic traits are usually selected under the pressure of multiple environmental constraints [
