<p class="p">Using computer simulations, we attempted to evaluate the potential changes in the breeding success of a central place forager in relation to foraging conditions that could be affected by climate changes (possible change in abundance or/and aggregation or/and accessibility of prey) and the intrinsic features of the parent (body length, foraging strategies and memorization abilities). To investigate separate and combined influence of these factors on breeding success, this study was calibrated on a particular central place forager model: the Antarctic fur seal (
