<p class="p">The ability to memorize significantly affected the mortality rates of both females and pups. When retaining parameters according to the literature (body length of 115 cm; Dist = 150 km), and under quite favorable conditions (Aggreg = 3 and Abund = intermediate level), the memorization ability had no appreciable effect on the mortality of females or pups (
