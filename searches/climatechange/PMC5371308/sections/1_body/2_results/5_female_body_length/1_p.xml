<p class="p">Body length had a positive, although weak, effect on female mortality and a stronger negative effect on that of pups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). We calculated the success of female-pup pairs using Aggreg = 3 and Dist = 150 km, in two conditions of abundance (intermediate and high). In such conditions, females with a body length of 115 cm or more were the most successful (
