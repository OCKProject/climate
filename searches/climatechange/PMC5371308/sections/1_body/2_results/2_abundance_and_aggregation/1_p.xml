<p class="p">The mortality rates of both females and pups increased with prey aggregation, except in conditions of low prey abundance, where the probability of pup death was always close to 1.0 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the lowest pup mortality rates were observed with intermediate levels of food aggregation, in conditions in which prey abundance was sufficiently high. Female mortality varied most strongly when prey abundance was low. The lowest female mortalities were recorded with aggregation levels 2 and 3.
