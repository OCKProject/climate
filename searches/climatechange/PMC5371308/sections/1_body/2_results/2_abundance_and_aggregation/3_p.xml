<p class="p">Higher levels of prey aggregation were associated with a longer mean trip distance, up to aggregation levels 6 then MeanDTrip decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g002" class="xref">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, an aggregation level 6 seems to be a critical threshold in terms of both the distance travelled and the time spent at sea per trip (five days: 119 ± 1.3 h). NbrFishing decreased monotonically with Aggreg, from 299.5 ± 1.0 (highly dispersed) to 233.9 ± 1.9 (highly aggregated). The NbrTrip was highest for an aggregation level 3 (14.5 ± 1.0). Finally, with aggregation levels up to 3, NbrFishing steadily decreased, as each successful dive provided a sufficient amount of food (
