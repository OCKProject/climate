<p class="p">The MeanDTrip over the rearing period was proportional to Dist (from 568.8 ± 3.5 km to 1,010 ± 8.5 km, Dist ranging from 100 to 500 km; R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.94). Similarly, the time spent at sea (MeanTTrip) increased with mean distance travelled (from 85.7 ± 0.6 h to 150.7 ± 1.3 h). However, the NbrTrip was reduced when Dist increased (
