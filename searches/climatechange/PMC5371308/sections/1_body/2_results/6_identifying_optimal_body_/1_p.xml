<p class="p">Calculation of the (energetic cost) / (success of female-pup pairs) ratio (E/SP) revealed that, for each distance, there exist a minimal value corresponding to an optimal female body length. These optimal body lengths increased with the distance to the resource (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>). The E/SP ratio looks like a quadratic relationship with the distance the females have to cover (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g007" class="xref">Fig 7B</xref>). When considering the optimal female body length as a function of the distance to be covered we find a positive linear relationship (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173797.g007" class="xref">Fig 7C</xref>). Outcomes showed that the success of the female-pup pairs (SP) should decrease in a quadratic relation with the female body length and consequently with the average distance that must be covered per trip (
