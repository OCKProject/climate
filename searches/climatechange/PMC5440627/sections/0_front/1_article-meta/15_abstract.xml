 <p class="p">Climate change may alter building energy demand. Here, the authors quantify changes in residential electricity and natural gas demand in Los Angeles County and find that rising temperatures may increase electricity demand by 41â€“87% between 2020 and 2060, but improved efficiency could lower this increase to 28%.</p>
