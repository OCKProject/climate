<p class="p">With the exception of lighting and plug loads, we assume the number of appliances utilized is linearly proportional to the number of dwelling units. We do not alter the distribution of appliances throughout the scenarios, only the energy consumption, with the exception of the â€˜plug loads' category that captures use by miscellaneous appliances in homes (for example, cell phones, electronics, blenders and so on). This section discusses the per unit changes in appliances, not to the total amount consumed by each category.</p>
