<p class="p">BEopt output is in hourly increments (as is the BEopt core simulation engine, EnergyPlus), and we aggregate this to yearly resolution for the calibration to be consistent with the LADWP data. To get the total consumption for the residential building stock, we normalize HVAC end-use consumption per square foot by archetype, and multiply the square footage of each archetype category within each CBG. The RASS survey reports the frequency of use of HVAC equipment by time of day, and in many archetype categories, a non-negligible percentage of inhabitants own HVAC equipment, but left it off the majority of the time. We utilize this â€˜non-use' percentage to adjust the typical energy consumption of the archetypes. In addition, we simulate lighting with the 51 simulation archetypes and normalize per square foot, but we maintain appliances at the per archetype level. In the aggregation, appliance types were maintained so that end-use could be ascertained in the final model and tracked in the forecast.</p>
