<p class="p">We develop custom building archetypes based upon our previous work
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>, which were then subdivided by climate zone, period of construction and residential building type. There are 140 potential archetype categories, as we consider seven major time periods, five climate zones and four building types (7 × 5 × 4=140), but we aggregate this further to ensure sufficient survey responses in RASS for each archetype. This results in a total of 84 archetypes (
