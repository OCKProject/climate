<p class="p">For these 51 categories, we develop models in BEopt using data from the three sources on the thermal properties of the building (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 14</xref>). We do this to obtain a more representative â€˜weighted average' for HVAC end-use energy consumption. For example, in RASS, the survey responses indicated that the main heating technology across most archetypes is a NG furnace of 78% efficiency. However, if we only simulate this one technology for all archetypes, we would fail to capture the true variability in heating technologies (and associated energy use) that exists. Instead, we run all of the technologies in BEopt and weight the energy consumption by archetype category based on the RASS survey responses.
