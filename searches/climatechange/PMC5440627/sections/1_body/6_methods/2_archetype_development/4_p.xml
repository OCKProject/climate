<p class="p">We next group all of the residential buildings of LAC in the Los Angeles Assessor database into each of the 84 categories. We use characteristics from the Assessor database as specifications for the archetypes (for example, average building size), and the grouping also allows for the final simulation results to be scaled to the county level. For each of the 84 categories, we compiled a profile of the typical building shape (perimeter to area ratio), predominant material in the framing, average size and quality class from the Assessor database (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). California assessors use the quality class designation to indicate greater quality and home value. In some cases, this means improved thermal properties as well. For archetypes that are in the same climate zone that have the same predominant quality class and similar floor areas, we combine them to save on computation time. We maintain all 84 archetypes for appliance assessment, but for the building simulations we use a condensed 51 simulation models (
