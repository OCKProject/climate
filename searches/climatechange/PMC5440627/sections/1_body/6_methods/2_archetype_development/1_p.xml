<p class="p">In developing the archetypes, we utilize three major sources of information: the Residential Appliance Saturation Survey (RASS), the LAC Assessor database and the California Assessor's Handbook. RASS is a California-specific appliance survey administered by the California Energy Commission that captures a diverse set of variables on building thermal properties and appliance use. The most recent RASS survey, from 2008, contains ∼6,500 survey responses for LAC, and we used these responses to inform appliance distribution within each archetype and some material properties of the buildings (

In addition, the California Assessor's Handbook provides ‘typical' characteristics of buildings in different quality classes, and it exists as a reference for assessing property value in the state of California. We use the handbook as a complement to the Assessor's database and RASS to add in additional details on thermal properties for each. We give a summary of the data from each source in
