<p class="p">In this equation, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">y</sub> is per cent air-conditioning saturation in a given year, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> is the initial saturation, CDD is the cooling degree days of the future year and CDD
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> is the initial number of CDD. We apply this relationship for every climate zone and every year for all four average RCPs to obtain saturation rates for every year. Since CDD can be somewhat variable from year to year in the forecasts, we forward fill saturation rates so that an air-conditioning saturation rate in a future year cannot be less than in a previous year. For example, if 2034 projects fewer CDD than 2033, we apply the 2033 saturation rate to 2034 since those who purchased air conditioners in 2033 will not discard them the next year. We then apply the saturation rates to archetypes for that climate zone in that year.
