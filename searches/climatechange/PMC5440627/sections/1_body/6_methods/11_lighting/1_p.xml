Beyond increasing the efficiency of incandescent light bulbs, this has driven down the cost of alternative light bulbs such as compact fluorescent lighting and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The US Department of Energy forecasts that these changes, particularly the adoption of LEDs, will reduce residential electricity consumption from lighting by 53% below 2013 levels by 2030 (ref.
