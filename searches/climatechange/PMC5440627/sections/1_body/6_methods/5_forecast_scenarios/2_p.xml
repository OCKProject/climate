<p class="p">In a previous study, we assessed historic building turnover trends in LAC, and developed a model of building turnover based upon initial year of construction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. In addition to housing growth, we include these building turnover rates in the stock model by replacing older vintages with newer vintages of the same classification and climate zone. For Scenarios 1 and 2 we utilize the same rates as in our previous paper, and in Scenarios 3 and 4 we augment the turnover to be 10 times the natural rate to represent incentives for building turnover and building shell upgrades (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). We did not model building shell upgrades individually (for example, improved windows, insulation and so on), but instead we use augmented turnover as a proxy for shell upgrades since newer archetypes have more efficient thermal shells. In applying the population growth and building turnover, we spatially distribute the changes based upon the location of existing dwelling units. For population growth, in reality, new construction might be more likely to occur in less populated CBGs rather than densifying existing areas.
