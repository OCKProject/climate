<p class="p">In the archetype calibration, we run the models with 28 different heating and cooling technologies, and for the forecasting we included additional 11 technologies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 20</xref>). To run the full ensemble, this would result in 3,261,960 building simulations, which is computationally limiting. To capture the differences in heating and cooling technologies without running this many simulations, we run the full set of technologies for a single GCM and develop a linear relationship between heating/cooling load of the building and the resulting energy consumption by that technology within that archetype category. In our testing, this method captures the actual amount of energy used by the technology within Â±4%. We utilize these factors in post processing to compute energy consumption for each of the 3,261,960 cases without having to run each of the simulations.
