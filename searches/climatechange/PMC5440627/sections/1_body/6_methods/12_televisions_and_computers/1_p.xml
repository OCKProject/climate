<p class="p">The CEC has proposed regulations on computers and monitors that would take effect in 2017 and 2018. This rule would set performance standards for laptops, desktops and monitors as well as target standby energy consumption
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref>. The CEC projects that this rule would reduce consumption of desktop computers by 60% and laptops by 10%. In our forecasts, we assume a computer and television energy reduction of 30% by 2060 for Scenarios 1 and 2, of 50% for Scenario 3 and 70% for Scenario 4.
