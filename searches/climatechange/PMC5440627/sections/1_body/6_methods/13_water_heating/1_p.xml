<p class="p">We include nine different types of water heaters with four different fuels (electric, gas, propane and solar). In the scenario development, energy consumption could be changed within a archetype category by (1) switching to another type of water heater or (2) changing the efficiency of the nine classifications. For type switching in Scenario 1, we utilize purchase profiles of the domestic hot water market
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref> and for Scenarios 2 utilize the same distribution, but restrict purchases to include only electric and solar product types. In Scenario 3 we increase the proportion of heat pumps and solar water heaters to 30% of the total replacement stock by 2060, and in Scenario 4 these technologies comprise 70% of the stock with electric tankless systems making up the remaining 30%. In 2015, Department of Energy efficiency standards went into effect for hot water heaters. For small residential water heaters (&lt;55 gallons), these regulations will improve efficiency by âˆ¼4%. For larger units, efficiency will improve by at least 25% (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>). For all water heater types, we extrapolated the efficiency savings to 20% of the total by 2060 for Scenarios 1 and 2, 40% for Scenario 3 and 60% for Scenario 4.
