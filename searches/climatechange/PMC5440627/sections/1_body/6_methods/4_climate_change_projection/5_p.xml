For our study, the base weather files are the EPWs developed by the CEC for each of the 16 climate zones in the state of California and available as default files for BEopt. Effectively, this morphing transformation matches the maximum and minimum daily temperatures from the GCM and scales the intermediate hours based on the EPW pattern. For each morphed temperature trajectory, we use a 4-h weighted average to smooth discontinuities between days. In total, we create 1,640 EPW files (10 GCMs × 4 RCPs × 41 years) for each of the five climate zones. These files can then be run with our 51 calibrated archetypes. To be included in our simulation, each climate model must accurately predict the average number of cooling degree days (CDDs) between 1970 and 2000 within plus or minus 10%. We provide a summary of the included GCMs in
