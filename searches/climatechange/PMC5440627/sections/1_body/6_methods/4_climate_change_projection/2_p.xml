<p class="p">The Intergovernmental on Climate Change's fifth assessment report utilizes four different projections of atmospheric carbon concentrations known as RCPs. Each RCP was developed by an independent modelling team and is designated by their year 2100 radiative forcing level. For example, the most optimistic scenario RCP 2.6 was developed by the IMAGE modelling team at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency has a radiative forcing peak at 3.1 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> around the year 2050, but by the year 2100 emissions have been reduced enough to have forcing at 2.6 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> by 2100 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>). RCP 4.5 was developed by the MiniCAM team at Pacific Northwest national Laboratory in the United States, and represents a scenario of stabilizing radiative forcing to 4.5 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> well before 2100 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>). RCP 6.0 models radiative forcing stabilizing at 6.0 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> right at 2100 and was created by the AIM modelling team at Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref>. The most pessimistic scenario, RCP 8.5, was developed by the MESSAGE team at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and includes continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions through 2100 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>). In this study, we use 10 GCMs for each of the four RCPs to capture a range of future climate scenarios that could have an impact on residential energy consumption.
