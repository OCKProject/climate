<p class="p">We develop custom EPW files for each of the five climate zones in LAC in order to forecast changes in building performance under GCM temperature changes. These files are the weather data input for the building simulation software, BEopt. In traditional (that is, non-forecasting) applications, EPW files represent a â€˜typical' year of meteorological activity for a location, by combining historic weather data (often up to 30 years). This can then be used as a standard for predicting and comparing building performance in a single location, given the assumption that the climate of the location is not changing. In order to use EPWs for forecasting, a unique EPW file must be developed for each forecast and year.</p>
