<p class="p">Without efficiency intervention, electricity demand in LAC could increase by as much as 87% under Business as Usual (BAU) with heavy electrification (Scenario 2 and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5) or by nearly 47% in BAU without increased electrification (Scenario 1 and RCP 8.5; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Scenario 1 represents an energy future with minimal efficiency increases beyond current policies, and Scenario 2 represents a future that incentivizes heavy electrification of water and space heating without improving efficiency beyond Scenario 1. Under the most optimistic climate, RCP 2.6, electricity demand increases for Scenarios 1 and 2 are 41% and 78%, respectively. We develop these two cases to represent the upper and lower bounds of potential energy savings. In these scenarios, increasing demand is driven by (1) increased adoption of cooling equipment, (2) increased use of cooling equipment as average temperatures increase, (3) population growth and (4) moderate increases in plug loads. These baseline scenarios also include a decrease in NG use, yielding a minimal total energy consumption decrease of 0–1% for Scenario 1 and a decrease of 14–18% for Scenario 2, indicating that without increases in efficiency. These increases are comparable to previous energy forecasts for LAC
