<p class="p">The spatial distribution of electricity demand increases is not uniform throughout LAC and depends upon climate zone, age of building and appliances, and consumption behaviour differences of inhabitants (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) because of the older buildings with aging appliances and poorer insulation as well as the higher temperatures in this area. Inland regions experience the highest increases in temperatures and subsequent energy use under higher RCPs, but under low RCPs these are the areas where net savings could be realized. Location-specific efficiency upgrades, especially with regards to building shell improvements and heating and cooling equipment upgrades, could be an effective pathway to maximize energy reduction per dollar invested in efficiency programmes. Spatial results are tabulated in
