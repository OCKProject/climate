<p class="p">To ensure reliability, electrical grids must be designed to meet highest demand periods that occur in hot summer months, and our simulations show that the peak demand could more than triple under RCP 8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This is a larger capacity expansion than the 87% increase in total annual consumption would suggest. Furthermore, previous studies point out that the statistically downscaled weather forecasts tend to underestimate peak temperature increases
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>, which means that increases in maximum annual peak demand might be even greater than what is captured in our model. Unlike NG, which is available on-site and on-demand, electricity provision is met from capacity across states, which must be planned in advance and actively managed so that supply can continually meet demand. A scenario with large-scale fuel-switching between electricity and NG could mean an expansion of electricity infrastructure, potentially including the addition of expensive generation stations. A more cost-effective approach might be investing in efficiency; in RCP 8.5, aggressive efficiency reduces the 40-year maximum annual demand increase from 226% to 124%. Efficiency can save money for homeowners

For 2060 in Scenario 2 under RCP 8.5, air conditioning is responsible for 85% of electricity consumption at the peak hour; therefore, targeting energy efficiency in cooling equipment (and building thermal shells) could be the most effective approach for reducing peak electricity demand.
