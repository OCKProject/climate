<p class="p">Our results show that, while BAU Scenarios 1 and 2 forecast increases in total energy use under all RCPs, accelerating the adoption of efficient appliances (Scenarios 3 and 4) can offset some or most of the increased demand (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In the two mitigation scenarios under RCP 8.5, energy efficiency can narrow increases in electricity consumption to between 34 and 59%, and total energy use changes between −26 and −37%. In Scenario 4 under RCP 2.6 (the most optimistic climate and aggressive policy scenario) electricity use is projected to increase by 34%, and total energy use to decline by 40% (driven by NG reductions). This is over a period with a projected population increase of 17%. This suggests that energy efficiency could be a viable resource for mitigating increases in energy use. Full results for total demand are in
