<p class="p">The goal of this study is to forecast residential electricity use in LAC, California, under future climate conditions, and to explore the potential for energy efficiency to offset some of the increased demand. Multiple models exist for energy simulation and forecasting. According to Swan and Ugursal
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>, residential sector models fall into one of two larger categories: bottom-up or top-down (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Under this categorization, top-down models are based upon historic, high-level variables such as macroeconomic parameters. The advantages to this modelling approach are availability of data, simplicity of the model and ability to rely upon historic trends in developing a forecast. Top-down models, however, have difficulty forecasting long time horizons, when the base assumptions upon which the model was built have changed (for example, rapidly accelerating population growth, transformational technologies and so on)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. Furthermore, top-down models do not subdivide end-use types, which makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement or to understand the physical and behavioural drivers of energy consumption. In contrast, bottom-up models calculate the energy consumption of a subgroup of buildings and then extrapolate to represent the entire building sector. Statistical bottom-up models utilize historic relationships between energy consumption and building end-uses to develop mathematical relationships among the parameters
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, whereas engineering bottom-up models calculate the energy consumption of the end-uses based on the equipment in the buildings without any historic information
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The advantage to bottom-up approaches is that end-uses can be directly predicted and targeted for improvement, at the disadvantage of having much greater complexity, data requirements and computation time. Within the engineering bottom-up classification, using building â€˜archetypes' is a common technique for simulating the electricity use within a city or a city sector

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref> underscore the lack of available data for identifying technical and behaviour trends for developing quality bottom-up models. To avoid this limitation, many models used for long-term forecasts employ a top-down approach
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. An emerging group of studies have applied bottom-up archetype and statistical models for climate forecasting

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. An advantage of these studies is that most preserve building end-uses, which is useful for policy recommendations. The majority of these studies simplify the building characteristics to be single zone spaces, estimating thermal loads by balancing heat transfer equations, and do not capture the heterogeneity of the building stock. In addition, the climate change analysis is often a sensitivity analysis to temperature instead of a forecast of future conditions. Dirks

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref> develop the forecast with a diverse amount of physical models in EnergyPlus for both residential and commercial buildings across a large portion of the eastern United States with over 26,000 different combinations of technology and building configurations. Climate change is incorporated from a statistically downscaled general circulation model (GCM). Similarly, Wang and Chen
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref> use a GCM with two EnergyPlus archetypes representing all of the US residential stock.
