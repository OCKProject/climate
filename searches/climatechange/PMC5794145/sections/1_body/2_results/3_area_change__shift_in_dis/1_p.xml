From the present to the 2080s, the mean centers of highly suitable areas would shift from Yunyang (current) to Jianshi (2030s), Fengjie (2050s and 2070s) and Enshi (2080s). The shift in distance of the mean centers from the present location to the simulated location in the 2080s is approximately 73.87 km to the southeast (
