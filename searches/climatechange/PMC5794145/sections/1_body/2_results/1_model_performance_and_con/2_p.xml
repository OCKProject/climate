 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192153.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows that the MaxEnt models that predicted the distribution of Psa in the future period performed “excellent”, with high AUC values (0.949–0.964). The results indicate that the simulations have high reliability and can be used to analyze the impact of climate change on the distribution of Psa in China.
