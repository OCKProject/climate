The other 18 environmental variables, including temperature (maximum temperature in September, October, November, and December; minimum temperature in March, April, and November; mean temperature in May; mean diurnal range, max temperature of the warmest month, min temperature of the coldest month, annual temperature range, mean temperature of the driest quarter), annual precipitation (precipitation in September and December, annual precipitation, precipitation of the driest month) and altitude, individually contributed less (a combined total contribution of 44.7%) to run the model. Considering the importance of permutation, the mean temperature in May (21.8%), mean temperature of coldest quarter (14.8%) and mean diurnal range (10%) each played a vital role in predicting the probable distribution of Psa, and individually, they contributed more than the other variables to run the model.
