<p class="p">ArcGIS 10.0 was used to analyze the simulation results from the MaxEnt model for further study. The result showed that the area from latitude 25째 to 36째N and from longitude 101째 to 122째E was the primary potential suitable region of Psa in China. Based on the division criteria of suitability for Psa, the main suitable regions of Psa in China were extracted by ArcGIS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192153.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The potential suitable areas were mainly located in the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Hubei, Zhejiang, Gansu, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangsu, Henan and Anhui, which occupied 27.78% of the land of China. The highly suitable area (with suitability values between 66 and 100) was mainly concentrated in Northeast Sichuan, South Shaanxi, most of Chongqing, West Hubei and Southwest Gansu. The areas of highly suitable areas in the major producing provinces were analyzed statistically (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192153.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), and it showed that the most suitable areas of Psa occupied 4.94% of the land of China. Sichuan (1.38%), Shaanxi (0.84%), Hubei (0.6%), Chongqing (0.59%) and Zhejiang (0.48%) were considered to be the major suitable provinces for Psa.
