<p class="p">According to the response curve of mean temperature of the coldest quarter, the probability of Psa occurrence increased up to 8.1°C and deceased sharply after that. Similar trends were observed for maximum temperature in April, and the response curve indicated that Psa would survive in locations where the maximum temperature in April was between 13.7–23.6°C; however, the probability of Psa decreased rapidly above 21.2°C. The response curve of precipitation in May indicated that higher levels of precipitation (50.1–317 mm) in May would be conducive for the development of cankers caused by Psa. The response curve of the minimum temperature in October showed that Psa can tolerate a wider range of temperatures (3.6 to 17.1°C) in October.</p>
