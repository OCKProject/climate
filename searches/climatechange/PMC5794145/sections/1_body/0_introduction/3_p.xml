In Shaanxi Province in 2012, an outbreak of kiwifruit canker was recorded in a red-fleshed cultivar of ‘Hongyang’ and in a green-fleshed kiwifruit cultivar of ‘Xuxiang’. The percentage of trees impacted by the disease ranged from 20% to 70%, even up to 100% in some places [

An investigation into the bacterial canker of kiwifruit in Sichuan Province between 2014 and 2016 showed that the disease had common occurrence patterns in different production areas, and the situation is worsening as growing areas expand.
