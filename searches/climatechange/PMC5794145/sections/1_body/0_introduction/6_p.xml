 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Plant disease is one of the most serious biological disasters to impact agricultural production and is constrained by climate change, host plants, tillage management and farming systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The distribution and abundance of plant diseases are highly influenced by climatic factors (i.e., temperature, moisture, humidity and their seasonal variations) [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Temperature is one of the most influential environmental factors affecting the distribution and abundance of different species [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In the context of global climate change, where trends indicate increasing temperatures, variations in precipitation and more frequent and extreme weather events have occurred. Additionally, the environment has changed, which has resulted in changes in the areas and periods of plant diseases and led to changes in distribution, occurrence, epidemiology and population structure [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. SDM is an effective tool for studying the impact of future climate change on species distribution and provides a variety of realistic scenarios to expound the influence of climatic factors on the epidemiological traits of pathogens. SDMs utilize a series of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, which are based on global climate models (GCMs), to analyze the influence of climate change on current and future habitat suitability of various species [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Accurate predictions regarding the future state of species will not be provided in SDM at any given point in time, but the possible niche that species may occupy in the future is provided [
