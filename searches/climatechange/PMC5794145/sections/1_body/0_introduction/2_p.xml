<p class="p">Bacterial canker of kiwifruit caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas syringae pv</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">actinidiae</italic> (Psa) is a destructive disease of kiwifruit that causes great losses in kiwifruit production. The disease not only causes great economic losses but also increases the plant mortality of kiwifruit, and to date, there has not been an effective control measure identified [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The symptoms and the infection cycle of bacterial canker are consistent throughout the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Symptoms usually appear in the spring or autumn under climatic conditions that are suitable for disease development. The canker spots can occur on twigs, trunks, leaves and flowers. It first appears as a watery lesion on twigs and trunks, then expands into a white exudation, and eventually turns into a rusty-red profuse exudation [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Affected branches necrose, water and nutrient transport are restricted, eventually causing the plant organs to wither and die. The symptoms on the leaves began to appear in early April, when the chlorosis transitions from pale brown to tan; it eventually becomes dark-brown with a surrounding yellow halo and finally wilts and curls. When the buds are infected, the growth rate slows or even prevents flowering, which results in fruit drop or the formation of deformed fruit [
