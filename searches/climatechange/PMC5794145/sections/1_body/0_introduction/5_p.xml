<p class="p">The study of suitable habitat is an important field of ecology, and the species distribution model (SDM) has evolved and become an important tool for studying the suitability of a habitat for a particular species [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The SDM assumes a species niche should be conserved over space and time, assesses the potential geographical distribution of a target species based on presence/absence data and uses the corresponding mathematical variables to determine habitat preferences for a species. At present, SDMs are mainly applied and influence the following aspects: research on species’ potential geographical distribution, analysis of the relationship between species distribution and climate change, prediction of the habitat suitability of endangered species, and the study of paleogeography [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. An SDM model, i.e., the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), has many advantages, including short running time, easy operation, small sample size and high simulation precision, and was applied to simulate the suitable geographical distribution of species suitability [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In recent years, many researchers have used MaxEnt to simulate the distribution of many plant diseases, such as citrus huanglongbing (caused by
