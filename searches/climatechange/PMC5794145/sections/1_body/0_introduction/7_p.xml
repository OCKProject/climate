In an effort to analyze the effects of climate change on the potential distribution of Psa, MaxEnt was utilized to model the current niches of Psa in China, as well as the future Psa niches under climate change scenarios; additionally, this study identified climatic variables important for the potential establishment of Psa. These results can provide an important reference and theoretical basis for the development of reasonable prevention and control measures.
