<p class="p">In this study, we successfully modeled the current niches of Psa in China, as well as future niches under three climate change scenarios, which allowed for the identification of climatic variables important for the potential establishment of Psa. This study concludes that under scenario RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, the habitat suitability of Psa will increase until the 2080s. We suggest that future climate scenarios should be included in the control measures of Psa, which were created by the institutions responsible for agricultural management.</p>
