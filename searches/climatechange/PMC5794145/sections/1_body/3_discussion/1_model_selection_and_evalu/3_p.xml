<p class="p">At present, the most widely used method for model accuracy evaluation is the ROC curve method (AUC method). Because AUC is not affected by diagnostic thresholds, as it provides performance evaluation results at all threshold ranges, it is now recognized as a niche model evaluator. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, where the closer the value is to 1, the higher the accuracy of the model [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. In this study, the AUC average values of the simulated training set based on the dominant environmental variables were greater than 0.949 (i.e., very close to 1), and the predicted results reached the "excellent" level, indicating that the geographical distribution of the predicted model is in high agreement with the actual distribution. In addition, this study used ArcGIS to postulate the raster files of the MaxEnt output so that the distribution data of the target species and the environmental variable data corresponded to the grid cells, effectively reduced system error, and further improved the accuracy of the data.
