<p class="p">At present, most studies researching Psa are concentrated on small-scale ranges, while there are relatively few studies that examine the potential geographic distribution of Psa on large scales and model future niches under climate change scenarios. Based on the maximum entropy principle, the MaxEnt software uses the species distribution data and the environmental variables to analyze the distribution state of the species when the entropy is the largest [
