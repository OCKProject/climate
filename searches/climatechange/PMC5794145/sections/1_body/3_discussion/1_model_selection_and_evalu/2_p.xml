<p class="p">The results showed that the choice of environmental variables has a certain influence on the prediction results of niche models. Many researchers that use the MaxEnt model to predict the geographical distribution of species non-selectively use all of the environmental factors or the major environmental factors [

The environmental variables, which were obtained from the WorldClim database and CCAFS, are based on temperature and rainfall data based on the different needs of the occurrence calculations. Therefore, there are inevitable relationships between the auto correlation of these variables, multiple linear repetition and other issues. Studies have confirmed that these highly relevant variables introduce redundant information into the model prediction process, which affects the prediction results [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. To avoid these problems when modeling, relevant analysis and effective screening of environmental variables should be carried out before subsequent analyses occurs. In this study, the importance of the variables was evaluated by examining the contribution rate of each factor to species distribution. The environmental variables with small contribution rates were excluded, and the correlation of the selected variables was analyzed using only the leading the environmental variables; additionally, the model was reconstructed to reduce the impact of redundant information on the simulation results and to improve the accuracy of the prediction results.
