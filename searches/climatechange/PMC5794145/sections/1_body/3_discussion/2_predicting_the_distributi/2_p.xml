<p class="p">In this study, the area under three climate change scenarios was statistically analyzed with ArcGIS to identify the trends of the area impacted by disease. The results showed that under both scenario RCP2.6 and scenario RCP4.5, suitable areas of Psa would increase until the 2080s; in contrast, under scenario RCP8.5, the highly suitable areas decreased from the present until the 2080s. This indicated that different emission scenarios have different and opposite effects on the potential distribution of Psa in China.</p>
