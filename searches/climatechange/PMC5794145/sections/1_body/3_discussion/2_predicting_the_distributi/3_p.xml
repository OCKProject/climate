<p class="p">Climate is a decisive factor in species distribution, while changes in species distribution patterns are the most clear and direct reflection of climate change. Climate change characteristics influenced by global warming have been changing the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems, thus changing the biological habitats and geographical distribution of species [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. The results showed that mean centers of highly suitable areas will change in a variety of ways under the three emission scenarios until the 2080s. Under scenario RCP4.5 and scenario RCP8.5, the mean centers will move to the northwest. The movement may be related to the increase in the average temperature and precipitation. In addition, from the simulation results, no obvious regularities were found in the location and displacement of the mean centers under the different scenarios. This may be due to the lack of continuity between current and future climate variables. The current period is from 1950 to 2000, while the future period is from 2030 to 2080, and there is a gap between 2000 and 2030. The reciprocating movement of the mean center may be due to the lack of data during this period.
