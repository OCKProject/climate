<p class="p">The present use of GIS technology to simulate the spatial distribution patterns of species is an important tool. More and more studies have used GIS and statistical analysis methods to identify the relationship between species richness and spatial heterogeneity [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. In this study, a combination of MaxEnt and ArcGIS was used to predict the potential geographic distribution of Psa in China. The results showed that, under current climatic conditions, the area from latitude 25° to 36°N and from longitude 101° to 122°E is the primary potential suitable area of Psa in China. The highly suitable area was mainly concentrated in Northeast Sichuan, South Shaanxi, most of Chongqing, West Hubei and Southwest Gansu and occupied 4.94% of land in China. From 2014 to 2016, we investigated the occurrence of kiwifruit bacterial canker in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. The result showed that the disease is mainly distributed in Guangyuan, Bazhong, Mianyang, Chengdu, Yaan and Yibin in Sichuan province, and in Xian, Baoji and Weinan in Shaanxi province. The potential distribution of this study was highly coincident with the locations of field surveys in Shaanxi and Sichuan. In an earlier study, Shao

The results showed that potential areas of the pathogen were mainly distributed in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizho, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Chongqing and Tibet. Our model predictions are aligned with the predictions of Shao et al [

The differences could be due to the model simulation theory and specific assumptions, types of environmental variables and calibration settings. For instance, as a type of correlative model, fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation based on direct measures of physiological variables ignores biotic interactions, while MaxEnt is based on observations and includes the effects of biotic interactions.
