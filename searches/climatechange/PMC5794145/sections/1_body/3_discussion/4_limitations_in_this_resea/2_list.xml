  <p class="p">The environmental variables used in the prediction by the MaxEnt model are all climatic variables except for altitude. The 19 bioclimatic variables are the climatic extremes, i.e., the maximum and the minimum of the actual distribution of Psa. The MaxEnt model shows the maximum likelihood of species distribution and cannot be prepared to express species in the main areas of actual distribution. The above forecast results are more focused on understanding and demonstrating the potential geographical distribution of Psa and revealing the climate characteristics suitable for the distribution of species.</p>

  <p class="p">The basic niche is an ideal niche, which refers to the maximum niche that a species occupies under ideal living conditions without competition by any other species. The theory only needs to consider the influence of abiotic factors. When the prediction of the suitable area is based not only on the demand of the species in the niche but also on the actual living environment, the biological factors (such as the interaction between species, the vegetation type, geomorphological features, the species own diffusion ability and the soil type) will also have a significant impact on the potential distribution of the predicted species. Based on the above reasons, it can be deduced that the model predicts a niche that is larger than the actual niche occupied by Psa. In this regard, the next step, in addition to considering the impact of climate factors, should consider the interaction between species and other biological factors expressed in order to improve the modelâ€™s predictive effect.</p>

  <p class="p">Over the past 30 years, with the continuous discharge and maintenance of greenhouse gases, the global climate is warming abnormally, and climate change can cause changes in species growth and distribution patterns. The environmental variables used in this study were derived from the world climate database, the WorldClim, which includes data from 1950-2000s; however, this database is missing recent climate data for at least the past 10 years. In the future, the missing data should be filled in so that the forecast results are more accurate and reliable.</p>
