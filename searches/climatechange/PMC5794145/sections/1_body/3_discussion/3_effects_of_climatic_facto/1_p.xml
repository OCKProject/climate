<p class="p">Studying the interaction between species and the environment is an essential aspect of species ecology[
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. The relationship between the probability of species presence and dominant environmental variables was analyzed in this paper, and the response curves were created by MaxEnt. The analysis showed that the probability of species presence changed as a result of the dominant environmental variables (maximum temperature in April, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation in May and minimum temperature in October). Both the precipitation and temperature variables were strongly correlated with the distribution of Psa. Our results were in good agreement with some previous research conclusions. For example, previous research by Marcelletti and Scortichini found low temperature, abundant rainfall and high humidity were the most favorable conditions for disease development [

The model results showed that the probability that Psa would be present decreased rapidly above 21.2°C, which is consistent with the previous experimental findings of Serizawa and Ichikawa, who found that once temperatures exceeded 25°C, the harm caused by Psa weakened [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Overall, these studies suggested that the occurrence of Psa is closely related to climate, and further studies about this will be useful for predicting and forecasting the kiwifruit canker.
