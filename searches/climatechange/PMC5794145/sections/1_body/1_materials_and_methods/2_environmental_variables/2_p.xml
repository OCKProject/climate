<p class="p">Environmental variables derived from WorldClim and CCAFS, which has been widely used in the prediction of the potential distribution of species, can reflect the characteristics of temperature and precipitation as well as their seasonal variation characteristics. The 19 bioclimatic variables with strong biological significance explained the adaptation of species with extreme environmental factors. These variables were also suitable for describing the distribution of species across large scales such as the intercontinental scale [

 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] method on how to filter available variables for modeling, the jackknife test was used to evaluate each variable’s contribution to the simulation, and 25 variables were removed due to their lack of contribution (percent contribution = 0). Next, the highly correlated variables were eliminated, and variables with a Pearson’s |r|≤0.8 were retained. After this process, 22 variables (
