 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In the Worldclim database, ‘current period’ was defined from 1950 to 2000, and these data have been widely used in creating species distribution models. In 2013, the Fifth Assessment Report was released by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and four representative concentration pathways (RCPs, including RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) were published in the report [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The impacts of climate change strategies on greenhouse gas emissions are considered more in the RCPs scenarios, and the projection of future climate change is more scientifically described. RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are medium greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and RCP4.5 is of higher priority than RCP6.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Therefore, RCP2.6 (the minimum greenhouse gas emission scenario), RCP4.5 (the medium greenhouse gas emission scenario) and RCP8.5 (the maximum greenhouse gas emission scenario) for the 2030s (2021–2040), 2050s (2041–2060), 2070s (2061–2080) and 2080s (2071–2090) were selected for the future model prediction of Psa in China. The future environmental variables were downloaded from the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) website. All environmental variables were in raster format with a 2.5-arc minute resolution (~4.5 km
