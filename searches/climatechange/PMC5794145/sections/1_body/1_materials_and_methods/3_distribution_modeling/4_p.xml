<p class="p">For reducing the bias of estimation, in 1949, Quenouille [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] proposed an unbiased method of nonparametric estimation, and Tukey renamed it jackknife in 1958 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. This method can estimate parameters and adjust the deviation without assumptions of distribution probability. In SDM, the jackknife method was used to analyze the effects of environmental variables on model results to choose dominant factors. The specific process involves 1. Calculating the training gain for the model with only variable. Higher training gain indicates that the variable has high prediction power and contributes greatly to species distribution; 2. Calculating the training gain for the model without a specific variable and analyzing the correlation between the removed variable and the omission error. If the removal of an environmental variable leads to a significant increase in the omission error, it indicates that the variable has a significant effect on the modelâ€™s prediction; 3. Calculating the training gain for the model with all variables [
