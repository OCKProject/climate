<p class="p">MaxEnt software was utilized to predict the suitable habitat distribution of Psa in China [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. MaxEnt uses presence-only and small sample size data to model habitat suitability as a function of environmental variables, and it is consistently among the highest performing SDM methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0192153.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Response curves indicate the relationships between climatic variables, and the predicted probability of the presence of Psa was determined by MaxEnt. The percent contribution and permutation importance of environmental variables were calculated, and jackknife procedures were executed in MaxEnt. These analysis methods are all useful to measure the importance of the environmental variables. There were 10 replicates, and a random test percentage was chosen for each replicate. The remaining model values were set to default values [
