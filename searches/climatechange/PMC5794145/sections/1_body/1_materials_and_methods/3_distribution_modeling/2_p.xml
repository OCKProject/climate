<p class="p">MaxEnt estimates the probability a species will be present based on presence records and randomly generates background points by finding the maximum entropy distribution. An estimate of habitat suitability for a species was exported from MaxEnt, and its range generally varied from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest). Model predictions were imported into a geographic information system (GIS), and maps were generated using ArcMap. Four arbitrary categories of habitat suitability for Psa were defined as no suitability (0–5), low suitability (5–33), medium suitability (33–66) and high suitability (66–100) based on predicted habitat suitability.</p>
