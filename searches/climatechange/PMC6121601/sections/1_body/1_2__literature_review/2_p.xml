<p class="p">Many theoretical and empirical studies have investigated low-carbon consumption behavior, green consumption behavior, and other types of energy consumption behavior from different perspectives. These variables are not completely consistent with the low carbon consumption behavior in terms of their connotation and extension, but the conclusions of these studies provide a useful reference for low carbon consumption behavior. Previous studies have explored the key variables related to the mechanism of low-carbon consumption behavior in urban residents. However, studies of external factors such as subjective norms and social responsibility consciousness have mostly considered endogenous psychological factors, including the environmental attitude, environmental values, and other variables [

Personality is the core of individual beliefs, values, and attitudes. Many studies have shown that personality traits have significant impacts on environmental behavior [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Thus, differences in personality affect individual environmental attitudes and environmental behaviors [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Low carbon consumption behavior is an environmental behavioral concept, and thus personality traits may also affect the low carbon consumption behavior of individuals [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], where these variables include gender, age, marital status, education, occupation, and income. In general, theoretical studies have focused on two areas: the factors that influence low-carbon consumption behavior and the internal mechanism involved; and intervention policies and their effectiveness at promoting low-carbon consumption behavior [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The related factors include individual characteristics (such as age, occupation, income, and educational background), endogenous psychological factors, and exogenous situational factors. However, most previous studies focused on either the factors that influence low-carbon consumption behavior or intervention policies, whereas few have attempted to integrate both perspectives by exploring the determinants and intervention policies at the same time [
