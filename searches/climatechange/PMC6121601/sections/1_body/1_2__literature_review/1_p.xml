<p class="p">Obtaining deep insights into the factors that influence the carbon capability of urban residents is important for exploring effective intervention policies. However, there have been few specific analyses of the factors that affect the carbon capability and only a few related studies have considered the capacity for low-carbon behavior. The low carbon consumption ability is regarded as the antecedent variable for low carbon consumption behavior. For example, Mi et al. regarded the “low carbon behavior ability” as a factor that influences “low carbon behavior willingness,” which directly affects the low-carbon energy consumption behavior of urban residents [

Given that the carbon capability is an actual ability, it is necessary to consider its characteristics and the factors that influence it. The factors that influence this ability are genetic, environmental, and non-intellectual (emotional processes, will processes, temperament, and personality) [

In addition, given that knowledge and skills are the cognitive basis of competence, and individual behavior is the carrier of capacity, then low-carbon knowledge/skills are the cognitive basis of low-carbon capability, and low-carbon consumer behavior is the result of carbon capability behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to review the theory of low-carbon knowledge/skills, low-carbon consumption behavior, and related research.
