<p class="p">In this context, previous studies have explored the “carbon capability” concept to measure the motivation and potential of residents regarding reductions in their carbon emissions [

The carbon capability refers to the “capability of individuals to make wise judgments about low carbon and take effective measures.” Previous studies have emphasized the need to consider knowledge, decisions, individual behaviors, and collective behaviors. Evidently, clear judgments and the effective implementation of low-carbon behaviors are core elements of the carbon capability, but the capacity for low-carbon behavior is not equal to the carbon capability itself. According to the classical theory of capability research, i.e., iceberg theory, capability is not confined only to knowledge and skills that comprise the superficial part above the sea level, i.e., the value concept. Instead, the motivation that lurks in the deep part below sea level is the key for distinguishing individual differences in capability [

The capabilities of urban residents that can be observed easily, such as knowledge, skill, and behavior, are explicit features, but the elements lurking below sea level, such as low-carbon value concepts, are motivations that are deeply rooted in residents. These motivations are very important for understanding, evaluating, and improving the low-carbon capability. Wei et al. proposed the concept of the carbon capability [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The carbon capability of urban residents comprises an advanced set of abilities related to the overall process, which ranges from establishing the low carbon value concept, mastering the skills of low carbon identification, making wise low carbon choices, taking effective low carbon actions, and having a low carbon influence. The carbon capability is widely acknowledged as having five dimensions: carbon value, carbon identification, carbon choice, carbon mobility, and carbon impact. The concept of carbon capability maturity was subsequently proposed and it was suggested that an important premise for building guiding policies for developing the carbon capability is exploring the key factors responsible for driving the carbon capability, but these factors have been considered little in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Several studies have focused on the carbon capability concept and standard measurements, but few have conducted specific analyses of the factors that affect the carbon capability. Thus, it is necessary to identify the drivers of carbon generation and development in order to guide and enhance the ability of urban residents to reduce carbon emissions effectively. Essentially, we need to identify the underlying psychological processes related to the carbon capability and understand how these psychological processes contribute to the transformation of low carbon cognition into low carbon behavior. In addition, we need to formulate effective intervention policies to shape and enhance the carbon capability, and ensure the acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions. These issues have not been addressed in previous theoretical studies.
