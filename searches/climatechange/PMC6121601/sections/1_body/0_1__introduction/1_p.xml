<p class="p">Global climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing mankind in the 21st century, where it influences the natural environment and the health and survival of humans and other organisms [

 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. According to the “Global Climate Risk Index 2018”, more than 524,000 people have died worldwide as a direct result of over 11,000 extreme weather events [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. It is well known that carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of global warming. In addition, other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are extremely harmful to public health [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Therefore, in order to protect the environment and public health, carbon emissions need to be reduced as soon as possible. The carbon emission intensity is most closely related to energy consumption. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimated that global energy-related carbon emissions increased by 21% between 2005 and 2017, mainly from Asian countries such as China and India [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Energy-related carbon emissions are expected to remain relatively stable in most regions by 2019, but emissions from China are still increasing [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In June 2015, the Chinese government issued a statement regarding the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC), with a promise to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60% by 2030 compared with 2005 [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In a context characterized by the comprehensive implementation of energy saving and emission reduction measures, energy consumption by industry has begun to achieve negative growth, but the consumption of domestic energy is increasing annually in the industrial sector, and the proportion of energy consumed has increased rapidly since 2010 [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. According to the data in the Energy Statistics Yearbook, the per capita energy consumption by urban residents is much higher than that by rural residents, where the difference is as high as 3.5 times [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In addition, according to the “National New Urbanization Plan 2014–2020” issued by the State Council, the urbanization rate for China’s resident population will increase from 52.6% in 2013 to 60% in 2020 [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], which means that the energy consumption by urban residents will continue to account for most of the overall energy consumed by residents. In addition, at present, China is still in a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Due to the sustained growth of the economy, life in the context of urbanization and the continuous changes in transportation modes mean that the energy consumption by urban residents and the resulting carbon emissions will increase further. Understanding how to exploit the potential low-carbon emission reductions by residents is an important issue for the development of low-carbon economy. Residents are the third largest producers of emissions after the government and enterprises, and thus the motivation and ability to reduce carbon emissions is important for social progress.
