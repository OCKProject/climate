<p class="p">There is a bidirectional interaction between utility experience perception and carbon capability of urban residents. Utility experience perception is a decisive factor that affects the development of the carbon capability. Thus, when the individualâ€™s perception of the outcome of a certain capability tends to be negative, then they consider that the capability does not have any benefit for them, so there is no possibility of carbon capability construction and development. Very few studies have analyzed the impact of utility experience perception on the carbon capability. The meaning of utility experience perception and its relationship with the carbon capability of urban residents was defined mainly according to the results of the in-depth interviews. According to the contents of the interviews, most residents suggested that low-carbon behaviors can reduce economic expenses, bring spiritual satisfaction, protect the environment, and obtain other outcomes. Therefore, we defined the low-carbon consumption behavior as a carrier of the carbon capability, which can lead to utility experience perception, and affect the construction and development of the carbon capability of urban residents. This effect can be positively promoted or reversed, and thus there is a bidirectional interaction between utility experience perception and the carbon capability of urban residents.</p>
