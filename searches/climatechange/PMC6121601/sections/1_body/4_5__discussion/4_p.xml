<p class="p">The low carbon selection cost is an internal situational factor related to the carbon capability of urban residents and by acting as an internal regulatory variable, it exerts a regulatory effect between utility experience perception and the carbon capability. The in-depth interviews showed that many urban residents have not implemented low-carbon behavior, mainly because they feel that low-carbon products are more expensive and they find them inconvenient. If the implementation of a specific low-carbon consumption behavior is very difficult and it causes discomfort in oneâ€™s everyday life, as well as requiring more time and effort, then the possibility of its implementation will be very low, which may counteract the perceived positive utility experience that has been generated. Therefore, the low carbon selection cost acts as an internal regulatory variable with a regulatory effect between utility experience perception and the carbon capability. The individual will evaluate the costs and benefits of an individual behavioral choice before making a decision, and the individual will reject the choice when the cost exceeds a certain level. The cost for an individual choosing a low-carbon behavior includes the cost of selecting and implementing low-carbon consumption behavior, but also the costs of transforming traditional consumption habits and implementing a behavioral choice. These internal situational factors influence the implementation of low-carbon consumption patterns.</p>
