<p class="p">The technological situation and the policy situation are external situational factors that affect the carbon capability of urban residents, and as external regulatory variables, they have regulatory interactive effects between the utility experience perception and the carbon capability. According to behavioral theory, attitudes regarding individual environmental awareness, purchasing, and consumption behavior will be affected by the product price, performance, and convenience [

Therefore, when individuals make a low-carbon consumption decision, their behavior will be affected by the price, performance, and convenience of the product. More comprehensive considerations of low-carbon products should consider their technological maturity, availability, convenience, and other effects. In addition, the degree of policy intervention, validity, and infrastructure improvement also influence individual low-carbon lifestyle choices to a great extent [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. According to the in-depth interviews, many urban residents do not use low-carbon travel modes because the infrastructure is not adequate and many other studies reached a similar conclusion [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Therefore, adequate infrastructure is an important requirement for low-carbon behavior. Moreover, the government should improve the relevant system policies and increase policy support. Based on the results of the in-depth interviews, we identified technological situational factors and policy situational factors as external situational factors that affect the carbon capability of urban residents, such as the technological maturity of products, accessibility, and infrastructure completeness. We also found a regulatory interaction between utility experience perception and the carbon capability.
