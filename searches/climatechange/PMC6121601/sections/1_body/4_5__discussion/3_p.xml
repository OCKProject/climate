<p class="p">Similar to the “attitude behavior” gap, there is a significant gap between utility experience perception and the carbon capability of urban residents. If an individual has a positive utility experience perception, the carbon capability does not necessarily increase. In the interviews, we obtained some data that supported the perception of the utility experience and the generation of the carbon capability in a similar manner to the relationship between behavioral will and behavior. Few studies have investigated the relationships between environmental attitudes (will/intention) and environmental behavior, but most showed that pro-environmental attitudes lead to environmentally friendly behavior [

Some studies found incomplete agreement between environmental attitudes (will/intention) and environmental behavior, but they demonstrated a synergy between environmental attitudes (will/intention) and environmental behavior. For example, a study of the energy use attitude and actual energy use behavior of residents in three regions of Finland found a gap between the two [

Thus, similar to the gap between “attitude and behavior,” we found a clear gap between the construction of the carbon capability of urban residents and the perception of development and the utility experience, which requires further study.
