<p class="p">According to the variables (individual factors, organizational factors, and social factors) that affect the carbon capability, we identified two key drivers based on the in-depth interviews: ecological personality and social currency. These two factors have been considered little in previous studies. (1) Ecological personality. Based on the in-depth interviews with residents and experts, we found that the personality traits of residents can affect the construction and development of their carbon capability, and the acceptance of the ecological environment concept can actually promote the implementation of low-carbon consumption behavior. According to previous studies, personality traits will affect the implementation of individual low-carbon consumption behavior. The ecological and environmental consequences of changes in consumption patterns by ordinary consumers are ultimately limited. We cannot be overly optimistic until the current consumption pattern changes because the deterioration of the ecological environment will continue [

In particular, the ecological personality is not a traditional psychological personality, but instead it can be regarded as an ecological trait. Thus, from the perspective of an ecological civilization, the traditional personality connotation can no longer fully explain individual behavioral changes in an ecological situation, and the specific connotation of personality is changing constantly due to the change from an industrial civilization to an ecological civilization. Therefore, the ecological personality trend is evolving into a necessity [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The ecological personality combines a unique and stable thinking mode, and behavioral style based on the ecological concept and the fusion of the human social mentality and natural ecology [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], which have important effects on the construction and promotion of the carbon capability. (2) Social currency. This factor conforms with Bandura’s social learning theory. According to Bandura’s social learning theory, human behavior is the result of information processing activities and their interactions with internal factors and environmental factors [

Thus, low carbon consumption behavior is a consequence of individual personality, psychological consciousness, and external social factors. In our daily lives, we share various types of information with friends, such as via Weibo (this “MicroBlog” is a social network platform in China for share briefs and real-time messages via an attention mechanism), and the circle of friends allows others to express themselves. If people receive a message that attracts attention and conveys their likes and dislikes regarding low-carbon behavior, then the likelihood of choosing and implementing low-carbon consumption will be greatly increased [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. A message that makes someone feel unique is a form of social currency. Social currency is derived from the concept of social media economics, which measures the tendency of users to share brand-related content. In a study of “content sharing” via Internet social networking, Magdol and Bessel concluded that when people communicate with others, they are not only trying to communicate information because “people also want to spread certain information about themselves” [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Thus, people subconsciously want to “label” themselves by talking to others about what they see as their ideal self, which can be funny, intelligent, strong, beautiful, or rich. Our in-depth interviews demonstrated that social currency is factor that can drive the carbon capability of urban residents.
