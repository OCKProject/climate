<p class="p">(2) Strategies for enhancing the carbon capability based on positive utility experience perception. The carbon capability has a positive influence on utility experience perception, and utility experience perception has a positive effect on the carbon capability, so positively and efficiently enhancing the carbon capability will further enhance and consolidate the carbon capability of urban residents. The government can motivate urban residents by rewarding innovative low-carbon applications, subsidizing low carbon products, and rewarding advanced low-carbon individuals/enterprises in order to stimulate urban residents and help urban residents to build their own carbon capability. The government should spread information to the public about how climate warming is caused by high carbon emissions as well as its impacts on physical and mental health, thereby enhancing the perception of the public. The government should improve the purchase channels and provide guidelines for low-carbon products to ensure that urban residents have positive economic experiences when selecting low-carbon products, thereby enhancing their economic perception of these products. For example, on the consumer side, subsidies should be provided for goods such as energy-saving lamps and new energy automobiles, and the low-carbon preferences of urban residents must be cultivated. Furthermore, by growing the economy, environmental protection, value, and active experiences related to low carbon, we can increase the positive cognition of the carbon capability among residents and help them to build and enhance their own carbon capability.</p>
