<p class="p">(3) Situational factors have significant effects on promoting the utility-related perception of the carbon capability. Positive intervention strategies related to situational factors are required, such as improving economic policies to promote energy conservation and reduce emissions, as well as considering the popularization and implementation of policies. First, the government should innovate methods for popularizing low carbon knowledge and technology by explaining the specific regulations and implementation rules for policies to residents in various forms, and by implementing low-carbon guidance policies that are closely related to the interests of residents. Second, these strategies may include improving the energy saving and emissions reduction investment mechanism and reducing the costs of low carbon selection, improving the maturity of low-carbon technology, implementing low-carbon product projects and improving the low carbon product purchase channel, and constructing adequate infrastructure and increasing its effective supply. In particular, it is necessary to establish unified green product classification standards, certification bodies, and maturity marking systems. In addition, in terms of the infrastructure supply, the government should try to improve the modernization of the infrastructure, promote regional infrastructure development, and accelerate the development of infrastructure with a green low carbon cycle, as well as conducting regular maintenance and upgrading to ensure that the basic living needs of residents are met.</p>
