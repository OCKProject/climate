<p class="p">The theoretical contributions of this study are as follows. (1) We systematically explored the driving factors that affect the urban carbon capability and identified the leading factors related to the carbon capability (individual factors, organizational factors, and social factors), the perception of utility experience, internal situational factors (low carbon selection cost), and external situational factors (policy situation and technical context). (2) Based on this multi-layer exploration of the factors that influence the individual, organization, and society, we constructed a theoretical model of the factors that drive the carbon capability of urban residents, including the mechanism responsible for forming the carbon capability of urban residents, and we suggested that the perception of utility experience is an important individual factor. Organizational factors and social factors are the three main variables that influence the carbon capability, which is regulated by situational factors. The perception of utility can affect the generation and development of the carbon capability, but it can also have the reverse effect on the carbon capability. (3) The multi-layer driving factors identified in this study contribute greatly to carbon capability research. The ecological personality among the individual factors and social currency among the social factors have rarely been investigated in previous studies.</p>
