<p class="p">(1) The integrated construction of a strategy for increasing the carbon capability at the levels of the individual, organization, and society. At the social level, the government should build a positive consumer culture and guide positive social norms. At the organizational level, it is necessary to build the organizational carbon value, create a low-carbon attitude in organizations, and establish low-carbon system norms. At the individual level, the government should build a positive ecological personality and cultivate ecological citizens, as well as improving low-carbon security and guiding rational and comfortable preferences. In order to achieve consistent effects on the individual, organization, and society in the terms of the cultural atmosphere, institutional norms, ecological personality, value orientation, and rational preferences, we need to address the following issues. (1) Governmental aspects such as improving appropriate laws, regulations, and standards of environmental protection, establishing the concept of unified economic development and environmental protection, promoting balanced development, providing ecological education to all people, cultivating ecological citizens, improving the system for environmental information disclosure, enhancing the supervision system, and implementing “carbon-free” operations. (2) Actively encourage low-carbon behavior by enterprises, such as promoting a low-carbon management model, establishing low-carbon guidance system norms, maximizing environmental benefits, improving the technological level of low-carbon products and services, and reducing direct/indirect carbon emissions as much as possible while still satisfying the requirements in terms of comfort for residents. (3) Positively promoting a low-carbon lifestyle among the public, such as encouraging a green diet, green clothing, green living, green travel, and building a low-carbon community.</p>
