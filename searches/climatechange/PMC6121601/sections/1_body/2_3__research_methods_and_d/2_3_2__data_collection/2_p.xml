<p class="p">In previous qualitative studies, face-to-face interviews have often been used to obtain the required information. In this study, in addition to the usual face-to-face interviews, we used the QQ chat platform WeChat chat platform to conduct interviews. QQ chat, which is short for Tencent QQ, is an internet-based instant messaging software. At present, QQ is available for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and other mainstream platforms. QQ supports online chat, video calls, point-to-point breakpoint file continuation, shared files, network hard disk, custom panel, QQ mailbox, and other functions, and it can be connected to a variety of communication terminals. WeChat is also a free messaging service for smart terminals. WeChat supports voice messages, video, images, and text messages, which can be sent free of charge (where a small amount of the network traffic is consumed) over the network across communication operators and across operating system platforms. In this study, voice call, video call, and messaging platforms were used for interviews. Participants were free to choose their preferred platform for the interviews.</p>
