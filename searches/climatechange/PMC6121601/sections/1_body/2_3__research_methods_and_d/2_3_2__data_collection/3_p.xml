<p class="p">This type of online interview has the following advantages: the interviewees do not have to meet with the interviewers directly, which is more convenient in terms of time and space; the interviewees do not feel constrained and they may answer more freely and truthfully; the conversation is not easily influenced by the verbal and behavioral language of the interviewer; and the answers can be more considered and logical. Therefore, we conducted in depth, one-to-one interviews via the QQ and WeChat chat platforms online. In the interviews, we used a method based on questions in a focused interview, where the interviewer set up a participatory dialogue and guided the interviewees to focus on a specific subject from their own point of view. Each in-depth interview lasted about 1 h and sufficient time was allowed for reflection by the interviewees. Before the formal interview, the interviewer first explained the subject and the issues considered with the interviewee via the message platform. The interview was based on the principles of openness, interaction, and confidentiality. According to the requirements of grounded theory, the interviews involved no presuppositions and paradigms, but simple interview outlines were specified in advance (see
