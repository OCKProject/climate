<p class="p">The carbon capability of urban residents is not completely clear at present, and thus it is necessary to conduct exploratory qualitative research. Therefore, the exploratory method employed for data analysis in this study was mainly based on grounded theory. Grounded theory was proposed in 1967 [

In this study, we recorded in-depth interviews with representative urban residents. The core idea of grounded theoretical analysis is continuous comparative analysis, which is embodied in the contents of a document before and after analysis, and between the data. The concepts and category elements related to the research goal can be found via continuous comparative analysis. Attributes can be generalized and the corresponding theory may be constructed from the bottom to the top. The specific steps in grounded theoretical analysis mainly include open coding, axial coding, and selective coding, as shown in
