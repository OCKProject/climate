<p class="p">The interview is the main source of qualitative research data, and thus the conclusions obtained, so the interviewees should be selected carefully. Therefore, the interviewees needed to have some understanding of the carbon capability, and low-carbon related concepts and behaviors. Representative urban residents were identified by combining theoretical sampling with stratified sampling, where the representative residents had some understanding of low-carbon consumption and a certain level of educational knowledge [

We also considered gender, age, occupation, and other variables to ensure that a reasonable sample structure was obtained in accordance with the real situation. After theoretical sampling and stratified sampling, two specific interviews were conducted. The sample size was determined based on the principle of theoretical saturation, i.e., sampling until the new samples no longer provided new important information. After 38 subjects had been interviewed, the answers given in the last three interviews assessed by content analysis were unable to add new information to the study, so the content was saturated. According to this process, 35 participants were identified. The data showed that the sample matched the diversity requirements for the qualitative study, including different genders, ages, regions, and occupational backgrounds. The basic information for the interviewees is shown in
