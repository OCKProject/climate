<p class="p">In the encoding process, axial coding or secondary encoding is also known as associative login or axis login. Axial coding is a key component of grounded theory analysis. The original codes for the objects or concepts generated in the open encoding process are the major focus of the analysis in axial coding. Axial coding follows a coding paradigm comprising: “reason-phenomenon scene-mediation conditions-action/interaction strategy-results” [

This paradigm combines every concept identified in the open coding process to form a main category, as well as developing and testing the relationship among the concepts. It should be noted that the use of an analysis “paradigm” is important because it provides a perspective for viewing the original concept and a heuristic analysis tool to help organize the systematic decentralization of the original concept.
