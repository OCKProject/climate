<p class="p">Axial coding involves the discovery and establishment of various relationships between conceptual categories. In axial coding, researchers only analyze one category at a time by exploring the correlations with this category and analyzing potential correlations between each category at the conceptual level. Therefore, this process is called the “axis” or “spindle.” After analyzing the correlations between each group of categories, we need to recognize the level of the category in the group, i.e., the main category and sub-category, before establishing the relationships between the principal category and sub-categories by continual comparative analysis. The main category identification process (axial coding process) is shown in
