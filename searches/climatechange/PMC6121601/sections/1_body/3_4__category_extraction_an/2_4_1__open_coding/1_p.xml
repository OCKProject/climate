<p class="p">In the encoding process, open coding or first-level coding is also known as open login or level 1 login. During the open coding process, we tried to use the original words of the interviewees as much as possible in order to name the concepts directly or to extract the related concepts, thereby eliminating the effects of prejudice by the individual coder as much as possible. We invited five related professional researchers to organize the data from the interviews and collected 1021 expressions related to the “carbon capability of urban residents.” In order to identify the factors that strongly influence the carbon capability of urban residents, we excluded relatively simple and vague answers from the interview records, and we finally obtained more than 800 original sentences and the corresponding initial concepts. The number of initial concepts was high and there was a certain degree of crossover between them, so the initial concepts with a repetition frequency of more than five times were selected for categorization, and individual contradictory initial concepts were also eliminated at the same time. Open coding commenced after the first interview. In the first interview, some concepts were sorted and the correlations and differences between these concepts were analyzed to yield some final categories. Next, the second interview was conducted by targeting the problems found in the coding process and the sorting of the concept categories. It should be noted that not everyone was interviewed twice. After the first interview, we open coded the collected data. If questions or doubts remained regarding some of the participants, we contacted them to arrange a second interview. This process was required because the numbers of concepts and categories determined by coding were relatively high, and the related concepts and categories were repeated in the coding process, so the interview could not proceed and coding could not reach the next level. 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01607-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> presents the conceptualization and categorization processes based on the original interview records. The categorization results comprised factors related to the carbon capability of urban residents. Considering limitations on space for this article, we only list representative primitive record statements and the initial concepts for each category.
