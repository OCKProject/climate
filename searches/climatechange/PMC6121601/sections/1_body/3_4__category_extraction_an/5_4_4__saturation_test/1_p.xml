 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-01607" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. After sorting the interview records, two-thirds of the interview records were randomly selected for root coding analysis and one-third were tested for grounded theoretical saturation. The coding analysis of the remaining one-third of the interview records was consistent with the above description, where we conducted open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. Information saturation was determined by continuous comparative analysis. The saturation test was complete and the qualitative analysis ended when no new conceptual categories could be found. In this study, the results showed that the categories in the model were sufficiently developed, and no new categories or relationships were found for the main carbon capability categories of urban residents and no new constituent factors were formed within the main categories. Therefore, we consider that the analysis performed in this study was theoretically saturated.
