<p class="p">Based on the analysis described above, we identified the core drivers of the carbon capability in urban residents and analyzed their interactions. The specific driving factors comprised the individual factors, organizational factors, social demographic variables, utility experience perception, policy situation, low carbon choice cost, and technological situation. In addition, based on the typical relationship structure (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot3-ijerph-15-01607" class="xref">Section 4.3</xref>), we determined the core category for the multi-layer factors that drive the carbon capability of urban residents and the policy guidance path. We then developed a new theoretical framework comprising the factors that drive the carbon capability in a theoretical model of the mechanisms that drive the carbon capability of urban residents, as shown in
