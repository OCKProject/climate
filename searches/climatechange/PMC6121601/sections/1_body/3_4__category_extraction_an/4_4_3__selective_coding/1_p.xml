<p class="p">In the coding process, selective coding or three-level coding is also known as core login or selective login. Selective coding is based on applying spindle coding to further identify and systematically analyze the relationships between categories and categories. Selective coding is a form of systematic analysis for identifying the core category from the main category and systematically establishing the connections between the core category and other categories. In the continual comparative analysis process, the core category must be repeatedly identified as dominant in most categories and it should clearly describe the relationships between most categories. Most categories can be included in a theoretical framework with good coverage. After in-depth mining, the typical relationships between the main categories determined by selective encoding are shown in
