   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> The participant begins the experience by listening to an introductory narration and watching short tutorials that describe how he will interact with objects in the underwater environment. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> The participant engages in a “species count.” He refers to the dive slate attached to his virtual left wrist to see which species are on the list, how many he has found already, and how much time is left. The participant is given 2 min to find species in the first healthy underwater zone. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> The participant is transported to an unhealthy zone with higher levels of acidity. He is given another 2 min to conduct a species count in this area.
