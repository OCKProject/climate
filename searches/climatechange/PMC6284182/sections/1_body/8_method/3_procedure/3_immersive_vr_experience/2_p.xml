<p class="p">In the virtual world, participants experienced synchronous environmental feedback designed to make them feel more connected to their self-avatars. Participants saw a fish swim up to their bodies in the virtual world that would begin to repeatedly bump against them. Concurrently, the researcher used a plastic fish on a stick to gently tap the participant on his or her physical body in the same location on their torso as in the virtual world (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). These taps continued for ~30 s, then the fish swam away. Participants heard an audible “tap” sound as the fish bumped them. This synchronized sensory feedback aims to make participants feel a greater sense of embodiment in their self-avatars (Botvinick and Cohen,

Participants' position was tracked in the virtual space using the external Rift infrared sensor but they did not physically walk around.
