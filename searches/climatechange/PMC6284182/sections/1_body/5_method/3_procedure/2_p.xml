<p class="p">In the first introductory meeting, students signed up for the study and participated in a VR demonstration unrelated to ocean acidification or science. This allowed the hardware to be tested outside the lab and ensured that the ocean acidification experience was not the students' first VR exposure, resolving one of Bricken's (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1991</xref>) concerns about the potential fear associated with a first virtual experience. Two weeks later, the research team administered a questionnaire to obtain students' baseline knowledge of ocean acidification. The questionnaire contained inquiries into ocean acidification and the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), a scale to measure attitudes toward the environment. The following day, all students in the class, which included four subjects from our study, went on the first of two open-water scuba diving trips in physical space. This first underwater trip is henceforth referred to as Dive Trip 1 and was introduced to evaluate the potential impact of a physical-world experience on a virtual-world experience. The following week, the research team re-administered the pre-test materials to all participants.
