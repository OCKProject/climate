<p class="p">All questions were scored independently by two coders, who were instructed to grade the responses based on accuracy. Consistent with prior work (Minogue et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), responses were ranked on a point system: zero points for no answer or simply restating the question, one point for a partially correct answer, and two points if the answer contained nearly perfect accuracy with minor inaccuracies. As expected, average ocean acidification knowledge during the pre-test time blocks (Time 1 and 2 in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) was low, [(
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 1.97, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 1.43); min = 0, max = 5.0], compared to the average ocean acidification knowledge during the final three time blocks, [(
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 4.62, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 2.52); min = 0.5, max = 10.5]. Inter-rater reliability for these judgments was high (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and examples of ideal answers are provided in the Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">A</xref>. Note, because there were six questions, knowledge scores could have reached a maximum of twelve points.
