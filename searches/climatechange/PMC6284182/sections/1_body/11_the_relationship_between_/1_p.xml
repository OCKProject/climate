<p class="p">What do our studies reveal about the relationship between media and learning? The Interactive Information Processing Model by Tremayne and Dunwoody (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>) suggests when people use media interactively, they engage in more elaborative cognitive processing than people who use media passively. For example, people who use interactive websites that allow clicking on links engage in deeper cognitive processing and appraise their mediated experience more positively than people who use sites that only allow scrolling (Sicilia et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; see also Xu and Sundar, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, participants who explored more of the virtual space formed deeper cognitive associations with the science content and could learn, recall, and retain the causes and effects of ocean acidification better than those who did not explore the underwater world as much. We suspect that the strong learning effects in immersive VR reflect the medium's unique ability to fully engage a subject in an experience and surround him or her with the feeling of non-mediation (Slater and Wilbur, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>), but also believe that it is important to explore how immersive VR compares to other media in its potential to facilitate learning about science.
