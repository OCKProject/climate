<p class="p">VR disciplines have a rich history of documenting the medium's role as an important tool to evaluate social and psychological phenomena. For example, VR assists medical fields with patient rehabilitation and psychological interventions (Nilsson et al.,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), and other fears (e.g., spiders, flying, heights) show consistent or enhanced levels of psychological improvement relative to traditional, face-to-face treatments. Medicine, as well as other fields (e.g., athletics; Bideau et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) have also used virtual technology for teaching and training because repetitions in VR are free. It is often financially and ethically expensive for doctors, trainers, or nurses to practice on humans, but VR offers rehearsals that feel real and are relatively low-cost. Cadavers can cost hospitals thousands of dollars and harming a living person has non-trivial consequences, including in extreme cases, death. VR allows doctors to move within a space that imitates their physical environment with carryover effects that can positively impact operating room performance (Seymour et al.,
