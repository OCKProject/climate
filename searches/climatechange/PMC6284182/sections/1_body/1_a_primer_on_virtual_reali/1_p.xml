<p class="p">VR is a communication medium that leads an individual to perceive experiences and environments as if they were not synthetic (Lombard and Ditton, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). A virtual experience hinges on two critical dimensions: immersion and presence. Immersion considers how well the technology approximates actions and movements in the virtual space. For example, a highly immersive experience tracks a person's arms or legs with high levels of accuracy and maps his or her movements to the virtual space in a natural way. Presence, on the other hand, is the psychological sense of “being there” (Heeter, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>; Slater and Wilbur, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). Presence reflects how well an individual perceives the self in the virtual world and has the opportunity to act within the space (Wirth et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Together, an immersive virtual experience with high levels of presence allows the individual to suspend any belief that the experience is mediated.
