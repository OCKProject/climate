<p class="p">Since the 1990's VR has been tested and used as a tool for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. According to Salzman et al. (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>), learning in VR is possible because VR systems produce highly engaging experiences, which can lead to greater focus on the learning topic (Bricken and Byrne, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). VR puts users within a virtual learning environment that reflects the topic of interest (e.g., placing students within a cell if they are learning about human biology), which can offer perspectives that are difficult to realize in other learning settings (see Johnson et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). VR can be effective for learning because it enables “users to interact with spatial representations” from many frames of reference (Salzman et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>, p. 294). Finally, the addition of auditory, haptic, and other sensory feedback allows users participate in a world that feels unmediated. Such features provide a multidimensional experience that can aid in cognitive processing and information retention (Ragan et al.,
