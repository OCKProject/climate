<p class="p">An extensive review of the research on educational virtual environments by Mikropoulos and Natsis (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) suggests that most VR programs are consistent with River City, using desktop or non-immersive technology for learning (e.g., computers, styluses, joysticks). For example, Minogue et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) gave middle school students a desktop VR program to explore the details of a cell. In the treatment group, students received visual and haptic feedback as they explored a virtual cell and the control group only received visual feedback. The data revealed positive learning effects for students in both groups after comparing pre- to post-test knowledge scores about cells. Haptic feedback improved knowledge scores for some low-achieving students, but overall, it did not lead to learning differences between groups.
