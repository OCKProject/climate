<p class="p">A classic example of VR developed for learning about science was created by Dede (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The program's goal is to teach students about the scientific method by progressing through different parts of the city. Students develop research questions about why River City is experiencing health issues or why people are getting sick at uneven rates. Participants move through the curriculum by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting science data.
