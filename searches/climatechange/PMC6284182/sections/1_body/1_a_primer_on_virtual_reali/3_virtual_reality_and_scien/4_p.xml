<p class="p">The prior patterns have been summarized at scale in a recent meta-analysis that evaluated the effect of desktop VR instruction on learning and knowledge gain (Merchant et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Across nearly 30 studies, Merchant et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) observed that desktop VR interventions produce a significant, positive effect on leaning outcomes and knowledge gain in K-12 higher education. We use this meta-analytic evidence as support for the idea that instruction through predominantly desktop VR is effective and can lead to positive knowledge gain for many science topics. It is still unclear, however, if immersive VR can facilitate learning about complex social and environmental issues.
