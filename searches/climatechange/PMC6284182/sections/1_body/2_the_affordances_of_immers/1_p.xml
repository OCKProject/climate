<p class="p">An experience in immersive VR should lead to positive learning effects for several reasons. From a technical perspective, immersive VR hardware creates a sensory experience that surrounds a user. Immersive VR is characterized by the use of a Head Mounted Display (HMD), enhanced with auditory, haptic, or other sensory feedback to give the virtual world a genuine look and feel (Ahn et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, the virtual world is perceived as unmediated and people often respond to stimuli as they would outside of a virtual world. Immersive VR also affords situated action, or the ability for people to move and act within a novel setting. Situated action can facilitate knowledge gain because learning occurs in the environment of interest (e.g., learning about ocean acidification occurs while placed virtually underwater) and people can actively engage with the environment (e.g., move arms or legs in the virtual space; Gallagher, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). This idea is rooted in embodied cognition research (Clark, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>), which generally suggests that people can develop strong social and psychological attachments to an environment by interacting and moving within it. That is, people can learn, form more positive associations toward a stimulus, and internalize information by acting in a space and performing motions that are relevant to a specific context relative to simply internalizing information about a phenomenon (Weisberg and Newcombe, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). This rationale is also supported by media interactivity theories such as the Interactive Information Processing Model (Tremayne and Dunwoody, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). This framework suggests that interactivity with media, elaborative cognitive processing, and information recall are positively associated, which can also extend to virtual worlds as well. Therefore, interacting with an immersive virtual environment can lead to deeper cognitive processing and data retention for complex information such as ocean acidification.
