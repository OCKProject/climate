<p class="p">In a different laboratory study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three VR systems (e.g., a system similar to the CAVE, a HMD system with tracking, a HMD system without tracking) and or a non-VR control system to learn about four topics: astronomy, transportation, networking, and inventors (Alhalabi, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Learning was assessed by quizzes on these topics and the results suggest that any form of VR leads to more positive learning outcomes relative to no VR. Another study evaluated if the cognitive modifiability of young children, defined as the capacity to adapt and adjust to complexity, was affected by the medium that they learned how to recall the orientation, position, and other characteristics of blocks (Passig et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Children who were assigned to an immersive VR condition, relative to desktop VR, tangible blocks, or control conditions, demonstrated greater cognitive modifiability, which is evidence of enhanced analytic thinking. Finally, prior work also suggests that an experience in immersive VR can lead to more positive learning gains relative to lecture-based instruction for United States soldiers, who were educated on military procedures pertaining to corrosion prevention and control (Webster,
