<p class="p">To understand the consequences of ocean acidification, scientists have observed naturally occurring sources of sub-oceanic carbon dioxide produced by underwater volcanic vents, for example one site near the coast of Ischia, Italy. The underwater processes in this region provide scientists with a “crystal ball” to see what will happen to oceans as more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere (Hall-Spencer et al.,

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Despite the severity of the problem and the well-supported research behind it, ocean acidification knowledge remains low and the phenomenon receives far less public attention than other climate change issues in environmental education (Kroeker et al.,

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The natural case study of ocean acidification in Ischia Italy, paired with recent calls for innovative methods that emphasize behavior and attitude change to improve environmental education (McCright et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wu and Lee,
