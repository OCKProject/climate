<p class="p">We investigated the effectiveness of immersive VR for learning about marine science through virtual field trips, a common metaphor for learning experiences in a virtual world (Borst et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Our first study started at a high school in the West Coast of the United States. In immersive VR, students participated in activities based on traditional practices of marine scientists, who dive underwater and interact with species of flora and fauna to measure biodiversity. The underwater virtual world was modeled after the Ischian Reef in Italy, where naturally occurring carbon dioxide vents acidify certain areas of the reef and provide scientists with a window into a future affected by climate change. We were primarily interested in the effect of immersive VR—characterized by haptic, auditory, and other sensory feedback experienced throughout a virtual world (Ahn et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>)—on the students' learning and knowledge gain about ocean acidification. Our subsequent studies were exploratory and tested the effect of embodiment (Study 2), movement (Study 3), and situated action (Study 4) on learning gains or an interest in learning about climate change.
