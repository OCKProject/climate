<p class="p">There are several distinct contributions of this paper that go beyond the reported learning effects. First, Study 1 serves as an initial proof of concept that immersive VR can deliver complex scientific information to young adults in classrooms. Increased learning likely occurred because the abstract and distant effects of ocean acidification were brought psychologically closer to participants (Trope and Liberman,
