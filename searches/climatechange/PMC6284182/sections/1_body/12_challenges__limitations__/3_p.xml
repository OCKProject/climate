<p class="p">In addition to exploring information retention, immersive VR should be compared to other media to evaluate the boundary conditions for learning about marine science. Some research suggests that learning about science through a HMD produces similar learning levels as desktop VR (Moreno and Mayer, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), but it is important to position immersive VR relative to other innovative teaching platforms and approaches. For example, it is unclear how immersive VR compares to mobile games for learning (Wu and Lee, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the portable nature of mobile communication may facilitate a different learning potential about science. Therefore, a fruitful line of research we intend to conduct will investigate several teaching methods to isolate the technologies that best support student learning about complex social and scientific issues.
