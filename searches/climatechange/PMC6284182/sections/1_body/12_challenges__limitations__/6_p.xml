<p class="p">The future of using immersive VR for education is promising, though we do not expect the technology to replace teachers, just like Massive Open Online Courses have not replaced universities or in-person lectures. However, immersive VR has the potential to provide unique opportunities for education and to reach students with special learning needs. As such, we strategically positioned the studies and experiences in this paper as field trips (Borst et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Students do not participate in field trips every day, but only on special occasions and for more hands-on, experiential learning. We therefore can see the immediate potential of immersive VR for tutoring and classrooms that need topical reinforcement. For example, students struggling in chemistry can go deeper into the material and learn about the composition of elements first-hand in immersive VR. We currently view immersive VR as a medium to supplement the conventional learning environment, not replace it.
