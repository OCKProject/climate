<p class="p">There were several significant, positive relationships between post-test scores (see Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Presence was positively associated with post-test levels of ocean acidification knowledge (ρ = 0.34, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.019), ratings on the CNS (ρ = 0.47, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and NEP scales (ρ = 0.46, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001). Therefore, the more that people reported being attuned to the virtual environment in the post-test, the more that they learned in immersive VR, felt connected to nature, and reported environmental concern. Correlations between measures that are calculated based on the change between pre- and post-test scores can be found in Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">B</xref>; as expected, they show largely the same pattern as post-test correlations alone.
