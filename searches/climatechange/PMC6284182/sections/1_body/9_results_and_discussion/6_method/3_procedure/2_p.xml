<p class="p">The VR experience began on a virtual boat floating above an Ischian Reef (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). Participants first viewed and responded to the informed consent. A series of narratives and infographics then trained each participant on their task, which was to swim underwater by moving their arms in a breaststroke motion and find marine life to measure the biodiversity of the reef. The immersive VR scene brought participants to the first underwater zone, modeled around a healthy rocky reef. Participants were asked to locate three different underwater animal species (snails, octopi, and eel) as part of a “species count,” an activity modeled after biodiversity assessments that marine biologists conduct in the field. For the next 2 min, participants used their arms to swim around the virtual underwater reef looking for the species of animals and collecting as many as they could find by picking them up with their hand controllers and placing them into a bucket located at the reef's center. A dive slate—modeled after the slates used by marine biologists—attached to each participant's virtual left wrist, displayed the remaining time, and how many of each species had been collected.
