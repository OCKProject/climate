<p class="p">The experiment, including consent procedure, was a self-contained 8 min experience. The embedded informed consent procedure was approved by our university's Institutional Review Board. Pre-recorded narratives for this field trip, recorded by an expert voice-actor, were played through noise-canceling stereo headphones and guided the participants throughout the experience. To display text and visual information, we used virtual information boards. Participants responded to the experimental questions by placing their hands inside virtual choice-boxes and clicking a button on the HTC Vive controllers to select answers to written prompts that appeared within the virtual environment.</p>
