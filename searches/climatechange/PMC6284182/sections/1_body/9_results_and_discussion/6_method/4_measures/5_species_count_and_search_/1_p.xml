<p class="p">We counted the number of species that each participant grabbed during the underwater experience [(
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 10.22; 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 14.17), min = 0, max = 116.0]. This measure differed, however, from the number of species that participants put into their collection buckets [(
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 3.90; 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 3.57), min = 0, max = 21]. These items were highly correlated (œÅ = 0.74, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and we therefore combined these scores into a standardized index called 
 <italic class="italic">search activity</italic> to evaluate participant overall interactivity level during the species count.
