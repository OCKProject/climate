<p class="p">The experimenter explained the immersive VR hardware for viewing and interacting with the virtual world. Depending on the participant's experimental condition for moving underwater, they were provided with Wiimote controls or given instructions for swimming with their hands. Participants then wore the HMD and began their VR experience. A pre-recorded narrative guided subjects throughout the experience at an adjusted level of ambient audio clarity. To ensure familiarity with the underwater world, participants had a 1 min training session to practice locomotion techniques and collect flora and fauna in a virtual underwater zone. Subjects also answered a question that asked about the current temperature since the last time they responded, an exploratory measure that assessed if exposure to climate change effects can modify perceptions about one's environment.</p>
