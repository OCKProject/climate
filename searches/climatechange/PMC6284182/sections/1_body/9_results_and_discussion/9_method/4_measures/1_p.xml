<p class="p">Consistent with our prior studies, we asked questions about ocean acidification and administered the CNS, NEP, and presence scales. We also evaluated the total distance traveled underwater as a gauge of interactivity in the virtual environment. Finally, other exploratory measures such as the perceived room temperature and ratings of simulator sickness (Kennedy et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>) were investigated (for these ancillary measures, see Appendix
