<p class="p">We did not have granular data from Study 3 on the types of movements that predicted inquisitiveness with the right hand.

Specifically, we evaluated if knowledge gain and attitude change are affected by two locomotion techniques: (1) swimming by using physical arm movements as gestures, and (2) swimming by using a joystick (e.g., the Wiimote, based on the Nintendo Wii gaming console).</p>
