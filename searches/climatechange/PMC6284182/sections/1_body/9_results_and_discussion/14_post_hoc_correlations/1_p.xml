<p class="p">Consistent with the evidence in Study 2, Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> suggests that participants' self-reported presence was significantly correlated with CNS scores (ρ = 0.32, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.035) and NEP scores (ρ = 0.41, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.007). Further, reported levels of presence were positively correlated with the average attitude measure (ρ = 0.44, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004). These data suggest that the more the participants felt they were a part of the underwater experience, the stronger they felt concerned about the effects of climate change and ocean acidification.
