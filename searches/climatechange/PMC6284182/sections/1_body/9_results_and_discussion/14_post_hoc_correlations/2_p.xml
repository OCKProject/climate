<p class="p">Crucially, participants' knowledge improvement about ocean acidification (e.g., the change from pre- to post-test ocean acidification knowledge scores) was positively correlated with the total number of snails found across zones (ρ = 0.35, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.022) and total distance traveled underwater (ρ = 0.40, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.008), suggesting that visual exploration and overall activity may lead to greater change in ocean acidification knowledge. This potential mechanism is discussed below.
