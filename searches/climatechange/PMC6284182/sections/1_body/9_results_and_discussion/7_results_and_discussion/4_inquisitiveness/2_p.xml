<p class="p">Consistent with our layered analytic approach, we then ran three separate logistic regression models for each body part's movement (e.g., head, left hand, right hand) and concurrent rotation as independent predictors. The data revealed that the total physical movement of the participant's right hand, proxied by the movement of the virtual right-hand model, significantly predicted inquisitiveness [(β = 0.54, 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 0.25); Wald = 4.74, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.029, Exp(β) = 1.71; 95% CI for Exp(β) [1.06, 2.77]. Physical total rotation of the right hand was marginally associated with inquisitiveness, [
