<p class="p">The data suggest that participant right hand movements can predict if people want to learn more about climate change. How can right hand movements predict inquisitiveness? Prior work suggests that people often process information differently based on the side of their physical body that is completing an action (Casasanto, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Bailey et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This idea is called processing fluency (Reber et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), with evidence suggesting that making one hand inaccessible (e.g., wearing a bulky ski glove on one hand) changes how people perceive the space (e.g., the side that is accessible is viewed more positively than the side that is inaccessible; Casasanto and Chrysikou, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). It is plausible that people with more right-handed movements also were inquisitive because they enjoyed the virtual experience and formed a positive association with it. This contention is worth exploring more directly in future work.
