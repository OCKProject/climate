<p class="p">Based on the prior evidence suggesting that right-hand movements can predict inquisitiveness, we analyzed the data for other 
 <italic class="italic">post-hoc</italic> relationships. The point-biserial correlation between inquisitiveness and attitude toward the closeness of ocean acidification revealed a positive relationship (ρ = 0.19, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.014). The exact direction of this effect is unclear, however, because it is plausible that the more people believe climate change is an immediate threat, the more they may be interested in learning about the issue. On the other hand, if people report being inquisitive about climate change, they may also feel like the issue is impending. Further research is required to understand this effect more clearly. Finally, we found that participants' total body movement (ρ = 0.34, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and rotation (ρ = 0.47, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with total search activity (e.g., total species grabbed and collected in the species count). All correlations for this study's key variables are located in Table
