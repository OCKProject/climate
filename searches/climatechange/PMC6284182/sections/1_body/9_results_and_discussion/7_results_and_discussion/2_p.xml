<p class="p">We used a layered analytic approach to isolate if movement or rotation predict attitude and inquisitiveness. First, we combined the total movement of the head and two hands into a single predictor, 
 <italic class="italic">total physical movement</italic>, and the total rotation of the head and two hands into a single predictor, 
 <italic class="italic">total physical rotation</italic>. If statistically significant, these global variables were then isolated by body part (head, two separate hands) to discover how movement and rotation of specific body features predict attitude and inquisitiveness.
