<p class="p">The current paper creates learning content and implements the idea of taking virtual field trips to begin to address these challenges. Specifically, we test whether people can learn about the consequences of climate change in immersive VR. Our interest in climate change education stems from the importance of bringing complex issues closer to people psychologically (Schuldt et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and is also inspired by recent calls for innovative teaching methods to address environmental concerns (e.g., mobile games; McCright et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wu and Lee, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this spirit, we present two laboratory experiments and two field studies that demonstrate how an immersive VR experience can facilitate learning or an interest in learning about climate change.
