<p class="p">Our study began with a collaboration that involved two high school science teachers, who co-organized an immersive VR experience that allowed students to experience the effects of ocean acidification in their own classroom. This VR experience was originally developed based on work by prior researchers and adapted for our research design (Kroeker et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Over 6 months, teachers and researchers met to develop the VR experience in an iterative process, involving multiple revisions of both the VR experience and the learning measures. We collaboratively identified four main design goals: (1) 
 <italic class="italic">physical immersion</italic>, or making the virtual world of the ocean ecosystem appear to visually surround the learner in space, (2) 
 <italic class="italic">embodiment</italic>, where students should have the sense of feeling present in a virtual body connected to the ecosystem, (3) 
 <italic class="italic">natural interactions</italic>, or the idea that the students should interact with the underwater world in a manner that felt unmediated, and (4) 
 <italic class="italic">time travel</italic>, or the ability for students to see the accelerated effects of ocean acidification on the world around them.
