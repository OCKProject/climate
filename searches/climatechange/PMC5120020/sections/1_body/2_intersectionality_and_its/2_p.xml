<p class="p">Uptake of intersectional conceptualizations within research on global climate change is only just beginning. Kaijser and Kronsell (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2014</xref>) provide a broad theoretical overview of how intersectional understandings relate to climate change and introduce a number of sensitizing questions that can be implemented to critically approach power relations within climate change research. These questions, such as “Are there any observable explicit or implicit assumptions about social categories and about relations between social categories?” and “Are any other aspects of identity neglected or deemed insignificant?” seek to go beyond conventional framings to help illuminate relevant aspects of identity that may currently be overlooked (Kaijser and Kronsell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2014</xref>, pp. 429–430).
