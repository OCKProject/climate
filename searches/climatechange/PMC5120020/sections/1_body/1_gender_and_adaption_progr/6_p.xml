<p class="p">Current works on the connections between gender, agriculture, environment, and development have largely moved past ecofeminism’s original essentializing connections between women and nature (Cornwall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2007</xref>; Leach 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2007</xref>). This work has built on that of Agrawal and others and has moved toward investigating how the roles of women in agrarian settings often position them in unique relationships with agroecosystems in terms of resource use, land ownership, and tenure (e.g., Babugura et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, to date, the bulk of this work continues to rely heavily on inquiry framed around simple conceptualizations of gender. These conceptualizations most often take one of the two forms, those that conflate “gender” to mean “women,” i.e., the “add women and stir” conceptualization (Harding 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">1995</xref>), or those that conflate “gender” to mean “men versus women.” Each of these conceptualizations problematically holds the potential to reduce an incredibly diverse dimension of identity into a uniform box-ticking opportunity. As Cornwall and Rivas (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>, p. 399) put it: “Relegating gender to a descriptive home is an attractive option for those who want to talk the gender talk in the absence of real debates about power.” Power is often missing from these conceptualizations of gender, which mask questionable assumptions that can be observed through, for example, the continued use of the categories of “men” and “women” as explanatory categories for variations in vulnerability without supporting empirical evidence. In such cases, outdated, a priori assumptions of 
 <italic class="italic">men/less vulnerable, women/more vulnerable</italic> are relied upon without further investigation of nuanced sources of vulnerability (Pelling and High

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2006</xref>; Paavola and Adger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2006</xref>; Reid and Vogel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2006</xref>). The principal problem for adaptation programming is that this framing only scratches the surface about the roles and responsibilities that yield observed patterns of vulnerability to climate change. Moreover, this reliance on superficial categories can lead to equally superficial results that fall short of informing more effective adaptation strategies.
