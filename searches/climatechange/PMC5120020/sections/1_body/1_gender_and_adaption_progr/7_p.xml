<p class="p">A large portion of todayâ€™s climate change adaptation and development work attempts to capture a broad assemblage of social characteristics such as gender, age, income, education level, land ownership, and others related to formal and informal institutions, in their vulnerability analyses (Fisher

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, such data collection often still relies upon a priori assumptions about what different identities mean in a given place, and what vulnerabilities those identities produce in particular places. This tendency can be seen in studies that employ approaches and methods ranging from rapid rural appraisals (Patt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2009</xref>; Winowiecki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2014</xref>) using tools including community surveys, participatory focus groups, household level surveys, to randomized control trials (Banerjee and Duflo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2009</xref>; Karlan and Zinman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2011</xref>) that principally gather primary information from local populations and key actors. Such research serves important purposes, for example, by highlighting important instances of inequality and marginalization. However, when carried out without strategic attention to intersecting influences of identity, the explanatory value of such methods for understanding differential vulnerabilities can only fall short of what could potentially be accomplished through engagement with more recent feminist scholarship that fosters exploration of multiple intersections of identities, knowledge, power, and agency. Although there are a number of highly relevant and impactful facets of this scholarship, in the next section we take the opportunity to examine one, intersectionality, more closely with regard to its potential contributions to adaptation in agrarian settings.
