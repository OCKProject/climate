 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015b</xref>) as part of efforts to better understand the needs for various forms of weather and climate information in agrarian settings.

Multiple methods are encompassed within this approach including literature review, semi-structured interviews, household surveys, and participant observation.
