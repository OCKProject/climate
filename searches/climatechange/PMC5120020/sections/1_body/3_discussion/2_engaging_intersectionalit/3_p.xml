<p class="p">Currently, research is emerging that integrates a deeper interrogation of power and intersectionality, with a focus on the convergences of socialâ€“ecological dimensions. For example, in a recent collection of political ecology works on water resource issues and environmental change (Buechler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2015</xref>). Kambic (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>) uses discourse analysis to explore power and influence at the intersections of gender social class and geographic location in the context of urban Los Angeles water systems. Another example from human geography and political ecology can be found in the work of Nightingale (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>) who uses intersectional framings to explore symbolic ideas of difference and how these ideas translate into material realities through everyday decisions and behaviors that involve the use of agricultural and forest resources in Nepal. More recently, Evans (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2016</xref>) used a feminist ethnographic methodology encompassing purposive and snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and participatory workshops to examine the intersections of gender, religion, ethnicity, marital position, status, and generation with socio-ecological change to better understand shifting inheritance practices among the Serer ethnic group in Senegal. Regarding climate change adaptation or resilience of systems specifically, calls for more meaningful engagement with intersectionality work in political ecology and feminist geography are increasing (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2014</xref>); however, the application of intersectional approaches situated in social-ecological perspectives remains quite thin.
