<p class="p">Today, for agrarian settings in the Global South, predictions regarding the impacts of climate variability and change are particularly alarming. Uncertain futures of increased variability in the amount, duration, and distribution of precipitation will likely produce place-specific challenges, such as lengthier droughts, more intense flooding, and increasingly widespread pests and diseases (chapters 22 and 24 in IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>). At times, these impacts will play out as 
 <italic class="italic">distinct</italic> vulnerabilities, where portions of the population have a different exposure to a particular climate stressor (Carr and Thompson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>). In other cases, these impacts may produce 
 <italic class="italic">differentiated</italic> vulnerabilities, where an entire population shares the same exposure to a climate stressor, but have different sensitivities and adaptive capacities with regard to that stressor (Carr and Thompson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>). It is the deeper unpacking of how these differences in sensitivities and adaptive capacities come about, how they are sustained, and what the implications of these are for resilience in overall dynamic systems that are a critical point of exploration for advancing the body of knowledge on climate change adaptation.
