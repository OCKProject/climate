<p class="p">Resilience frameworks examine the capability of a system to flexibly maintain the ability to respond to anticipated and unanticipated changes and stressors without compromising its ability to function or its ability to react and transform (Walker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2006</xref>; Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2011</xref>). In the context of climate change, the collective ability of social actors and ecological components to adapt to particular impacts shapes the overall resilience of social–ecological systems where adaptation is understood as the “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects” (IPCC IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>, p. 5). In order to better understand this collective ability and to identify opportunities for improving adaptation strategies and interventions, it is necessary to look more closely at the composition of vulnerability for particular places, people, and ecosystems. This composition has been identified as reflecting exposure to change, sensitivity (i.e., susceptibility to be harmed by change), and adaptive capacity (i.e., possessing the tools and resources for dealing with change as well as the ability to use those for adaptation) (Nelson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2007</xref>; IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>). Investigation of the complex origins of differential types and degrees of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity associated with diverse groups of people and unique locations (including gendered dimensions) has a deep-rooted history that spans a number of disciplines. Take, for example, the early 1990s work of Liverman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">1990</xref>) that explored different dimensions of vulnerability to global environmental change. Also, notably, the political ecology explorations of Peet and Watts (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2004</xref>), where critical examination was given to a compilation of cases that illuminate structural sources of differential environmental vulnerabilities. Early examples from hazards studies can be found in the work of Adger (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1999</xref>) on social vulnerability to climate change and extremes, or the work of Turner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2003</xref>) on differential vulnerabilities to hazards. Feminist geographers such as Joni Seager (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">1993</xref>), Fordham (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1998</xref>), and host of others have further pushed a critical gendered lens within this scholarship.
