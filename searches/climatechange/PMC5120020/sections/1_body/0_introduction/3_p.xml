<p class="p">While current literature on supporting and facilitating adaptation in agrarian settings increasingly acknowledges that complex social factors can influence how impacts of climate change affect different people in particular ways (Adger

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ribot 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2011</xref>), within practice the inclusion of these factors into research and initiatives focused on adaptation remains superficial and based on outdated assumptions about identity and its associations with vulnerability (Carr and Thompson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, those that presume that only men are the farmers in families or communities (Demetriades and Esplen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>) or that blindly promote the idea that in any given agrarian context women tend to be the most poor and most vulnerable (Jackson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">1998</xref>; Chant 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2010</xref>). Intersectional framings, however, give deeper attention to multiple facets of farmer identities and the way these facets come together to influence vulnerability of different people. Such framings can open new opportunities for building more robust understandings of dynamic assemblages of power and institutions and how these assemblages shape sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We seek to untangle how intersectional framings relate to, and could be more effectively used to support adaptation planning and programming. A goal of this paper therefore, is to provide a review of this topic for researchers and practitioners working outside of the social sciences, or outside of the fields of feminist and gender studies, to better gauge how perspectives from these lines of work can be utilized to support more legitimate and useful adaptation actions and, in turn, increase resilience of agroecosystems in the Global South.
