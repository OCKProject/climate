<p class="p">Vulnerability to climate change has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as “the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In considering the perspective of scenarios of climatic anomalies vulnerability may be regarded as a possibility of “future damage” [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. There is a consensus that vulnerability is a complex and dynamic phenomenon and that several characteristics of a given social-ecological system contribute to make people and territories more or less vulnerable [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. These characteristics can be grouped as being related to the exposure, the sensitivity, or the adaptive capacity of the system being exposed [
