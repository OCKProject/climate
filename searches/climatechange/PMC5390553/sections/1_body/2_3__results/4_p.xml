<p class="p">In regard to the IHV 4.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>) a large group of more vulnerable municipalities was found in the eastern part of the state. There are also clusters of highly vulnerable municipalities in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Minas Gerais. These are regions with HDI ranging from medium to high [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and, as observed in the present study, their municipalities ranked as less vulnerable in the classification of the “General Vulnerability” Index (excluding the climatic scenarios). However, the scenarios for climate anomalies have shown a more intense change for these regions both for the 4.5 and the 8.5 scenarios (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>). These regions are also known historically for a high incidence of natural disasters (storms; floods) due to their mountainous topography and a reduced natural vegetation cover [
