<p class="p">The present study shows an Index of Human Vulnerability at the municipal level, under two climatic scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The RCP scenarios, used by the IPCC, are related to the radiative forcing over the earth's surface, as measured in Watts/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (4.5 and 8.5â€‰W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The RCP 4.5 assumes a less severe scenario of warming, when compared to the RCP 8.5.
