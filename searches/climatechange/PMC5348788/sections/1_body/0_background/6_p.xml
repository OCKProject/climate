<p class="p">Some other studies have evaluated expected advances for integrated 1G2G process in Brazil. Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) of prospective 1G and 1G2G scenarios (2020–2030) compared to current ethanol production. Jonker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>] evaluated economic results for different biomass crops and industrial technologies considering 2010 and 2030 scenarios. This study showed that ethanol production costs decrease over time due to increase of industrial scale, biomass yield, and industrial efficiency. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] performed an economic and GHG emission analysis of sugarcane ethanol production considering the projections for 2010–2020 period, with most parameters based on literature. Results indicated that the combined production cost of 1G and 2G ethanol can be significantly reduced over time, being comparable to 1G cost in 2020. A similar trend was observed for climate change impacts.
