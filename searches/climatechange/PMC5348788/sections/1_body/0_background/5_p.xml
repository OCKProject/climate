<p class="p">Techno-economic and environmental assessments have been increasingly used to compare different process configurations for 2G ethanol production, including combination of pretreatments, variation in enzyme dosages, alternative pentoses utilization, among others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Evaluation of sugarcane biorefineries considering target yields of 2G process showed that an integrated 1G2G plant can be more profitable than a 1G plant. Also, utilization of pentoses for ethanol production instead of biodigestion is an important driver for the reduction in production costs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. In terms of environmental impacts, Dias et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>] showed that high consumption of chemicals in 2G process, e.g., in the delignification step, can increase climate change impacts compared to 1G ethanol production process.
