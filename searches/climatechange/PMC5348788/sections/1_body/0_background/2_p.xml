<p class="p">Ethanol is conventionally produced through first-generation (1G) process, based on the conversion of extractable sugars and starch (mostly from sugarcane and corn, respectively). The 1G ethanol production from sugarcane in Brazil is a consolidated large-scale process. This experience is based on a 40-year experience motivated by the creation of PROALCOOL program in the 1970s. The learning curve of 1G sugarcane ethanol has shown that significant reductions in production cost were achieved over the years, due to the gains in agricultural and industrial yields and to the increase in the scale of production [
