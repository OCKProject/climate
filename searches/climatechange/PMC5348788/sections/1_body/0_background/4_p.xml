<p class="p">Even though 2G ethanol has reached commercial scale with a few plants installed worldwide, including two commercial plants in Brazil that recently started operation (2014/2015), this process is still at the beginning of its technological learning curve [

In Brazil, special credit lines for research and development (R&amp;D) on biomass conversion and for the construction of 2G ethanol plants were available within the PAISS initiativeâ€”joint plan for supporting industrial technological innovation in the sugar-based energy and chemical sectors [
