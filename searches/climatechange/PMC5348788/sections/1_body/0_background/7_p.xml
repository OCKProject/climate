<p class="p">However, these studies projecting 2G technologies were based on literature and without a set of scenarios representing a continuous learning curve for both 1G and 2G ethanol production processes. In this work, production costs and climate change impacts for 1G and 2G ethanol were quantified considering the technological and economic projections between 2015 and 2030. The projections considered improvements not only of industrial processes but also of biomass production systems (e.g., inclusion of energy cane as feedstock). It is important to highlight that these scenarios were set up and discussed with specialists from main companies and stakeholders, from Brazil and abroad, involved in the lignocellulosic ethanol production chain. The objective was to forecast the technological learning curve for both 1G and 2G ethanol production processes, including both biomass production and industrial conversion, and to quantify economic and environmental impacts of present and future technologies for ethanol production. These results can support the proposition of research programs and public policies to stimulate both production and consumption of 2G ethanol in Brazil.</p>
