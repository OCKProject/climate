<p class="p">The configuration of 2G process was based on steam explosion pretreatment, pentoses (C5 sugars) liquor separation, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation of hexoses (C6 sugars) along with 1G juice. Fermentation of pentoses is carried out separately from C6 and 1G juice. After fermentation, both alcoholic streams are sent to a series of distillation columns and dehydration processes where anhydrous ethanol (99.6 wt%) is obtained. Lignin-rich residual solids from enzymatic hydrolysis are burnt in the CHP as supplementary fuel. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows a representation of the integrated 1G2G process and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> summarizes the main assumptions for the evaluated scenarios. Detailed information about biomass composition and production system (productivities, mechanization level, others) as well as industrial process (e.g., operational conditions and yields) according to the technology levels and timeframes are presented in the Additional file
