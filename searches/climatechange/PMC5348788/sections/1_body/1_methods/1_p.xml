<p class="p">The Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB), developed at the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE), was employed to perform the techno-economic and environmental assessment of sugarcane biorefineries. The VSB is a computational framework that allows simulation and evaluation of the entire sugarcane chain and other biomasses (from biomass production to final products use) considering the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social [
