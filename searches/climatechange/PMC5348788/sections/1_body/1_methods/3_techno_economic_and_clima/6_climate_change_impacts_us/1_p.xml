<p class="p">The assessment of climate change impacts was performed through life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. It is a broadly recognized methodology for estimating the environmental burden associated with a product, process, or activity, by the identification and quantification of energy and materials used and waste released, during its entire life cycle [

SimaPro software and the Ecoinvent database v2.2 were employed to obtain the datasets of the main inputs used in the product system evaluated (e.g., production of diesel, fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals used as input in the process) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. This impact category was selected because the potential to reduce GHG emissions has been one of the main motivations that drive research and use of renewable energy alternatives. For instance, targets of reductions in GHG emissions for biofuels replacing their fossil counterparts have been defined in the RSF2 regulatory framework [
