<p class="p">Investments were based on VSB’s databank and methodology. In this approach, flows calculated through process simulation are used to estimate equipment capacities. In order to represent new engineering solutions and maturity evolution of 2G and biodigestion processes, reductions in medium- and long-term estimates equal to 10 and 20%, respectively, were considered for investments in these equipment. Economic assessment considered greenfield projects, i.e., new facilities. Main economic assumptions are presented in Table
