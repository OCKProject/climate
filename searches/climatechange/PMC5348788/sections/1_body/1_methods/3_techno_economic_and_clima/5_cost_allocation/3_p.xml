<p class="p">Considering that a biorefinery produces more than one product, an allocation criterion for operating and capital costs was applied. Ethanol production cost was calculated considering the allocation of overall yearly costs (operating and capital costs) between ethanol and electricity based on their participation on revenues. In the integrated 1G2G scenarios, an additional allocation step between 1G and 2G ethanol was performed, based on their participation in the ethanol output, to identify the impacts exclusively related to 2G ethanol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In this case, for a same time horizon, it was considered that 1G ethanol has the same cost in both 1G and 1G2G scenarios. Therefore, all the additional costs are allocated to 2G ethanol.
