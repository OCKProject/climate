<p class="p">Sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of possible variations on biomass, enzymes, and capital costs in both 1G and 2G ethanol production costs. In addition, variation in electricity price, which affects the allocation of production costs, was applied to show its influence on the results. FigureÂ
