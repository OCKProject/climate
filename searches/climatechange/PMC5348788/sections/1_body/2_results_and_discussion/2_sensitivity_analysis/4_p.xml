<p class="p">It is worth highlighting that the exchange rate is also an important variable, which impacts 2G ethanol production costs in the Brazilian currency. Considering that a significant share of imported 2G equipment (pretreatment reactor, for instance) is estimated in US dollars and that enzymes are reliant on prices set by foreign companies, a high exchange rate volatility may increase uncertainties to the 2G production costs in the Brazilian market, especially in the short term. However, as much as the 2G ethanol internal market becomes more competitive and mature over time, it is expected that this effect may decrease due to a possible expansion of local 2G equipment and enzyme manufacturers.</p>
