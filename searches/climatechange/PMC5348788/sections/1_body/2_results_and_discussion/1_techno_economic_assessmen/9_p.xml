 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> depicted, 2G cost is lower than 1G from medium to long terms due to the relatively faster decrease of 2G costs. These results rely on a variety of assumptions. First, the 2G technology is still in the beginning of its technological learning curve whereas 1G is a mature technology which has a lower potential for cost decrease in the industrial stage. Biomass cost reductions are still possible (due to new sugarcane varieties and the introduction of energy cane); therefore, 1G ethanol can experience further cost reduction mostly related to advances in the agricultural production systems. Second, the high costs associated with 2G technology rely on the current choices of industrial routes and equipment design (such as those dedicated to pretreatment area) that may evolve over the years. Considering the potential of reduction in capital, and enzyme and biomass costs with the increase of industrial yields, 2G technology has higher potential of cost reduction over time.
