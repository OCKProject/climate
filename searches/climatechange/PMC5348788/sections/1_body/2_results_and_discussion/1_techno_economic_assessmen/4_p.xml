In the short term, 237 L of ethanol is produced per metric ton of dry biomass processed in 2G unit. This figure is consistent with the information released by Raízen, one of Brazil’s pioneers in 2G ethanol production. Raízen claims to obtain 211 L per metric ton of dry biomass and expects to achieve 289 L at full capacity operation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], so results for the long-term scenarios (~350 L/t) seem reasonable for 2030. The experience with 1G ethanol in Brazil has shown that economies of scale and technological advances may lead to a remarkable increase in its competitiveness as fuel [
