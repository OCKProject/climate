<p class="p">The investment for each scenario is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. For comparison purposes, the investments were divided into two sectors: 1G+ interface and 2G. The first sector aggregates the processing areas usually found in the conventional first-generation ethanol plants (such as sugarcane reception, juice extraction, juice treatment, fermentation, distillation, CHP unit), biodigestion unit, administrative infrastructure, engineering, among others. The 2G sector includes areas specifically related to 2G processes, such as pretreatment, C5 fermentation, and enzymatic hydrolysis. The highest investment estimates are observed for the long-term scenarios (1G-LT and 1G2G-LT), due to the higher installed capacities and larger cost-intensive areas, such as the CHP (considering an optimized configuration) in 1G-LT and 2G plants (in particular, pretreatment and C5 liquor separation) in 1G2G-LT. At the same time, the lowest investment is related to 1G-base scenario, which has the lowest plant capacity and base technological level. The 1G+ interface investment in 1G2G scenarios is lower than those of 1G scenarios, even with the increase in fermentation and ethanol production areas that are shared between both processes, because the CHP unit capacity is smaller in 1G2G scenarios due to the use of biomass for 2G ethanol production.
