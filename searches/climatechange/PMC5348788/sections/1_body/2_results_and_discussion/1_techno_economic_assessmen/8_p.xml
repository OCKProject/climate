<p class="p">Ethanol production costs for 1G scenarios in the short term (1G-Base and 1G-ST) presented similar values. Although the modern configuration (1G-ST) has an extra revenue from electricity (which reduces the fraction of the total costs allocated to ethanol), higher capital costs (mainly related to CHP unit) and additional costs with straw recovery result in increased ethanol production cost. 2G ethanol presents higher costs than 1G in the short term mainly due to high capital cost associated with the additional investment and enzyme costs that together represent roughly 65% of the total 2G cost. Although both costs are expected to reduce over time, the trend shows that 2G ethanol cost will be lower in the medium and long terms if the expected technological advances are obtained. For instance, the capital cost, which is the main component of production cost, is significantly reduced due to lower residence times and higher solid contents in the 2G process. Additionally, reductions in investment estimates in the medium and long terms are anticipated because of the development of local equipment manufacturers, which are assumed to deliver more cost-competitive solutions overtime. Biomass costs also decrease over time as a consequence of projected developments in the agricultural production system, including the introduction of energy cane. Another driver for reduction in 2G ethanol production costs is the cost of enzyme, which is expected to have lower contribution with the development of more efficient enzymatic cocktails and establishment of local enzyme producers.</p>
