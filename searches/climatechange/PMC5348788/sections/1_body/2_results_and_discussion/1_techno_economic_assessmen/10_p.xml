<p class="p">The comparison of ethanol production costs and the oil price in the international scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) indicates that both 1G and 2G ethanol are competitive in the short term if oil prices exceed US$ 100/bbl and US$ 130/bbl, respectively. In the long term, ethanol competitiveness is achieved for oil prices above US$ 65/bbl and US$ 45/bbl for 1G and 2G ethanol, respectively. For comparison, although oil price has recently dropped to lower levels, it ranged from US$ 60/bbl to US$ 115/bbl between 2010 and 2014 [
