<p class="p">Operational costs were estimated for each scenario based on the expenses with raw materials, labor, maintenance, enzymes, among others. These costs, added to the capital costs (relative to the investment), are allocated between the biorefinery products to obtain the ethanol production cost, as described in the “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref>” section. Projected ethanol production costs over time are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, along with the oil price required to produce gasoline with equivalent cost in energy basis. These estimations consider the share of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil on the US gasoline price breakdown according to the data from the US Energy Information Administration [
