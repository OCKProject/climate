<p class="p">Environmental impacts for electricity, 1G ethanol, and 2G ethanol were allocated using the same criteria employed in the economic assessment; thus, impacts are proportional to the participation of each product on revenues. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> presents climate change impacts of ethanol for the evaluated scenarios, considering a cradle-to-gate analysis. At this point, for comparison purposes, impacts related to biofuel distribution and use were not included since there is no expected difference in these life cycle steps for the considered scenarios.
