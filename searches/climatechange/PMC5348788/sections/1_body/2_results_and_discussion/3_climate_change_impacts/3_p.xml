<p class="p">To compare ethanol GHG emissions with those from gasoline, the entire life cycle needs to be considered (cradle-to-grave analysis). In this sense, the emissions from ethanol distribution and use (1.03 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> eq/MJ, for all the evaluated scenarios) were added to ethanol cradle-to-gate results from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. The LCA was applied to both ethanol and gasoline under same conditions, methods, and databases, making this comparison reasonable. Considering that the production and use of gasoline in Brazil emits 87.4 g CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> eq/MJ, 1G ethanol in medium and long terms and 2G ethanol present climate change impact reduction by over 80% in comparison to gasoline. This result is in line with other important studies for Brazilian sugarcane ethanol (not including land use change emissions or ethanol transportation to other countries) [
