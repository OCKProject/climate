<p class="p">There is a clear potential for 2G ethanol to achieve a lower production cost compared to 1G ethanol in the medium to long term, even considering several technological and market uncertainties. However, 2G process is at the beginning of its learning curve and expected improvements will depend on the diffusion and adoption of these new technologies. Therefore, additional mechanisms to encourage R&amp;D, as well as production and consumption of 2G ethanol in Brazil, can be proposed to accelerate the path along the learning curve.</p>
