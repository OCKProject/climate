 <xref rid="RSOS160647C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] have called for studies involving predictive modelling of the effects of climate change on species, populations and communities. Although climatologists have made considerable progress in developing global models to predict environmental disasters [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], ecologists have been slower to adopt a similar approach (but see [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]), though some models have been developed to predict species distribution changes [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], extinction risks [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and alterations to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Predictive models in ecology rarely feature the possibility of Darwinian evolution, originally because evolution was assumed to be irrelevant in short- to medium-term predictive models [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], but more recently because it is considered difficult to incorporate the complexity of evolution into models of ecological processes, particularly because of the need for large amounts of relevant data with which to parametrize models of evolutionary change. It is now recognized, however, that significant evolutionary and ecological changes can occur over similar time scales [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], suggesting that evolution could respond rapidly to climate change [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], and two-way interactions between evolution and ecological processes are probably common [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Predictions of alterations in species distributions, flowering times and species traits may therefore be inaccurate unless evolution in traits that can undergo strong selection in response to climate change is taken into consideration.
