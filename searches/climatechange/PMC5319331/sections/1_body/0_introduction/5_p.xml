<p class="p">Among the least understood life-history stages in herbaceous plants is vegetative dormancy. Instead of sprouting every year, individual plants of species that exhibit this phenomenon may remain underground in a rhizomatous or tuberous state, potentially for several consecutive years, before re-emerging [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. However, more recent data suggest that vegetative dormancy can be either an adaptive response to environmental stress or life-history costs associated with sprouting, as in

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], or a bet-hedging trait in response to unpredictable risks in the above-ground environment, as in

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Consequently, the deterministic, directional nature of climate change may present a gradual increase in stress for dormancy-prone species, resulting in selection for increased vegetative dormancy over time.
