<p class="p">Ultimately, the fates of individual organisms scale up to influence many of the processes of interest when predicting species' responses to climate change. Life-history traits are likely to exert significant influences on population dynamics, because of the strong, direct relationships between fitness and demography [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and these influences may depend on changes in mean climatic variables, and on variation about mean values [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Predicting life-history evolution therefore requires the integration of validated evolutionary models of the expected changes in traits of interest with accurate, predictive climatic models. The output of such models will aid the development of management strategies for populations of conservation concern.
