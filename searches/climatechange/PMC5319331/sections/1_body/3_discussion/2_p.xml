<p class="p">Our models predict that the probability of sprouting will evolve in different directions over time in the three study species. Even at the same site, the congeneric 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> were predicted to evolve differently, with natural selection favouring increasing sprouting probability throughout the next 80 years in the former species, and fluctuating sprouting probability around the current value in the latter (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). In contrast with both of these predictions, 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> is forecast to evolve greater dormancy over the same period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>). These differences are especially striking given the similarities in predicted climatic trends at the two sites occupied by these species.
