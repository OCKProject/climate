<p class="p">Adaptive evolution in demographic parameters such as sprouting probability might at least partially counteract any increase in the risk of extinction associated with climate change. Evolutionary rescue occurs when a threatened population avoids extinction through adaptation [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], adaptive evolution may counter the forces moving populations towards extinction by favouring genotypes that increase population growth [
