<p class="p">Although our models predict contrasting trends in the evolution of sprouting, we also note a similar life-history context to this trait in all three species. In particular, although sprouting exhibits a range of relationships with size and flowering status, growth exerts costs upon survival in all three species, at least in juvenile and vegetative plants (
