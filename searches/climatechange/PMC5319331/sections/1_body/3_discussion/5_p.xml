<p class="p">The predictions of our models reflect a changing adaptive landscape of sprouting probability in relation to other demographic parameters and in response to predicted changes in climate. Sprouting strongly influences fitness for several reasons. First, it is essential for sexual reproduction, as flowers cannot form and pollination cannot occur without above-ground growth. Second, sprouting can have a strong impact upon survival, particularly if it increases mortality by consuming resources that could have sustained the plant against adverse conditions or greater herbivory as a consequence of climate change [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Finally, sprouting may exert a cost on reproduction. As fitness is a function of sprouting and dormancy [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], and as demographic parameters often vary considerably in response to climate [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], climate change is likely to alter the context of relationships between sprouting and fitness. For example, in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, higher temperature and precipitation drive higher sprouting probabilities and larger size, and are associated with lower mortality, resulting in selection for increased probability of sprouting. However, growth to larger sizes also results in higher mortality, lower future sprouting probability, and a higher probability of shrinkage, the latter two of which are more pronounced with higher precipitation (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Growth also leads to a higher probability of flowering in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>. This is associated with decreased survival in the following year, but increased survival in the year after that. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, the life-history context surrounding vegetative dormancy is simpler, because plants have higher survival when they are dormant or small, or large and flowering. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> evolves a lower probability of sprouting under warmer, wetter conditions, because of strong positive relationships between precipitation and growth, and mortality and size, and by a strong negative impact of reproduction on survival.
