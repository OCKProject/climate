<p class="p">Predicting the evolutionary responses of species will become increasingly important as the impacts of climate change intensify. Evolution can be rapid [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. We have used a relatively simple approach to predict evolutionary trends in just one trait. Only continued monitoring until 2099 will demonstrate whether our predictions reflect realistic evolutionary trajectories. Although analysis of the impacts of evolution using more traits, and of its impact on communities and on ecosystems, poses a greater challenge, the difficulties are certainly surmountable. The insights gained from this approach may strengthen approaches to management by taking into account more realistic predictions of the consequences of rapid climate change.
