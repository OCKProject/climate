<p class="p">Our predictions are dependent upon these populations being able to evolve quickly. The speed of evolution in response to climate change may be limited by existing genetic variation, population size, gene flow and the strength of selection [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. It may also be influenced by the extent to which environmental factors and traits impose constraints and lags on the trait of interest. Although we do not have data on variation for sprouting potential within the study populations, many demographic parameters are known to have high genetic variance [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], and different parameters often exhibit strong genotype × environment interactions [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], which can preserve genetic variation if the relative fitness of genotypes changes over time. Although orchid populations are often small, increasing the possibility of genetic drift, natural selection can still act strongly and proceed more quickly in smaller populations in some contexts [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. In addition, our predictions assume that relationships between vital rates, and between vital rates and climate variables, will not change over time, and particularly that they will not evolve in ways that indirectly impact sprouting.
