<p class="p">The primary challenge in predicting the impacts of climate change on population or species viability may not be to quantify evolutionary changes in traits of interest to the evolutionary biologist, but to identify the traits that are most likely to evolve in response to climate change. Addressing this challenge is important, because the evolution of any trait depends on many factors, including its genetic basis, its relationships with other traits, population size and spatial distribution [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. In this regard, the development of a modelling framework to predict the simultaneous evolution of multiple traits, particularly under genetic and regulatory linkage, is an important challenge. Genetic correlations are a major test for evolutionary prediction, because they can lead to evolution in traits that are not expected to evolve, they can speed up or slow down evolution in traits of interest, and they can even drive the evolution of seemingly suboptimal or maladaptive traits [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Such correlations may also behave as trade-offs that are potentially capable of evolution in response to climate change, and may in some cases act across years via lagged effects. Although we did not allow evolution of trade-offs in our models, all trade-offs might all be capable of evolution, potentially in unexpected directions [
