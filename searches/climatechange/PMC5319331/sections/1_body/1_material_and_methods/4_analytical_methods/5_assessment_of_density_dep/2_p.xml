<p class="p">Adaptive dynamics models assume that there is competition between genotypes. This requirement is generally met in life-history simulations by assuming the operation of negative density dependence in a key vital rate. Usually, only one key vital rate is chosen in order to create the most parsimonious model [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. We used GLMMs to test all demographic rates and probabilities included in the matrices for conspecific density dependence (fixed factor) in all years (random factor), for the purpose of identifying a suitable negatively density-dependent parameter. Although transitions from germination and recruitment to the seedling stage are strongly density-dependent in many herbaceous perennials [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], we could not test for this in our species. Instead, we sought evidence of density dependence in the adult stages. The density of adult plants was estimated by placing a grid of 1 × 1 m over maps of each population and counting the number of individuals in each square. In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, sprouting individuals always consisted of a single sprout, whereas the number of sprouts differed between 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> individuals. In 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, we used the number of individuals rather than number of sprouts per unit area to assess density.
