<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> life cycle also included a minimum of 4 years in each of which an individual could occupy one of 10 juvenile stages (three protocorm stages, a new seedling stage and non-flowering, 1- and 2-year-old seedlings with 0, 1 or 2 sprouts), plus a dormant seed stage (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). These juvenile stages were not monitored for this study, because these species are of conservation concern and monitoring these subterranean stages would cause considerable damage to the population and its habitat. Instead, these elements of the matrices were parametrized using data from other studies [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. We tested the sensitivity of our results to different assumed numbers of seeds per fruit, percentage germination and probability of transition to seedlings, by increasing or decreasing each by 10% and repeating our adaptive dynamics analyses. These alterations did not appreciably change estimates, and therefore we do not present those results further. Altogether, these historical matrices had dimensionality of 395 × 395.
