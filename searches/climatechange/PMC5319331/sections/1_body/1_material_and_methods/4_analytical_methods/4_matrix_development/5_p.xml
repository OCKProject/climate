<p class="p">We developed deterministic and stochastic versions of both models, with both incorporating climatic variables. The stochastic models included random draws of values from the distributions of climatic variables, while the deterministic models incorporated only the mean climatic values. The stochastic models also incorporated a random year term in each estimated vital rate. This was drawn from the random year effect using the best-fit GLMMs for each term.</p>
