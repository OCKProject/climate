<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> matrix model was an age × stage model with 10+ years of adult life (we modelled stasis in the adult stage corresponding to year 10 to allow for long lifespan), and 17 mature states per year of adult life (one to eight leaves, either flowering or vegetative, plus vegetative dormancy), in addition to a minimum of 2 years in three unmonitored juvenile stages (two protocorm stages and one seedling stage; electronic supplementary material, figure S1
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>), yielding a matrix with dimensionality of 173 × 173. Modelling involved the development of transition probabilities from vital rate functions based on the best-fit GLMM models of vital rates (electronic supplementary material, table S3), as in 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>.
