<p class="p">We constructed all possible reduced models from the global models. The model with the lowest AICc was typically used as the best-fit model for inference, except in cases where an equally parsimonious model (i.e. ΔAICc ≤ 2.0) had fewer parameters. Exhaustive model assessment was conducted in R using the
