<p class="p">In previous analyses [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], we determined that estimates of costs of growth and reproduction were required across 3 years to accurately model the life history of 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>. To incorporate longer-term individual history, we also included size and flowering status of individuals in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> − 1 in 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> models. In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, we had no previous analyses to suggest the importance of long-term life history. Furthermore, the short lifespan of this species relative to the length of the observation period led us to test the impact of age rather than individual history. So, in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, we used time since first observation as a proxy for age from germination, instead of status (i.e. size and flowering status) in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> − 1 [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Because our two time-step approach to 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> yielded adaptive dynamics models consistent with observed sprouting patterns, we did not attempt to include individual history in any further mixed modelling exercises in this species. Finally, in 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, in models of fruiting probability and number of fruits, we replaced size in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> with the number of flowers produced by each sprout in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>, because more than 95% of flowering sprouts only had one flower. These models served as global, or most parametrized, models, and included all two-way interactions between fixed factors, with year as the sole random factor.
