<p class="p">We used general linear mixed models (GLMMs) to explore the influences of selected ecological characteristics and climatic variables on all major vital rates and transition probabilities between different life states, including all size classes of flowering and non-flowering individuals, and vegetative dormancy, using the 
 <italic class="italic">lme4</italic> package in R v. 3.2.2 [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The vital rates and probabilities estimated in our analysis were: survival probability from year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> to year 
 <italic class="italic">t </italic>+ 1 (binomial), sprouting probability in year 
 <italic class="italic">t </italic>+ 1 conditional upon survival between years 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">t </italic>+ 1 (binomial), probability of growth for every size class in year 
 <italic class="italic">t </italic>+ 1 conditional upon both survival and sprouting (Poisson, with variance not significantly different from the mean in all three species), flowering probability in year 
 <italic class="italic">t </italic>+ 1 conditional upon survival and sprouting in the same year (binomial), and number of flowers per individual in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> conditional upon sprouting and flowering in the same year (Poisson). In 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, fruiting probability of flowering individuals in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> conditional upon flowering (binomial), and number of fruits per individual in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> conditional upon flowering and fruiting in the same year (Poisson) were also estimated.
