<p class="p">Each vital rate served as an independent response term in a GLMM global model that incorporated status across the two previous years, and climate in the current year. The following independent factors were used in all global models: size in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> (for 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, the measure of size was total number of sprouts; for 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> it was number of leaves per sprout), flowering status in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> (binomial: sprouts either flowered or they did not), and two weather variables, one representing temperature and the other representing precipitation at the sites occupied by each of the species. For 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, these variables were the total number of days with minimum temperatures below freezing in the winter before recording (termed ‘winter frost days’), and total annual precipitation in the preceding calendar year. For 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, the variables were number of hours of sunlight in April and May, and total precipitation from the start of February to the end of May, in the year of recording. The choice of these climatic variables was based on previous analyses of the responses of these species to weather variables [
