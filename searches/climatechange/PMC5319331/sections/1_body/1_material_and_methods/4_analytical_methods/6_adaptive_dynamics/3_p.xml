<p class="p">Simulations of each species' adaptive dynamics began with a single plant with a deviation in its probability of sprouting from the estimated 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept value. These deviations produced a range of sprouting probabilities from very infrequent (as low as approx. 20% in some conditions) to near-certain probabilities of sprouting. The plant was assumed to multiply clonally until the population reached a plateau density. This density was obtained by optimizing 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> in a Ricker function that served to modify a selected density-dependent vital rate in each population. (Although our study species are primarily sexual rather than clonal, other analyses have demonstrated the robustness of this approach in retrospective analyses [
