<p class="p">The matrices described above were used in adaptive dynamics simulations to determine the optimal sprouting probability in each species. We treated the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept in the GLMM for sprouting as the evolving trait in our analysis, both because the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept has been used as the target parameter of evolution in previous studies [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and because there is currently insufficient understanding of sprouting to allow the use of a more fine-scale, mechanistic sprouting trait. This intercept is a constant in the binomial equation determining sprouting probability, and can be positive or negative. It represents the intrinsic tendency to sprout, with higher/lower values indicating increasing/decreasing sprouting probability, regardless of plant state or weather. We developed resident and invader matrices using set values of climate-related variables, and used deviations from the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept in the GLMM as inputs in these matrices. Our method is based on a similar approach for determining optimal flowering frequency in monocarpic perennials [
