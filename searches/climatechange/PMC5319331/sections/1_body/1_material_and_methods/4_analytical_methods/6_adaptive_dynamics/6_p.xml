<p class="p">We developed both deterministic and stochastic versions of these models, with mean values of climate variables recorded over the monitoring periods as input. The stochastic models differed from the deterministic models by including random draws with replacement of years, each of which was associated with its own random year intercept from the associated GLMM, and values for climatic variables, which were selected randomly from the distributions of climatic variables at each site. We used the deterministic models in evolutionary prediction both because the deterministic models yielded sprouting 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercepts that did not differ significantly from those estimated in the original GLMMs, and because the stochastic models were less parsimonious, and involved greater uncertainty.
