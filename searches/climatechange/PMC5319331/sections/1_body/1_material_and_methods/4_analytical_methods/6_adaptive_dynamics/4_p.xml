<p class="p">For simplicity, we assumed that there was only one negatively density-dependent demographic parameter in each population. This parameter was chosen by testing whether its density dependence function yielded a realistic plateau density. Because we sought to develop a parsimonious model, we did not incorporate all density-dependent rates, but focused on finding a single rate that appeared most likely to respond to competition between conspecifics. In each case, a process of iteration and testing against all negatively density-dependent vital rates was used to select a rate that yielded asymptotic population growth (most did not). Following analyses showing that no other demographic parameter yielded realistic density plateaus, sprouting probability was the selected parameter for both
