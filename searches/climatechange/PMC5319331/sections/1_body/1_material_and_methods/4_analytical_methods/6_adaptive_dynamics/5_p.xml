<p class="p">Initial model optimization assumed a sprouting 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept deviation of 0. Once a plateau population density was reached, a single invading mutant with either the same or a different sprouting 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept was introduced into the population, and allowed to multiply clonally. The average growth rate of the mutant proportion of the population over 100 annual time steps was used as a measure of the relative fitness of the mutant. This process was repeated for pairs of resident and mutant individuals, each with a wide range of sprouting probabilities, to create a fitness landscape showing the conditions under which mutant sprouting strategies would spread, go extinct or remain at equilibrium with resident strategies (termed pairwise invasibility analysis [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]). Evolutionarily stable strategies in such analyses are areas of the fitness landscape to which the trait evolves over time, and may be local or general, and stable or unstable.
