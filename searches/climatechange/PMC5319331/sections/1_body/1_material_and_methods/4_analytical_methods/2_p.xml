<p class="p">For each of our study species, we modelled evolutionary changes in sprouting probability in response to predicted local climate change. This involved the following steps, which are described in detail below: (i) analysis of the key vital rates in each population, including survival, sprouting, flowering and, in 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic>, fruiting, to model them as linear functions of density, weather and age or previous life history, (ii) using these functions to develop high-dimensionality population projection matrices, (iii) examination of demographic behaviour for evidence of density dependence, (iv) development and testing of climate-sensitive adaptive dynamics models to predict optimal sprouting probability, and (v) using these adaptive dynamics models to predict evolutionary trends in sprouting probability in response to predictions of future climate at the sites occupied by the species.
