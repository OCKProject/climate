 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> site, as functions of weather variables (generally daily or monthly temperature, and precipitation totals) common to both the actual and modelled climate datasets. Sunlight hours were estimated from projected surface-level shortwave radiation using the Suehrcke method, with constants for southern England supplied from the literature [
