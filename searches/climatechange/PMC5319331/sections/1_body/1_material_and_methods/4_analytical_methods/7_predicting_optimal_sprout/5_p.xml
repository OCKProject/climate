<p class="p">Because simulated climate data did not match observed climate data perfectly over the calibration period (1979â€“2003), we corrected simulated data by the difference in mean climate values between observed and simulated data during the years in which they overlapped. To assess the effect of this correction against the projected validation data, we also re-ran the analysis without this correction. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>. The uncorrected 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> model failed to converge.
