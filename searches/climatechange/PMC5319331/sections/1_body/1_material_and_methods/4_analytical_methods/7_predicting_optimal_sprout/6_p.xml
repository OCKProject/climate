<p class="p">Finally, we assessed the impacts of predicted evolutionary trends on population growth rate in all three species. First, we estimated population growth rate for each year from 1979 to 2099 using matrix models parametrized with the climate projected from model MRI-AGCM3.2H for that year, under scenarios under which sprouting either did or did not evolve. Here, population growth rate was estimated as deterministic 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>, or the dominant eigenvalue for the annual matrix, and optimal 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept values were estimated with each 25-year running mean of weather variables. Next, we looked at the effect of evolution in sprouting on the population growth rate via life table response analysis. To do this, we compared projection matrices in which sprouting evolved, against matrices in which it did not, over the period 2075–2099. We performed this analysis using the
