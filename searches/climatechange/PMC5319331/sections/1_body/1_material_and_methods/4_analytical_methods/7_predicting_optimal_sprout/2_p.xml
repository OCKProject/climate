<p class="p">After determining the optimal sprouting 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept for the climatic conditions recorded during the years of monitoring, we repeated the adaptive dynamics simulations, as described above, using predicted values for climate variables for the years 2075–2099 at each of the study locations. The model used, MRI-AGCM3.2S, predicts future climate at a spatial resolution of 20 × 20 km, and at a temporal resolution of 1 day [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. It has been validated using real climate data for 1979–2003 in the greater Pacific region [

 <xref rid="RSOS160647C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], and used to predict changes in population growth rates in some desert plant species caused by changes in survival and other demographic parameters associated with climate change [

Because the simulated data in this model only cover the periods 1979–2003 and 2075–2099, we also used simulated climate values from MRI-AGCM3.2H, a companion model that predicts climate at a spatial resolution of 60 × 60 km for every day from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 2099 [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We also obtained data from both models for surface-level shortwave radiation received per month (W m

 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> site. This was used to estimate the number of hours of sunlight expected per day throughout the simulation period.
