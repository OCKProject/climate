<p class="p">Initially, we developed a full adaptive dynamics model for each population using the 2075–2099 predicted climate data from the MRI-AGCM3.2S model. We also assessed evolutionary optima from 1979 to 2099 using the predicted climate from MRI-AGCM3.2H. Rather than using each year's climate as the optimization input, we used the mean of climate values for each year and the preceding 25 years. This allowed the optimization procedure to more realistically reflect our use of the mean climate over 21–32 years of actual observation to determine the optimum sprouting tendency, and to buffer predictions from exhibiting large fluctuations from year to year. Each year, from the end of monitoring until 2099, thus had its own associated optimum value for the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept of sprouting, reflecting climatic conditions over the previous 25 years. Rather than representing values that will actually occur in the future, these sprouting tendencies should be interpreted as optima towards which natural selection will direct our target trait. Standard errors for these optimal 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercepts were estimated using 1000 hierarchical, non-parametric bootstraps of randomly selected individuals from the original demographic datasets.
