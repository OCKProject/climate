 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> populations were monitored every year at the start of flowering, in mid-May to early-June. We mapped the positions of all emergent plants, and then searched for others that had been observed in previous years. We define a sprout in 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> as a single stem originating from a bud at the end of a rhizome. An individual plant can have several sprouts if the rhizome has branched, or if two buds form at rhizome tips. The number of sprouts produced by every plant, and the number of flowers on each sprout, was recorded. We could not search for seedlings, because they are both difficult to find in the tallgrass vegetation, and because the timing of their sprouting is unpredictable. In July of every year from 2000 onwards, we also recorded the number of fruits produced by each sprout.
