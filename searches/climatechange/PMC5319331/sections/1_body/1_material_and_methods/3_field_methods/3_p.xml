 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> was recorded in a permanently marked 20 × 20 m quadrat. The position of every emergent plant was recorded in each year of the study by triangulation from two of the quadrat corners. Individual plants produce a single rosette of leaves, which is termed a sprout in this study. We recorded whether each plant was vegetative or flowering, the numbers of leaves and, for flowering plants, the number of flowers produced.
