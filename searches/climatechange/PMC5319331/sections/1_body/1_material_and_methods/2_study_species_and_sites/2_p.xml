<p class="p">We studied one population each of 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> Salisb., 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> Muhl. ex. Willd., and 
 <italic class="italic">O. sphegodes</italic> Mill (hereafter, 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, respectively). These species begin life as dust seeds, and germinate in association with an appropriate mycorrhizal fungus [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Germination leads to a life stage termed a protocorm, in which the plant is non-photosynthetic, mycotrophic and subterranean [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> species, the protocorm stage may last for 3 or more years [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, the protocorm is thought to last for up to 2 years before developing into a seedling [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Seedlings of all species may sprout or remain completely subterranean in any year. 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> spp. are capable of living as a juvenile for up to 10 years before developing into adult plants, although the exact number of years varies between individuals (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). Vegetative dormancy of up to 15 years has been documented in adult plants [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, most episodes of dormancy are less than or equal to 2 years, although dormancy of up to 8 years has been recorded (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) [
 <xref rid="RSOS160647C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>].
