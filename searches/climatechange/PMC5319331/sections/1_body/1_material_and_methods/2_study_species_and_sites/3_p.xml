 <italic class="italic">parviflorum</italic> were monitored every year from 1994 to 2014 in a wet alkaline meadow at Gavin Prairie Nature Preserve, northeastern Illinois, USA. One

 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> spp. in drier areas, and by 
 <italic class="italic">Carex</italic> spp. with some 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> spp. in wetter, tussock-filled areas. The vegetation at Castle Hill is ancient sheep-grazed, species-rich, calcareous grassland. Further site details are provided by Shefferson
