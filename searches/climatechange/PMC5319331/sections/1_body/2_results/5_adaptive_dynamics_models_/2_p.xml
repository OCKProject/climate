<p class="p">Adaptive dynamics models predicted that observed 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercepts for sprouting probability were evolutionarily stable strategies. The optimal deviation on the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept in the mixed model predicting sprouting probability was 0.153 ± 0.168 (mean ± 1 s.e.), −0.131 ± 0.449 and 0.844 ± 0.451, for 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum, C. candidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, respectively (electronic supplementary material, figure S3
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>–
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). These are additive deviations from the original 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercepts estimated in our best-fit GLMMs (
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>: −2.065 ± 2.007, 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>: 0.410 ± 2.052, 
 <italic class="italic">O. sphegodes</italic>: 0.237 ± 0.200; electronic supplementary material, tables S1–S3). In all cases, the confidence interval for the optimal deviation included 0, and therefore the models successfully predicted the sprouting probabilities observed over the monitoring periods. When the uncorrected portion of the simulated climate data that overlapped with field data was used as input, the optimal sprouting 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-intercept deviations were 0.500, 0.431 and 0.630 for 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, respectively.
