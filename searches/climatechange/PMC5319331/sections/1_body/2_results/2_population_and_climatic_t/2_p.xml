<p class="p">Above-ground population size in both 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> populations was roughly stable at the beginning of the study, but declined towards 2010. The number of emergent plants in the 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> population was low until 1991, after which it increased nearly sixfold, and then began a slow decline to the end of the study, in 2006. Estimated numbers of living juveniles + adults (not including seedlings) ranged between years from 330 to 575 in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, from 46 to 71 in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, and from 41 to 657 in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>. Estimates of annual deterministic 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> ranged from 0.971 to 1.138 (mean ± 1 s.e. = 1.056 ± 0.011) in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, from 0.919 to 1.144 (mean ± 1 s.e. = 1.062 ± 0.013) in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, and from 0.869 to 1.123 (mean ±1 s.e. = 0.992 ± 0.015) in
