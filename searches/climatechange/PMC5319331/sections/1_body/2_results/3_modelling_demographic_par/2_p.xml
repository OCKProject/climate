<p class="p">Vital rates and probabilities were strongly driven by size and flowering status. Best-fit models and equally parsimonious models with fewer parameters for most vital rates in all species typically included size and flowering status in year 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> as a predictor variable (electronic supplementary material, tables S4â€“S6). Individual history had a significant effect on all vital rates apart from juvenile sprouting in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S4), and flowering probability, fruiting probability, number of fruits and juvenile sprouting in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, tables S2 and S5). In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, age since first observation affected survival, but did not affect other vital rates (electronic supplementary material, tables S3 and S6).
