<p class="p">Sprouting was associated with costs to survival in all three species. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, probability of survival was highest for plants that remained small or dormant between years, and for plants that fluctuated between large and small/dormant (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). Juvenile 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> plants exhibited lower survival with larger size (electronic supplementary material, table S1). In 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, survival was highest in consistently large plants, but was also high in plants that fluctuated between vegetative dormancy and small size, and in plants that stayed small or dormant (

 <italic class="italic">b</italic>). In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, the highest survival occurred when plants remained dormant. Moreover, survival was lower for larger non-flowering, emergent plants, but in flowering plants there was a positive relationship between size and survival to the subsequent year (
