<p class="p">Climate strongly influenced many vital rates. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, adult survival and sprouting were functions of number of winter frost days and annual precipitation (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>). In 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, adult sprouting was a function of both of these climatic variables, whereas survival was only a function of winter frost days (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>; electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2). In 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, adult survival was negatively correlated with both number of hours of sunshine and spring precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>), although this typically negative relationship was driven by interactions between size, flowering and climate (electronic supplementary material, table S3). Adult sprouting was not correlated with climatic variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S3). Juvenile survival and sprouting were not functions of climate in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S3
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> and table S1). However, in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, juvenile survival decreased with increasing annual precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S2), and, due to a strong interaction with size, juvenile sprouting increased with increasing number of winter frost days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S2). Reproduction was less sensitive to climate in all species. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, climatic variables did not affect the probabilities of flowering or fruiting or the number of flowers or fruits produced. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, the number of flowers produced by flowering sprouts decreased with precipitation, while other vital rates were not affected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S2). Finally, in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, the probability of flowering decreased with hours of sunshine and increased with precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS160647F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>,
