<p class="p">Survival was positively density dependent in both 
 <italic class="italic">Cypripedium</italic> species, but negatively density dependent in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S2
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). Sprouting probability was negatively density dependent in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> juveniles and adults, and in

 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> and in

 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> plants recorded for the first time, in which it was negatively density dependent (electronic supplementary material, figure S2
