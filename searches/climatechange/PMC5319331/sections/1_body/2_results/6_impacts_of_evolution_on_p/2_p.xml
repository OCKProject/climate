<p class="p">Deterministic population growth rates (
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>) estimated until 2099 using models with and without evolution in sprouting, suggested decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic>, increasing 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, and fluctuating 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). In all cases, evolution in sprouting caused marginal increases in mean values of 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Projected differences in 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> due to evolution were driven primarily by altered transitional values in plants remaining in the vegetative or dormant state in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S5) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S6), and by stasis in dormant or small individuals in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). Particularly, altered stasis in dormancy among typically dormant individuals, and altered probabilities of transition to flowering after two vegetative years, had positive effects on 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>, while altered growth to flowering among typically dormant individuals, and altered shrinkage after two vegetative years had a negative effect on 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">C. parviflorum</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). Patterns were similar in 
 <italic class="italic">C. candidum</italic>, except that altered shrinkage transitions among consistently vegetative individuals tended to increase 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Finally, in 
 <italic class="italic">Ophrys</italic>, growth from dormancy had a positive effect on 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>, particularly when it involved transitions to flowering stages (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). By contrast, stasis in dormancy reduced 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> the most, followed by shrinkage to small vegetative stages (electronic supplementary material, figure S7).
