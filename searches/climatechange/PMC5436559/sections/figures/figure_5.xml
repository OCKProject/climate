  <p class="p">Population projections for Yellow-eyed penguins at Boulder Beach, Otago Peninsula. The graphs show the observed (red line) and estimated (black line) number of female penguins, and associated 95% credible interval (grey area), as derived from the population model. The dashed vertical line indicates the last year used to parameterise the MR model and the starting year of the simulation. Population projections were modelled using survival rate estimates until 2012; beyond this year estimates get increasingly unreliable because these are based on data about individual absence from breeding rather than from reported mortalities (see ‘Methods’).</p>
