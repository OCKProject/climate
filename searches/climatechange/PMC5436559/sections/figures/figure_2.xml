  <title class="title">Observed penguin numbers at Kumo Kumo Whero and Boulder Beach.</title>
  <p class="p">Observed penguin numbers at Kumo Kumo Whero 1937–1948 (from data published in Richdale 1957, see ‘Methods’ for details) and at the Boulder Beach complex 1982–2015 as extracted from the Yellow-eyed penguin database. ‘New breeders’ represents the portion of all ‘breeding adults’ that were recorded as breeders for the first time. Red arrows indicate years with observed die-off events affecting adult breeders. Note that as some sections of the Boulder Beach complex were not monitored in all years, data for the years 1986–1989 were adjusted by adding the mean proportion these areas contributed to the total count in all other years.</p>
