 <p class="p">We would like to extend our gratitude to the many field workers and students involved in penguin monitoring that contributed data to the YEPDB. Special thanks are due to Bruce McKinlay, Jim Fyfe, and Jim Watts from the Department of Conservation Coastal Otago office for their efforts to maintain a regular monitoring schedule in the face of limited resources within the department.</p>
