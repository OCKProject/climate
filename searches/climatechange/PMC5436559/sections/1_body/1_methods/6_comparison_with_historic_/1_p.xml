 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richdale (1957)</xref> provides comprehensive data on penguin demography allowing it to draw comparisons between historic and contemporary penguin numbers. We inferred population parameters from three tables. Table 67 (p147) provides direct information about the number of eggs laid and chicks fledged. Using number of eggs, we inferred the number of nests for the reported years by assuming only two-egg clutches were present. In Table 72 (p154), Richdale reports the percentage of surviving breeders of both sexes for each year, adjusted to the fractional format by dividing the reported values by 100. Finally, Table 62 (p138) provides clues about annual recruitment, which was calculated as proportion of new breeders each year. We omitted Richdaleâ€™s data for the 1936 season and for the seasons following 1949, as he noted less frequent monitoring and incomplete data sets for the initial and the latter years of his study (
