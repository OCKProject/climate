<p class="p">Data were extracted from YEPDB as a series of SQL queries. Population numbers were retrieved from the table holding nest records. Number of breeding adults was calculated by multiplying the number of nests by two; number of fledglings is the sum of chicks fledged from all nests, and number of new breeders represents the sum of all adults that were recorded for the first time as breeders. Where possible we determined age of breeding birds per year by querying their banding details; age is unknown for birds banded as adults (ca. 15% of all banded birds).</p>
