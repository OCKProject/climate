<p class="p">To estimate demographic parameters, we first extracted ID numbers for individuals banded at the Boulder Beach complex since 1982. Secondly, we identified the years in which each bird was recorded as a breeding adult in the nest record table. Finally, we compiled the information from both database queries into a table where each column represented a nest year and rows comprised encounter histories for each individual. Birds had to miss at least two consecutive breeding seasons before being defined as dead or senescent. In a small number of cases a bird was not recorded as a breeder for three or more consecutive years before remerging as a nest occupant, but this applied to less than 1% of all birds.</p>
