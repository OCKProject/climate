<p class="p">We obtained monthly averages for selected climatic variables deemed likely to have an influence on demographic parameters (

Austral annual means were calculated for each parameter (i.e., July–June) as well as for the months March–May, which covers the penguins’ annual moult and post-moult periods. During this time birds are particularly susceptible to environmental perturbations due the increased energy requirements for feather replacement (

Data on local sea surface temperatures (SST) were obtained from the Portobello Marine Laboratory (University of Otago) which holds a near continuous time series of daily measurements dating back to January 1953. We calculated the monthly SST anomaly by subtracting monthly means from the average value calculated from all monthly means ranging from January 1953 to December 2014; annual SST anomaly is the mean of monthly SST anomalies for the corresponding year. To examine for potential lag effects of SST anomaly on prey availability (
