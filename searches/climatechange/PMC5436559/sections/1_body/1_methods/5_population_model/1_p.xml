<p class="p">We estimated adult survival and fledgling survival by developing a Bayesian mark-recapture (MR) model that incorporated effects of climate parameters. Chicks are only banded shortly before fledging, so that the MR model could not consider hatchlings that died before they were marked (i.e., chick survival). Hence, fledgling survival was adjusted by incorporating the proportion of chicks fledged to chicks hatched. We modelled survival in any year as a random process ranging around a mean of zero within the bounds of a total temporal variance. This allowed us to determine the relative importance of each climate covariate in terms of percentage of total variance explained (
