The effect of environmental factors on the population growth rate was examined by using fixed survival rates (means) within the population model, allowing it to approximate the deterministic population growth rate between 1982 and 2014. Similarly, we estimated the population growth rate by changing mean survival rates corresponding to low SSTs that were measured from 1982 to 1996, and high SSTs characteristic for the time period from 1997 to 2015. Finally, we projected future populations by running a series of stochastic projections that used a range of survival rate estimates (i.e., omitting years with increasing uncertainty in estimate validity) and predicted trends in influential environmental factors.
