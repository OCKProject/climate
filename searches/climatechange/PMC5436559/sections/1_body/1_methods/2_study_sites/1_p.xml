<p class="p">The Otago Peninsula penguin population has received considerable scientific attention in the past century, with Richdale conducting his seminal population research between 1936 and 1954 (

 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richdale, 1957</xref>), followed by a string of projects from the 1980s onwards addressing many aspects of the Yellow-eyed penguin’s biology including phylogeny (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Heezik, 1990</xref>), foraging ecology (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mattern et al., 2007</xref>), and conservation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ellenberg, Mattern &amp; Seddon, 2013</xref>). While Richdale conducted most of his work at Kumo Kumo Whero Bay, most of the recent research was carried out at the Boulder Beach complex (
