<p class="p">Numbers of adult breeders at Boulder Beach fluctuated considerably between 1982 and 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Immigration of birds that had been banded outside Boulder Beach was a rare occurrence throughout the study period (mean proportion of immigrants per year 1982–2015: 2.7 ± 2.2%). If birds banded as breeders are considered to have come from other breeding sites, the median immigration is similar (2.0%) although three years (1991, 2010 and 2012) would stand out where unbanded adults made up 11, 10 and 8% of the breeding population, respectively. An apparent rise in penguin numbers at the beginning of the monitoring period (i.e., 1982–1985) reflects increasing monitoring effort. Reduced monitoring effort may explain the drop in numbers after 1985–86; two areas were not monitored in several years (A1: 1986–1989; Highcliff: 1989). Both areas account for 46 ± 4% of penguin counts (1990–2015), so that true penguin numbers in 1989 were likely considerably higher than the database would suggest. Breeder numbers in the two areas monitored in 1989 (Midsection; Double Bay) dropped by 62% in the following season (1989: 74 birds, 1990: 28 birds) when the population was affected by a catastrophic adult die-off. The population recovered between 1990 and 1996 to reach levels comparable to those observed in 1985. The 1996 season had the highest numbers of breeders recorded at Boulder Beach (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 242) and represents a turning point for the population. Subsequently penguin numbers reached a low of 104 breeders in 2002, with losses compounded by another adult die-off event occurring in the 2001 season. Between 2002 and 2012 the population fluctuated between 100 and 150 breeders without any apparent trend before another drastic decline in numbers began in the years following a third adult die-off event at the end of the 2012 season. The steepest drop in numbers (41%) recorded since 1989 occurred between 2013 (128 breeders) and 2014 (76 breeders). In 2015, only 58 breeding penguins were recorded, which translates to a 76% decline in numbers since 1996.
