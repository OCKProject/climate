 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). However, significant variation between 2003 and 2010 reflects a series of years with poor breeding success followed by better reproductive output in the following year. Numbers of new breeders showed a similar albeit weakened pattern delayed by 5 years: starting in 2004, numbers of new breeders seem to mimic those of fledglings beginning in 1999.
