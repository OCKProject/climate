<p class="p">With projected SST increases over the next decades it seems doubtful that optimal marine conditions supporting the recovery of YEPs will occur in the future. Hence, future die-off events will be increasingly critical for penguin numbers. However, sea surface temperatures only explained about one third of the variation in survival rates. This means that other factors also play important roles for YEP population dynamics.</p>
