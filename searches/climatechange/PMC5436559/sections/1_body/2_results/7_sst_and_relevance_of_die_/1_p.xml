<p class="p">Die-off events do not seem to be related to prey availability; body condition of adult penguins examined during the 1989 event did not indicate malnutrition (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill &amp; Darby, 1993</xref>). The cause of mortality could not be identified although necropsies after the 2012 die-off indicated it to be toxin related (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gartrell et al., 2016</xref>). Harmful algal blooms (HAB) that are known to have negative impacts on other penguin species (
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shumway, Allen &amp; Boersma, 2003</xref>) were suspected to be involved in the die-offs as well (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill &amp; Darby, 1993</xref>). Yet water samples taken along a transect through the penguin’s known foraging ranges found no evidence for the presence of harmful algae (P Seddon, 2013, unpublished data). Tests for the presence of marine biotoxins in freshly dead birds were negative (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gartrell et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it seems unlikely that a HAB would selectively affect only one seabird species (
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shumway, Allen &amp; Boersma, 2003</xref>); no other unexplained seabird deaths occurred during any of the die-offs. Only bottom foraging YEPs were affected suggesting that the distribution of a toxin was probably limited to the near-seafloor region. Stratification and the disruption of vertical mixing potentially would contribute to a concentration of toxic components at the sea floor. While the origin or exact nature of the toxin remains unclear, it could be related to technical malfunctions that occurred at the time at Dunedin’s sewage treatment plant, which discharges at the seafloor about 1.5 km from the shore and ca. 5 km upstream from Boulder Beach (Dunedin City Council, 2013, unpublished data).
