<p class="p">Although the cause of die-off events remains a matter of speculation, their relevance for population trends is closely tied to prevalent environmental conditions following these events. The 1989 die-off, which removed about 50% of penguins from the breeding population (

Following this event, the population showed no sign of recovery during a prolonged period of warmer-than-normal SST that began in 1998 and prevails until today. The associated reduced adult survival explains the lack of recovery in the penguin population. Consequently, the 2012 die-off had a cumulative effect, further reducing the population to its lowest level on record.
