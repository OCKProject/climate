<p class="p">Introduced terrestrial predators are one of the biggest challenges for native wildlife in New Zealand (

 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ratz &amp; Murphy, 1999</xref>), but it is very difficult to quantify these effects because direct evidence of predation is sparse. A five year study investigating the impact of feral cats on penguins on Stewart Island did not find any indication for predation events and concluded that starvation and disease were the main factor of mortality (
