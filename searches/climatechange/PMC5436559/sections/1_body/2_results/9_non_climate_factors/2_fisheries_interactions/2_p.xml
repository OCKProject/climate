<p class="p">The impact of single fisheries interactions might have a much greater effect on penguin numbers than annual fishing statistics would suggest. There are reports of multiple YEP killed in a single gill net haul (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ellenberg &amp; Mattern, 2012</xref>) and reported bycatch incidents in gill net fisheries have been as high as 12 cases per year, many of which affected YEPs from the Otago Peninsula (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Darby &amp; Dawson, 2000</xref>). Currently, less than 2% of gill net effort in New Zealand is being independently observed (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richard &amp; Abraham, 2015</xref>); this lack of observer coverage prevents reliable quantification of bycatch mortality. Yet it stands to reason that incidental fisheries mortality is an important factor affecting penguin survival rates and, hence, population trends.
