 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mattern et al., 2013</xref>) could not be quantified because data on gill net fisheries supplied by the Ministry of Primary Industries (NZ Ministry Of Primary Industries, Official Information Act Request OIA12-397) proved to be spatially coarse and temporally limited, with approximate locations of gill net fishing events specified only from 2006 onwards. Provided data on bottom fishing effort only covered the years 2000–2012 and originated from vessels operating outside the penguins’ ranges (OIA12-460).
