<p class="p">In the past decade several breeding seasons saw the occurrence of diphtheritic stomatitis, a secondary infection negatively affecting chick survival (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Houston &amp; Hocken, 2005</xref>). We could not test the effects of such disease outbreaks on population trends, because the YEP database does not facilitate quantitative storage of disease-related data. Diphtheritic stomatitis only affects chicks which generally survive when older than two weeks (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alley et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the disease is unlikely to have a lasting effect on population trends as it does not affect adults which are critical for the maintenance of a stable population (

 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Graczyk et al., 1995</xref>), observed infections are low, hence, avian malaria currently does not present a significant problem for the species (
