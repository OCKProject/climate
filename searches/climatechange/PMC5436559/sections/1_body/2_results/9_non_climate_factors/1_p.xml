<p class="p">In this study we were able to use comprehensive data to test the influence of a wide range of climate related factors on the population developments of Yellow-eyed penguins from Boulder Beach. Yet only about a third of the variation in penguin numbers can be explained by climate factors. Hence, it is clear that other, non-climate factors significantly affect penguin survival rates. While several of these factors are well known, it is impossible to examine their impact on the penguin population in a modelling context due to a lack of any quantifiable data. At the same time, unlike the effects of climate change, at least some of these non-climatic factors could be managed on a regional scale to enhance the speciesâ€™ chance for survival. Therefore it is imperative to discuss some of these non-climate factors to avoid an undue focus on only the quantifiable factors (i.e., those driven by climate change) and direct conservation management towards measures that can ensure persistence of the Yellow-eyed penguin on the New Zealand mainland.</p>
