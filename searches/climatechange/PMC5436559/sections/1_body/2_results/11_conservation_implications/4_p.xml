<p class="p">The virtual absence of quantifiable data to examine the effects of non-climate factors makes it difficult to provide evidence-based management recommendations and puts a potentially overbearing emphasis on climate change. However, these principally anthropogenic factors likely also explain significant portions of the variation in survival rates, so that the focus should be on improving our understanding and management of these impacts to enhance this speciesâ€™ resilience to climate change.</p>
