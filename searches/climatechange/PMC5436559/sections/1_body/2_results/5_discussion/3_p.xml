<p class="p">When the 2012 die-off of adult breeding birds occurred, penguin numbers were less than 60% of what they had been in the mid-1990s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). While the penguin population showed a remarkable recovery after the 1989 event this did not happen following 2012; instead numbers have continued to decline. The most apparent differences following the two die-offs are the trends in ocean temperatures with a cooler-than-normal period in the first half of the 1990s whereas SST has been almost continuously higher than the 1953-2014 average since the late 1990s (
