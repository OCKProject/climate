<p class="p">Numbers of Yellow-eyed penguins at Boulder Beach have declined since 1996 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Figs. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" class="xref">6</xref>). The local population seemed to experience a reprieve from this decline in the first decade of the new millennium, despite unfavourable climatic conditions at that time. This might have been driven by a temporary reduction in other, non-climate negative impacts, the nature of which remain unclear due to a lack of data.
