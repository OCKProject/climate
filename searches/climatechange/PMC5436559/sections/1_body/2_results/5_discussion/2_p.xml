<p class="p">The ages of breeding penguins provide some explanation about the underlying mechanics of the population decline. In the years following the 1989 and 2001 adult die-offs, the average age of new breeders recruited into the population was substantially higher than in the years prior to the events. All of these birds were locally banded individuals, which suggests that there was a pool of older, previously unpaired birds which replaced experienced breeders that had died during the event. After the 2012 die-off, the mean age of new breeders reached an historic low (4.1 years, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Hence, old breeders that had lost their partner now paired up with younger penguins indicating that the pool of older non-breeders available to replace lost birds had disappeared. This is supported by the number of recruits reflecting the marked variation in fledgling numbers with a 5-year-lag (

This likely has negative effects on breeding performance since in seabirds age is an important determinant for foraging success (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nisbet &amp; Dann, 2009</xref>). The decline in the mean age of new breeders in recent years indicates that more inexperienced birds are recruiting as breeders, and possibly explains the overall deteriorating reproductive success.
