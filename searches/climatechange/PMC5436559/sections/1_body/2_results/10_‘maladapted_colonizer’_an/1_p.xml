<p class="p">Comprehensive analysis of ancient penguin DNA in recent years have revealed that the YEP is relatively recent colonizer originating from sub-Antarctic. The species is believed to have replaced a sister taxon 
 <italic class="italic">Megadyptes waitaha</italic> after it was hunted to extinction by humans as recently as 500 years ago (

 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rawlence et al., 2015</xref>). In this light, the question was raised whether the species’ vulnerability to increasing ocean temperatures may in fact reflect a maladaptation for a warmer climate (
 <xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Waters &amp; Grosser, 2016</xref>). While evidence for a physiological relationship between ocean warming and survival rates in YEP is lacking, the specialized benthic foraging strategy renders the species particularly sensitive to environmental change (

 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallagher et al., 2015</xref>). With the various non-climatic factors discussed above all contributing to significant shifts across the entire benthic ecosystem, reducing the penguins’ struggle to a species-specific maladaptation for a warming climate clearly oversimplifies the matter.
