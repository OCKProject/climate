 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beentjes et al., 2002</xref>). Warmer than usual SST is often an indication of increased stratification of the water column where a layer of warmer water sits on top of cooler water. This disrupts the benthic-pelagic coupling, i.e., mixing processes that regulate nutrient flow between benthos and surface waters (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Land run-off has been identified as a major source of nutrients for the South Otago continental shelf, which results in higher near-surface nutrient concentrations (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hawke, 1989</xref>), so that vertical mixing is likely of crucial importance for benthic productivity and subsequent prey abundance in the penguinsâ€™ home ranges. Penguin foraging conditions are likely compromised under stratified, warm-water conditions.
