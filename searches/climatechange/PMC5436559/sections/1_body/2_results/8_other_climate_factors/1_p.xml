<p class="p">Daily minimum air temperature is a proxy for prevailing temperature regimes, where a higher average minimum temperature indicates warmer years. Air temperature could simply be a covariate of SST and affect penguin survival through the mechanisms suggested above. In addition, air temperatures recorded during the moult (Marchâ€“May) negatively affected adult survival probably as a result of hyperthermia. Little penguins in Australia suffer increased adult mortality when exposed to higher temperatures when moulting (
