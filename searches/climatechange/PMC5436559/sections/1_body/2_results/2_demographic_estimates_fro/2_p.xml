<p class="p">Years with increased wind activity had a positive effect on fledgling survival, whereas the effect of higher than normal SST was negative; both covariates explained 33.2% of the variance (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3A</xref>, ID 1 &amp; 2). Similarly, SST anomaly during the first three months after fledging as well as in the previous year both had a negative effect on survival, explaining 24.8% and 17.4% of the variance (IDs 3 &amp; 4), while increased wind activity in the months after fledging had a positive effect on fledgling survival (16.5% of variance explained, ID 5). Furthermore, years with above average air temperatures had a negative effect on fledgling survival, explaining 12.4% and 15.4% of the variance (IDs 6 &amp; 7).
