<p class="p">In adults, SST had the greatest effect on the survival rate, explaining 36.8% of the variance (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">Table 3B</xref>, ID 1). The relationship of adult survival and SST becomes apparent when the deviation of annual adult survival from the median survival rate is plotted against SST anomaly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). In periods with cooler than usual SST, adult survival was high (e.g., 1990–1996), whereas warm periods were characterized by lower adult survival. The same was true for air temperature. Warmer years were associated with reduced adult survival; air temperature-related covariates explained 34.4% of the variation in adult survival (
