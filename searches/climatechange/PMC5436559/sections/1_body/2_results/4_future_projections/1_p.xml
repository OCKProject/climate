<p class="p">Based on projections of increasing SST at a rate of 0.02 °C per year in the next decades (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oliver et al., 2014</xref>), the penguin population at Boulder Beach will continue to decline. Stochastic simulations using the most reliable estimates for adult survival (1982–2012) suggest that the number of adult female penguins will drop below 10 individuals by 2,048 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). If the recent poor breeding years 2013–2015 are included this negative trend gets progressively worse. Including adult survival rates estimated for 2015, the mean projection predicts YEPs to be locally extinct by 2043.
