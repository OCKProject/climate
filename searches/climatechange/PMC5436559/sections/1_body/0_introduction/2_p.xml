<p class="p">For species conservation, this creates a daunting scenario. With resources for conservation often limited, the inevitability of climate change could be used as an argument against taking action to conserve species at locations that may become sub-optimal due to environmental change (

However, often cumulative anthropogenic impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, pollution, resource competition, accidental mortality) significantly add to—or even exceed—the impact of climate-related environmental change (

 <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trathan et al., 2015</xref>). While climate change is a global issue that is difficult to tackle at a regional scale, addressing local-scale anthropogenic factors can enhance species’ resilience to environmental change. Quantifiable data on climate variables are usually readily available through international and regional monitoring programmes (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kriticos et al., 2012</xref>), whereas this is generally not the case with other non-climate related data. Lack of monitoring or commercial interests often prevent the compilation of data (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mesnil et al., 2009</xref>) which may be relevant to species survival. This creates the risk of an analytical bias towards climate impacts, thereby distracting from and potentially understating non-climate threats.
