<p class="p">Using population data recorded between 1982 and 2015 from one of the YEPâ€™s mainland strongholds, we developed a population model that integrates observed population changes with key climatic variables. While climate data are readily available as continuous data sets, data on anthropogenic factors are often sparse or of low temporal and spatial resolution which inhibits quantitative analysis. We assess to which extent population trends can be attributed to climate change so as to highlight and discuss the likely importance of other, not readily quantifiable but more manageable threats.</p>
