 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patz et al., 1998</xref>) can be found on seasonality in the current literature for European DEP or dengue risk over an extended time period under all climate change scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the only study on the European DEP communicating findings at the monthly time scale over two centuries including historical observations and four climate projections into the future. This information is important for dengue control planning and may in turn underscore the need for emissions reductions, echoing and supporting ratification of the Paris Agreement, a treaty on greenhouse gas emission reductions formed at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (
