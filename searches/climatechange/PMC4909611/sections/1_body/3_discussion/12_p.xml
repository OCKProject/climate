These relationships may vary depending on the environmental conditions of the study location/laboratory/design, vector and virus types. The uncertainty of each parameter and its temperature dependent relation were not available. Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the uncertainty for each parameter and their effect on

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> corresponding to infectious period of 4 to 10 days), the estimated intensity and duration for DEP should be viewed with caution. If different threshold values were used, the general trend and order of cities that would go over the threshold will hold, but the exact decade when the DEP goes over the threshold could change. However, using the threshold of 0.2 day
