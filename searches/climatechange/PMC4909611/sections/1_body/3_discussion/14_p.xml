<p class="p">Finally, the temperature data used from CRU and CMIP5 are monthly averages over gridded area of 0.5 × 0.5°. While the daily datasets from E-OBS for the maps in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> have finer resolution (0.25 × 0.25°, daily), coarser resolutions (CRU and CMIP5) may underestimate DEP during the summer and overestimate during the winter for cities located along the costal lines. This accounts for the differences observed between 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> for major cities. Much of our analyses were based on outputs from the coarser temperature data sets (CRU and CMIP5). Therefore, the conclusions drawn are more conservative for the summer and overestimates for the winter (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> intensity). See Supplementary Information (Sections S1 &amp; S2) for more discussion.
