<p class="p">The limitations of this study are mainly the assumptions made and parameters/data used for estimating the DEP through 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>. First, we assumed that the female vector-to-human population ratio (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>) depends on temperature only. This is not exactly true in reality because vector populations change with the season due to climate including rainfall, vector ecology and control, etc. (

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hales et al., 1996</xref>) The reason for making this assumption is that neither reliable data nor their temperature and rainfall dependent relationships are available. In addition, rainfall is known to affect the under-water stages of vector development (
