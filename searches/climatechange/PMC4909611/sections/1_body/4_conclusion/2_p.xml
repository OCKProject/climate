<p class="p">We identified past, present, and future high-risk cities and time periods for potential dengue transmission in Europe based on temperature and daily temperature variation. Compared to countries where dengue is endemic, Europe showed strong seasonality in dengue epidemic potential (DEP) without possibility of year-round epidemic transmission. Compared over two centuries, we found a slow increase in intensity and duration of dengue transmission over the past century and more rapidly changing trajectories projected in the 21st century with the rate of change depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions. Although Europe currently does not have a sufficiently high DEP year round, increasing periods with higher temperatures and greater temperature variation in the future due to climate change could elevate DEP along a south to north gradient. By the end of this century, DEP for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, could expand to Northern Europe (all 10 cities studied) and up to eight months in Southern Europe under the highest emission pathway (RCP 8.5). Under the lowest emission pathway (RCP 2.6), it could expand to Nice and Paris for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> from the current three Southern European cities. For 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> DEP could expand to all of the Central Europe (7 cities) under RCP 8.5; however, it would remain nearly as it is now under RCP 2.6 (three Southern Europe cities). Therefore, climate change mitigation (or lack thereof) could have a large impact on the seasonal window and geographic range for dengue transmission potential in Europe. Under the higher emission scenarios, increasingly larger parts of Europe would have the potential for autochthonous dengue transmission should

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> if higher greenhouse gas emissions than RCP2.6 would be realized.
