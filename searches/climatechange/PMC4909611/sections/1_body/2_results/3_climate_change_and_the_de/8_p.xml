In the coming decades, under RCP2.6, there is little increase from the current to the future – only five cities (Málaga, Athens, Rome, Nice and Paris by 2020s) could have sufficient DEP. If RCP8.5 were to be realized, Paris would have sufficient DEP (2020s), followed by Madeira and Berlin (2030s), London (2060s), Amsterdam (2070s), and Stockholm (2080s). Therefore, by the end of this century, five cities under RCP2.6 and all 10 cities under RCP8.5 could have sufficient DEP – an
