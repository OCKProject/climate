<p class="p">In general, increasing trends in intensity and duration for DEP were observed in all cities. The intensity and duration markedly increased from 1970 to 2019 under both RCPs and for both vectors, except for the three Southern European cities: Malága, Athens and Rome, where intensity remained nearly constant due to decreasing sensitivity to slight temperature changes around the peak temperature for

From 2020 to the end of this century, this increase in intensity and duration is projected to level off under RCP2.6, while continuing to increase rapidly under RCP8.5 for both vectors, leading to very different projected trends.
