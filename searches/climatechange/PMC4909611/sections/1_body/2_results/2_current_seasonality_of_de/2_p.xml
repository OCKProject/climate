 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> shows the season-stratified maps of Europe's DEP during the recent decade (2006–2015) for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>(i)) compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>(ii)) and current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae.</italic> vectors either introduced or established (

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). Currently Europe is infested by 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> mainly in the Mediterranean area but expanding northward, while only three areas have recently reported 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, Georgia and southwestern portions of Russia, in addition to Madeira Island, Portugal (not shown on map) (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). The threshold value of 0.2 day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> corresponds to yellow color (see color bar). In areas with 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> above this threshold (yellow-orange to dark red) during a given time period, dengue outbreaks may commence assuming prerequisite populations of vectors, susceptible human hosts, and virus introduction coincide. Areas during time periods displayed in blue to yellow green would not be expected to be suitable for dengue outbreaks to begin even if vectors were present and importations of dengue virus were persistent. Strong seasonality is apparent: 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> was not sufficiently high in Europe in the winter, spring, and autumn seasons to allow dengue epidemic transmission to commence using the threshold value of 0.2 day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>, except for small areas in the very southern parts of Southern Europe during spring and autumn. In the summer season, the majority of continental Europe for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and southern and partially central parts of Europe for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> have climate conditions and corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> that could sustain seasonal dengue epidemics. Therefore, if the primary vector, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, established in the other parts of Europe in the future, it could have greater DEP than the established and invasive secondary vector, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>.
