<p class="p">We compared 10 cities in Europe with three reference cities in tropical and sub-tropical regions. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> shows 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> averaged per month over the recent 10 years for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (a) and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (b). General decreases in 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> were observed comparing the temperate European cities to the tropics, and the subtropics. Singapore and Colombo showed high and nearly constant year-round 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>. Miami showed a broad peak from May to October, with 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> values over the threshold (0.2 day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) year-round, indicating dengue epidemic transmission was theoretically possible. All European cities showed a strong and narrow seasonal transmission potential with overall lower 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> values. Cities in Southern Europe exhibited higher and broader peaks in 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> than the rest of Europe. 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> showed higher 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>. Seven out of the 10 European cities were over the threshold for at least one month of the year for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>; only four cities were over the threshold for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>. For both vectors, no single city in Europe had sufficiently high 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> to initiate endemic dengue transmission during the winter months. Therefore, during the past decade a dengue epidemic was possible only during the warmer months of the year in all three Southern European cities for both vectors and in some Central European cities for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> based on the CRU temperature data as input. Notice that this result based on monthly temperature is lower than the results shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> using daily temperature as input – see limitation of this study in 
 <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Discussion</xref> section and Section S1 in Supplementary information for more discussion. The rest of the results were based on monthly temperature.
