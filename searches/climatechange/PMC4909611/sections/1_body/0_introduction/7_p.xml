<p class="p">In this study, we modeled 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> to project DEP in Europe given changes in climate. Throughout this study, we have included DTR in all of our 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> calculations. We expanded our previous relative 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> model to 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>, by including temperature dependent dynamics in the female vector-to-human population ratio (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>) for both 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> under four projected emission scenarios with higher temporally and spatially resolution over two centuries. We estimated DEP for local dengue transmission, in terms of seasonality, intensity and duration, for Europe and examined ten European metropolitan cities ranging from North to South for the period 1901â€“2099 (for more details see Table S3 in the Supplementary information).
