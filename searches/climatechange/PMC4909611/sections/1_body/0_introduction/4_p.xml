<p class="p">Of major concern is the geographic expansion of dengue viruses and vectors to new areas (

 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">World Health Organization (WHO), 2009</xref>). Reasons for the expansion are complex; however, main contributing factors include the introduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes by shipping (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reiter, 1998</xref>) and increasingly importation of the dengue virus via viremic travelers (

 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wilder-Smith and Gubler, 2008</xref>). Subsequent establishment of vectors after introduction can only be possible if suitable climate and ecological conditions exist. Having established populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> vectors and the conducive climatic conditions, in early autumn 2014, Tokyo, Japan recorded the first epidemic of dengue since the Second World War (
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Quam et al., 2016</xref>). Europe is also suitable for the establishment and re-establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as evidenced by the following: 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> was historically present in many European countries including UK and France (1919), Spain (up to 1953), Portugal (up to 1956), and recently the Netherlands, Russia and Georgia (

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). In Madeira, Portugal, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> was documented until 1977â€“79 and then was re-established in 2004 and 2005. Madeira experienced its first major dengue outbreak in 2012/2013, with more than 2000 cases (

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wilder-Smith et al., 2014a</xref>). The rapidly expanding range of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> in Europe (

 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">La Ruche et al., 2010</xref>) in addition to an importation

 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rezza et al., 2007</xref>). There are concerns that 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> could be introduced from Russia and Georgia (Abkhazia) to Western Europe via air or sea traffic, and to Eastern Europe via road and sea traffic, in addition to the vectors' projected establishment in Southern Europe (
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rogers, 2015</xref>). Current surveillance indicates that 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> vectors have been introduced or established in much of the Mediterranean coast and as far north as the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to assess the dengue epidemic potential (DEP) in Europe.
