<p class="p">The six vector parameters used were 1) the average vector biting rate (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>), 2) the probability of vector to human transmission per bite (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">h</italic>
 </sub>), 3) the probability of human to vector infection per bite (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 </sub>), 4) the duration of the extrinsic incubation period – EIP (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>), 5) the vector mortality rate (
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 </sub>), and 6) the female vector-to-human population ratio (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>). The time unit is one day. Each of the vector parameters depends on temperature (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). The temperature relationships for the first five vector parameters, 1)–5), were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>; details are described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). For 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>, only two vector parameters, 1) and 5), were found in the literature with temperature dependent relationships: the mortality rate (
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 </sub>) and the total biting rate (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>), which was taken as an inverse of the duration of gonotrophic cycle (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delatte et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining three parameters, 2)–4), in the 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> were assumed to have the same temperature relation as those for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). For 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. Albopictus</italic>, the human biting rate is assumed to be 0.88 of the total biting rate based on the human and dogs experiment performed by 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delatte et al. (2010)</xref>. The probability of transmission per bite to human is assumed to be 0.7 of that for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, based partially on the literature review conducted by 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lambrechts et al. (2010)</xref>. Due to a lack of reliable data, the female vector-to-human population ratio, 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>, is assumed to depend on temperature the same way as the life expectancy or inverse of the mortality rate, as used in a previous study (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). The maximum value of 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) is assumed to be 1.5.
