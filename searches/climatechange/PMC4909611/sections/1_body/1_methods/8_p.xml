<p class="p">From the Climate Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5 × 0.5 degrees) monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) were obtained for Europe for the period January 1, 1901 to December 31, 2013 (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., n.d.</xref>). Given the importance of DTR to temperate European climate, in all the 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> calculations, diurnal temperature range (DTR) was included. DTR was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature for each 30 min through a piece-wise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean observations for each location (same temperature for each day of the month in each 0.5 × 0.5 grid – See Supplementary information S3 for details). To illustrate the combined effect of DTR and mean temperature to
