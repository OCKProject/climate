<p class="p">The threshold cut-off for DEP was defined as

 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> reaches a level such that one infected person will infect at least one more person after dengue is introduced into a naïve population during his/her five-day infectious period (

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>). This corresponds to a range of thresholds for DEP from 0.1 to 0.25 (day

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>), which is closer to the higher end of this range, to be conservative in our results presented.
