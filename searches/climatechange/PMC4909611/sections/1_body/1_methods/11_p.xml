<p class="p">Sensitivity analyses were carried out and the results were included in the Supplementary Information, where section and figure numbers were marked with “S”. Using Monte Carlo simulations, 95% Credible Intervals (CI) (
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pericchi and Walley, 1991</xref>) of 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> were estimated for temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 32.5 °C. The variability in each of the six vector parameters was simulated assuming a normal random distribution. At each temperature under the random generation of parameters, 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> was calculated based on Eq. 
 <xref rid="fo0005" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(1)</xref>. Repeating this process 1000 times for each temperature, the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> were estimated to give the values of 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> ± 95% CI. Using the fitting functions (
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> ± 95% CI vs. temperature) as the basic equations and temperature data as input, we estimated 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> ± 95% CI for the ten cities over two centuries, including DTR (Section S5.1–5.2, Figs. S3–S4 and Table S2 in Supplementary information). In addition, sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> to threshold values (
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>*) and the maximum value of the female vector-to-human population ratio (
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) were also estimated based on Eq. 
 <xref rid="fo0005" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(1)</xref>. We compared three values: 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>* = 0.1, 0.2, 0.25 day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> based on the infectious period of 4 to 10 days. The results were expressed as dengue transmission duration over the rest of this century for two RCPs (Fig. S5). We varied 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in three values: 1, 1.5, and 2, which was chosen to reflect partially the range of pupae-to-human population ratio (0.3 to 60) for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Focks et al., 2000</xref>). The results were expressed as the seasonality curves (averaged 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> vs. months) over the recent decade for selected 13 cities (Fig. S6), and transmission intensity and duration over the two centuries for two RCPs (Figs. S7–S8) in the Supplementary information.
