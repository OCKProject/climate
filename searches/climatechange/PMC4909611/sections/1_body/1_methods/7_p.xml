 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>). Inclusion of DTR in modeling DEP for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> using relative 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">rVC</italic>) has shown a great difference comparing without DTR (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>), especially in the cold to temperate climate zones in Northern hemisphere. This is because 
 <italic class="italic">rVC</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic>) depends on DTR strongly, both the peak intensity and the position. When DTR increases from 0 °C to 20 °C, the peak height of 
 <italic class="italic">rVC</italic> reduced from 1.37 to 0.47 day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>; the peak position of 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> reduces from 29 °C to 20 °C. Therefore, in models including DTR, temperate climate zones with larger DTR will have greater DEP, while tropical areas with less DTR will have lesser DEP than estimated by models using mean temperature alone. This is particularly relevant to Europe, where DTR is greater than tropical areas.
