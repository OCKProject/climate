<p class="p">To calculate the intensity and duration of dengue transmission, a seasonality curve was generated by plotting the decadally averaged 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> as a function of month for each of the 10 cities first and then for each decade over the two centuries. The intensity of DEP was estimated by averaging the 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> over the highest three consecutive months in the seasonality curve. The duration of transmission season was estimated by the intersections of the seasonality curve with the line defining the threshold condition (
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> = 0.2 (day
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>)). The differences between the two intersections gave the number of months that 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> was over the threshold. This was repeated for each decade over the two centuries and for each of the 10 European cities. Over the two centuries decadally averaged 
 <italic class="italic">VC</italic> were from year zero to nine for each decade except the two decades with 9-year period: 1901–1909, 2011–2019 due to that both CRU and CMIP5 data started from year one in the data set: 1901 and 2011.
