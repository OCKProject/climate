 <p class="p">Globalization and climate change can increase the geographic spread of vector-borne diseases. Among those, dengue, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, causes up to 390 million human infections annually. This study evaluates potential for dengue outbreaks in Europe based on climate conditions. Estimated suitability (1901–2099) for dengue outbreaks is expanding presently from Southern Europe northward and lengthening seasonally up to eight months around the summer; however, the projected extent, intensity and duration depend partially on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that limiting emissions thereby mitigating climate change could substantially reduce the likelihood of dengue transmission events in Europe during the 21st century.</p>
