 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1a</xref>) were studied during the breeding season (mid-July/mid-August) from 2004 to 2015. Birds breed under rocks in steep boulder fields, where they raise a single offspring. Adult birds fly out to sea where they forage on zooplankton, which they bring back to their chick in a sublingual pouch. During the inter-breeding period (Sept-May), birds migrate to wintering areas in the North Atlantic, notably off Newfoundland

 </sup>. Each summer, a set of biological parameters detailed below were monitored, and sample sizes are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Adult birds were caught either in their nest or on the surrounding rocks using a lasso or noose carpets. Breeding status was assessed by the presence of a chick, a full sublingual pouch or a brood patch. Handling time was &lt;10 min. For all sampling except for the survival study (see below), each year different individuals were studied. Therefore, our investigations were mainly conducted at the population – and not at the individual – level.
