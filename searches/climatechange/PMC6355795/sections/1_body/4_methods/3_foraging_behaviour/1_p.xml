Breeding adults were equipped with temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) attached ventrally, recording at 0.2, 0.5 or 1 Hz for 2–5 d during the chick-rearing period. Details on TDR types and attachment methods are presented in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. Data were analyzed with MultiTrace™ to extract maximum dive depth, dive and pause duration for each dive. Depth was corrected for Star Oddi devices because they showed a slight underestimation of depth according to a calibration made in Amélineau
