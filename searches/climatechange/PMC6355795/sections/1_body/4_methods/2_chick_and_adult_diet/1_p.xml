<p id="Par30" class="p">Breeding adults were captured on arrival at the colony and the content of their sublingual pouch (chick diet) was removed and stored either in 4% borax-buffered formaldehyde solution (2005 to 2007) or in 70% ethanol (2008 and beyond). Samples were identified to the lowest possible taxonomical level under a stereomicroscope following groups presented in Harding

 </sup>. Blood samples (0.3 ml) were collected from bird brachial vein, stored in 70% ethanol and kept frozen at −20 °C. Prior to analyses, blood samples were freeze-dried for 48 h and homogenized. Stable isotope analyses were then performed on ~0.5 mg subsamples of homogenized, non-lipid extracted whole blood loaded into tin cups, and using an elemental analyzer (Flash EA 1112, Thermo Fisher) coupled in continuous flow mode to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta V Advantage, Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). Stable isotope abundances were expressed in δ notation as the deviation from standards in parts per thousand (‰) according to the equation: δX = [(Rsample/Rstandard) − 1] × 1000 where X is 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C or 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N and R is the corresponding ratio 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C/
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>C or 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N/
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>N. Standard values were Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) for C and atmospheric N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (air) for N. Replicate measurements of internal laboratory standards (acetanilide) indicated that the measurement error was &lt;0.2% for both δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values.
