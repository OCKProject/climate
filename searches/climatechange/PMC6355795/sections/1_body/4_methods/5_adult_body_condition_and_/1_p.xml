<p id="Par33" class="p">Each handled adult was weighed (g), and wing and head-bill lengths were measured (mm). We constructed a body condition index, correcting adult body mass by wing length and head-bill length to take bird size into account. The body condition index was calculated as the residual body mass from a regression of body mass on wing length and head-bill length
