Yearly winter environmental conditions (wind speed, SST) were calculated as a mean value within the core wintering area from November to February from monthly values of the datasets mentioned above. In addition, we calculated the proportion of days with high winds (mean daily wind speed &gt; 40 km/h) during the same period, using daily wind speeds from the Metop/ASCAT data set (0.25° resolution). Data for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) came from the UCAR and were acquired from
