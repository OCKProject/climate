<p id="Par35" class="p">One plot of the colony was dedicated to a capture-mark-recapture experiment. Birds (n = 333) were marked with a unique code composed of 3 colour rings and one metal ring. Each season, recapture sessions lasted 6 d with 7 h of continuous observation per day. Data were analyzed using a capture-recapture model

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>
 </sup> with E-SURGE. We first built a structural model without any external covariate. To define the structural model, we first did single state goodness-of-fit tests (GOF, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) using U-CARE

 </sup>. Only the 2.CT test was significant, indicating a difference in the probability of being recaptured at i + 1 for birds seen and not seen at occasion i. In order to take into account recapture heterogeneity among marked birds, we used a model with two classes of capture

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>
 </sup> and defined three states: individuals with a high recapture probability, individuals with a low recapture probability and dead individuals. Changes of state between high and low recapture probability were not permitted. Such a structure explained our data better than a model including trap-dependence or allowing changes of recapture probability through time (if, for example, this was linked to breeding status). Biologically, recapture heterogeneity was due to the structure of the colony, where some birds nest in areas where it is more difficult to see them enter and leave their burrows. Such a model with recapture heterogeneity was used for least auklets (

 </sup>. The model selection was conducted with E-SURGE

 </sup>. The general starting model was (φ(t), p(het.t)), where “het” denotes the heterogeneous effect on capture with two levels (seen with a high or low probability), t denotes the time effect. Models were selected based on Akaike

 </sup> Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for sample sizes and overdispersion (QAICc). During first step, we selected the best model with only time and state as explanatory variables. In step two, we included environmental variables (one or two at a time
