<p id="Par38" class="p">All analyses were performed with the R software (v. 3.4.2; R core team 2017). We adopted an hypothesis-based approach to study the link between environmental variables and biological parameters, i.e. we tested specific linear models with one or two explanatory variables at a time that are meaningful in a biological context, instead of testing all possible combinations of factors. This ensured to reduce type 1 errors, and to avoid overfitting, as well as issues regarding autocorrelation among environmental variables

 </sup>. In particular, summer SIC, summer SST and summer wind were highly related (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Among these environmental variables, SIC was selected as the main environmental parameter to test, due to its strong and direct influence on the foraging behaviour of little auks at our study site. Mean yearly Hg concentrations in head or body feathers were considered as environmental variables reflecting Hg found in the environment in winter and in the previous summer, respectively

 </sup>. Hg was either tested independently when a direct influence is expected (chick growth rate and hatching date), or tested concomitantly with SIC when it is expected to be an additional stress factor (adult body condition). We also investigated temporal variations of biological parameters.”Day of year” was included in the models with adult body condition as a response variable as body mass is slightly decreasing along the breeding season.
