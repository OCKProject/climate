<p id="Par39" class="p">For adult diet, foraging behaviour, adult body condition and chick growth rate, we performed linear regressions to model the relationship between biological variables and environmental variables, when the assumptions were met. We did not use mixed-effects models because each bird was only sampled one time. Results of the tests were considered significant when p-value was &lt;0.05. For changes in prey proportion in chick diet in relation to SIC, we first used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) as no linear curve was expected. We performed a logit transformation of the proportions (p): log((p + a)/(1 − (p + a)), and where 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> is a constant (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 0.1) in order to get a logit for all proportions including null values. Each GAM was then compared with a linear model and the model with the lower AIC was retained (all differences in AIC were greater than 2).
