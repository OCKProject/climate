<p id="Par8" class="p">Over the period 2004–2015, mean summer SIC varied between 1.8 and 19.8% within the foraging range of little auks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), allowing us to study the links between ice conditions and little auk ecology. SIC was negatively related to sea-surface temperature (SST, n = 12, R² = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001, y = −6.1x + 13.6) and to wind speed (n = 8, R² = 0.57, p = 0.03, y = −1.3x + 42.9, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). No temporal trend was found for summer SIC during the study period, however, a decrease in SIC was found in the same area for the period 1979–2014
