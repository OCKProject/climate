 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Despite a 12-year long dataset, we were limited by gaps in some of our biological measures and environmental variables (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This prevented the use of a global approach with causal inference, such as path analysis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>
 </sup>. For this reason, we decided to apply a hypothesis-based approach to target specific questions. We therefore built independent regression models for each biological parameter studied, to test the effects of one or two environmental covariates at a time, to avoid overfitting
