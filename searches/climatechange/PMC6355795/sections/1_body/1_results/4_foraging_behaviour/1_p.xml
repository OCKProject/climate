<p id="Par11" class="p">Analysis of dive depths for all dives across the study period showed a bimodal pattern with two distinct peaks: one with dives &lt;7 m and one with dives between 10 and 40 m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Further investigations showed a link between diving behaviour and SIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Dives were deeper and the proportion of shallow dives (&lt;7 m) decreased when there was less ice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a,b</xref>; Maximum depth: n = 67, R² = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001, y = −0.40x + 21.7, Proportion of shallow dives: n = 67, R² = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001, y = 1.68x + 5.74). Dives were also longer and birds performed fewer dives per day when SIC decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c,d</xref>; Dive duration: n = 67, R² = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001, y = −0.91x + 63.0, Number of dives per 24 h: n = 61, R² = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001, y = 9.6x + 226.8). Birds spent slightly less time underwater and more time flying when SIC was low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6e,f</xref>; Time underwater: n = 61, R² = 0.09, p = 0.02, y = 0.31x + 17.0, Time spent flying: n = 53, R² = 0.12, p = 0.01, y = −0.62x + 38.0). There was no link between foraging trip duration and SIC (n = 53, R² = 0.004, p &gt; 0.1).
