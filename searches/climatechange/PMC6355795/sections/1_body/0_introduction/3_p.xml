<p id="Par4" class="p">In addition to these climatic and resource modifications, little auks could face large changes in the contamination of their environment. For instance, mercury (Hg) concentrations measured in little auks from East Greenland and reflecting the contamination of their environment have increased by 3.4% per year over the last decade
