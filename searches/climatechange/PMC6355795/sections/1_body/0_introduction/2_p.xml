<p id="Par3" class="p">In this study, we focused on little auks (
 <italic class="italic">Alle alle</italic>), the most abundant seabird breeding in the Arctic (estimated 40 to 80 million individuals
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>). Little auks are ecologically important in regional food webs
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup> and could be negatively impacted by ongoing environmental change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. Notably, little auks are zooplanktivorous, and the distribution of their main prey, Calanoid copepods, is changing along with the warming of the North Atlantic. As a result, the range of the smallest and less energy-rich species, 
 <italic class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</italic>, of Atlantic origin, is extending northwards
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. It may result in replacement of the two larger and energetically favoured Arctic species, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">glacialis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hyperboreus</italic>, that are preferred by little auks

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. Such a change could prevent birds from covering their energetic needs
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. Although previous studies highlighted that little auks from different colonies can demonstrate strong behavioural plasticity to foraging conditions and prey availability, these studies were performed at the scale of one or a few breeding seasons
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup> and longer term impacts are unknown. Furthermore, the largest little auk populations rely on sea-ice and polynya
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, which are likely to disappear soon from their summer foraging grounds according to IPCC predictions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, and this could further modify bird foraging behaviour and reproduction
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, changes in wind regimes could directly affect little auk energetics
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> and their capacity to respond to the aforementioned changes. At a broader spatial scale, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index reflects climatic conditions and is commonly used to test for the effects of climate on seabirds (e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>). The NAO index seems to be particularly well suited to studying the population dynamics of migrants that rely on climatic clues
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. As an example, survival of little auks breeding in Spitsbergen was linked to winter NAO with a time lag of 2 years, with negative effects on the birds being possibly mediated through varying intakes of little auk prey
