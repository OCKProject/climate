<p id="Par5" class="p">In this context, we propose to examine the multiannual behavioural plasticity of this species in response to environmental change and to investigate impacts on bird fitness. More specifically, and based on recent findings for little auks and their prey, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) the proportion of ice-associated prey in little auk chick diet is decreasing with decreasing sea-ice extent, and the proportion of

 </sup>. (2) Adult little auks modify their foraging behaviour to cope with a changing environment during summer, to maintain their body condition and the provisioning of their chicks, thereby also maintaining chick growth rates
