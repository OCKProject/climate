<p id="Par16" class="p">Using a unique dataset of biological parameters from a 12-year long-term monitoring program in East Greenland, we found that little auks are impacted by current environmental changes occurring in the Arctic. (1) As expected, the proportion of ice-associated species in chick diet was related to SIC, but the proportion of

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> (copepod of Atlantic origin) did not decrease with increasing SIC. (2) Despite substantial plasticity in foraging behaviour and diet, adult body condition and chick growth rates decreased when SIC increased. (3) Adult body condition and chick growth rate were negatively related to summer levels of mercury. (4) Despite these changes, adult survival was not linked to environmental variables.
