<p id="Par20" class="p">Changes in little auk diet reflect their preferences, as well as prey availability in the environment. Recent studies suggest that little auks favour larger and fattier species

 </sup> and, therefore, observed changes in prey proportions are likely to reflect the availability of larger prey species in the foraging range of birds. In the North Atlantic Arctic, it is predicted that smaller

 </sup>. However, proportions of little auk main prey, the three species of

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> slightly increased at higher SIC, and the proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">glacialis</italic> decreased at higher SIC. Underlying mechanisms driving zooplankton abundance at a given place are complex and do not depend solely on local summer SIC/SST, but might also vary with, for instance salinity and depth

 </sup> which were not included in this study. However, little auks have access to distant foraging areas spread over dozens of kilometers where depth and salinity and thus prey availability might vary substantially

 </sup>. In addition, it should be noted that although slightly increasing with SIC, the proportion of

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> in chick diet remained low in comparison to other 
 <italic class="italic">Calanus</italic> species, whatever the SIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Interestingly, despite no clear pattern in chick diet, adult diet shifted to a higher trophic level (higher δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N values) and to more offshore feeding habitats (lower δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values) during the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Such stable isotope analyses are particularly integrative and could therefore reflect fine changes occurring in the longer term among the zooplankton community. Moreover, it is still unclear whether adults and chicks feed on the exact same prey because the compositions of their diets have never been measured concomitantly. While stomach contents of adults are comparable to gular pouch samples
