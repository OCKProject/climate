 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Thereby, dives &lt;7 m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) probably reflected foraging directly underneath the sea ice, to feed on sympagic species such as 
 <italic class="italic">Apherusa glacialis</italic>, and indeed the proportion of this species in chick diet increased along with SIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). This was also supported by preliminary results concerning birds for which diving behaviour and diet were collected simultaneously (n = 15, Amélineau
