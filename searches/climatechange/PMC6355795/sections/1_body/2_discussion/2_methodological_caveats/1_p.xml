<p id="Par17" class="p">Overall, we detected strong environmental impacts on little auks, but our work entails methodological limitations. Indeed, organism answer to overall forcing is the integration of all environmental parameters, and disentangling the relative importance of each factor as well as their interactions requires advanced statistical methods that we could not apply due to temporal gaps in our datasets (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Consequently, as we used only one or two environmental independent variables at a time to explain one biological parameter with a hypothesis-based approach, the percentage of covariance explained by our significant relationships was low. It is therefore crucial to continue long-term monitoring programs to increase sample sizes. In addition, we possibly missed important additional environmental factors. For instance, we know that the timing of breeding in little auks is linked to the timing of snow melt in spring, which determines nest accessibility

 </sup>. Spring snow melt can be approximated by spring temperature, but we did not have access to this information at our study site. Also, other pollutants could, in addition to Hg, impact little auk reproduction and survival (e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>
 </sup>) but were not considered in the present study. Concerning survival data, we could not take oil spills into account

 </sup>, although it is known that little auks can be highly impacted during winter, with for instance an estimated 22,000 guillemots and little auks killed by hydrocarbon contamination in 2011–2012 off Newfoundland
