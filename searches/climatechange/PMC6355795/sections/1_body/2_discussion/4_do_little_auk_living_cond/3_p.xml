<p id="Par23" class="p">Regarding SSTs, previous studies suggested that the most profitable foraging areas for little auks are located in the cold waters encountered in the Sørkapp Current (SW Spitsbergen) and in the East Greenland Current that contain bigger

 </sup>. SSTs are higher in Western Spitsbergen than in East Greenland, and these contrasting findings suggest that little auk fitness could follow a quadratic relationship with SST, peaking at intermediate SST. An increase in SST could then be beneficial at low SSTs (East Greenland, mean SST of 0.67 °C) but detrimental at high SSTs (Spitsbergen, mean SST of 1.81 °C at Hornsund and 4.51 °C at Kongsfjorden). However, little auks did not seem impacted by observed changes in SST around Bjørnøya, where they foraged in warm waters (median SST of 6.6 °C) during the period 2005–2012
