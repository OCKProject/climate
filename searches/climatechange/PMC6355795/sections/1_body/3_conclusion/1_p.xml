<p id="Par27" class="p">Understanding how animals will cope with environmental changes is a topical challenge in ecology. Since the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world it can be seen as a natural laboratory to anticipate changes occurring at a more global scale. Unfortunately, logistical constraints, including year round access, limit fieldwork studies in this part of the world. In addition, biological responses are complex and integrate environmental constraints which may be logistically difficult to evaluate at remote locations. Our results highlight the importance of pursuing long term monitoring programs in the Arctic to improve dataset length and quality, and gain power to elaborate more complex models
