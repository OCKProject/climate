<p class="p">Based on this review, methodological guidelines specific to the economics of health and climate changes are needed to stimulate more economic research and provide standardization of approaches. More recently, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed detailed methods on how to assess impacts and adaptation costs, which hopefully will be helpful to further shape this agenda.
 <xref rid="b13-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> Further, more information and data are necessary on the health impacts of climate change, potential future developments, adaptation options, and the monetary requirements in the health sector and beyond. At the moment, the few studies available indicate simply that more resources need to be allocated in countries with the highest health impacts and with the least resilience to withstand climate change. Despite the evidence gaps, investing in health protection measures will pay economic dividends in terms of saved treatment costs, gained workforce productivity, as well as the very large social and welfare value associated with saved lives. Current approaches focus mainly on a near-term perspective with a lower risk “no regrets” policies, rather than a longer term perspective. A monitoring and surveillance system targeted to detect the health effects of climate change would help to identify emerging health risks so that timely action can be taken, as well as would generate data to be used in assessments and economic analysis.
