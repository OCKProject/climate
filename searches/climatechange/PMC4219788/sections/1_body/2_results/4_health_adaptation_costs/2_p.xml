The results are presented with future costs in present values using an annual discount rate of 5% and 0%. The underlying health models do not predict increase in malaria cases for this region. However, investments in several other sectors have important implications for health, such as the water sector and extreme events, and hence these are added to the health sector costs below to give “health-related” costs. Two alternative global circulation models are used to predict future disease cases: the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM)-3 model (termed the “wet” scenario) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-3 model (termed the “dry” scenario). Infrastructure investment (estimated as the cost of health education, water supply, and sewers) is estimated to cost between US$300 (€250) (CSIRO) and US$800 (€670) (NCAR) million annually. The adaptation cost for agriculture and fisheries (estimated as the cost to prevent climate change-attributed cases of malnutrition) is estimated at between US$470 (€390) (CSIRO) and US$1,320 (€1,100) (NCAR) million annually. Water storage and flood protection cost between US$300 million (€250) (CSIRO) and US$2,600 (€2,170) (NCAR) million annually. Preparing for extreme events – involving education and training schemes for target populations – is estimated to cost between US$500 (€415) (CSIRO) and US$1,000 (€830) (NCAR) million annually. The overall health-related costs for Europe and central Asia are estimated at between US$1.57 billion (€1.3 billion) (CSIRO) and US$5.72 billion (€4.8 billion) (NCAR).
