<p class="p">For waterborne diseases, rotavirus vaccination has been the subject of several economic evaluation studies across Europe. The cost per QALY gained ranges from €21,900 to €35,076 in Dutch children from 0 to 4 years old, using Rotarix™.
 <xref rid="b51-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref> In France, a routine universal rotavirus immunization program was estimated to cost €138,000 per QALY saved and avoid annually 89,000 cases of diarrhea, 10,500 hospitalizations, and 8 deaths.
 <xref rid="b52-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref> In Finland, the cost per QALY gained was €25,218 for Rotarix and €45,199 for RotaTeq, preventing annually 2,000 hospitalized cases and over 10,000 outpatient visits.
 <xref rid="b53-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref> The costs and benefits of improved provision of water supply and sanitation services were estimated by the WHO in WHO epidemiological strata B and C (mainly, non-EU and non-OECD countries) – finding that the economic benefits (including health and time savings) were worth 20 times the costs of these services
