<p class="p">Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases result from air pollution, which are exacerbated with higher temperatures. While the pathways of effects are indirect and complex, the purpose of this presentation is to explore studies that assess the damage costs of overall air pollution and the economics of various response measures. The economic literature on air quality-related disease burden includes a range of studies examining different interventions applied at different levels, from sector-specific studies to national studies to Europe-wide studies.

Few studies include other economic benefits, such as avoided damage to agriculture and ecosystems or avoided damage to infrastructure and public buildings from corrosive pollutants. Six studies identified including health impact measurement and presenting benefitâ€“cost ratios were as follows:
