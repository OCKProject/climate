<p class="p">Economic studies on end-use food preparation studies are fewer. One study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of a disinfection program that targets high-risk food preparation activities in household kitchens in the United States of America, Canada, and United Kingdom.
 <xref rid="b36-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref> The average cost–utility ratio in United Kingdom was £86,341 (€124,770) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A QALY is a positive measure of health, and is the equivalent of a year of life lived in full health. When targeting households with high-risk members (those less than 5 years of age, greater than 65 years of age, or immune compromised), the cost per QALY reduced to £28,158 (€40,700).
