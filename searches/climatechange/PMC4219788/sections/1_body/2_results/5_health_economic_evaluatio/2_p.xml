<p class="p">In the area of heat-health early warning systems, while many European countries have heat-health plans,
 <xref rid="b26-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> no studies were found from Europe that compare the costs and health impacts of such systems. A study from Philadelphia, United States of America, indicates the potential value for money of such systems. The Philadelphia heat-health early warning system, initiated in 1995, was considered unique at the time because of its coordination between different public and private agencies, including mass media campaigns and community mobilization. At a value of US$4 million (€5.4 million) per life saved, the gross benefits of the Philadelphia heat-health warning system were in the order of US$468 million (€626 million) over 4 years, or US$117 million (€157 million) per year. Additional non-valued benefit is from avoided morbidity. The annual marginal costs of the system were estimated at US$115,000 (€154,000), in addition to the costs of developing the system of US$60,000 (€80,000).

 <xref rid="b28-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref> Hence, the cost per life saved is very low at less than US$4,000 (€5,350), indicating an efficient use of public funds. However, these costs are only marginal costs, and do not consider the redeployment of resources already paid for by public authorities, such as salaries and vehicles.
