<p class="p">The study “Projection of economic impacts of climate change in sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up analysis” (PESETA) predicts almost 107,000 extra heat-related deaths per year in 2071–2100 for 27 EU Member States under a global mean temperature increase of 3.9 °C, compared to the baseline period 1961–1990.
 <xref rid="b4-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> In 2080, the value of excess deaths is estimated at €50 billion annually (when valuing each excess death) and €118 billion (when valuing the loss of a year of life). The greatest impact is in central southern Europe. These impacts are, however, likely to be balanced out by reduced cold-related deaths, with the greatest gains in northern Europe and the United Kingdom. For food-borne diseases, the PESETA study estimates that the average annual number of temperature-related cases of

Under climate scenario A2, these cases and costs are predicted to double for the period 2071–2100.
