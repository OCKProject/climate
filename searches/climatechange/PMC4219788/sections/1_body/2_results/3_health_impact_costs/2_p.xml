<p class="p">Bosello et al use the general equilibrium Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to estimate, among other impacts, the health-care costs of treating climate change-attributed cases and labor productivity impacts of six disease groups for each world region.
 <xref rid="b11-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref> For the European regions, the study included cardiovascular, respiratory, and diarrheal diseases for the year 2050. The paper does not report if it valued the future economic impacts in present values using discounting. The study predicts 176,000 net deaths avoided from higher temperatures, which are valued at a saving of €38 billion annually in the EU area, and 284,000 annual deaths avoided in former Soviet Union (FSU) countries valued at a saving of €4 billion. The significantly lower economic value in FSU countries for a higher number of deaths avoided is because the estimation of the value of life is based on GDP per capita, which is significantly lower in FSU countries. The net reductions in death in temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere are due to the avoidance of cold-related cardiovascular death exceeding the increase in heat-related deaths. However, there is no assessment of winners and losers, by demographic or geographical group within each of the eight world regions. Using a computable general equilibrium model to assess economy-wide impact of the global health effects, the study reports that the negative impact on GDP is greater than the sum of the costs associated with the three diseases because of their impacts on other economic activities.
