<p class="p">Valuation approaches vary between studies. For example, premature mortality is valued in terms of both a saved life and a saved life year. Valuing a saved life year usually leads to lower economic values than saved lives, especially for the elderly population. Furthermore, some studies only measure morbidity costs (mainly health-care costs) or some measure only mortality costs, while others include both morbidity and mortality costs. In general, when they are both included, mortality costs outweigh morbidity costs by several times. Given that mortality valuations are based on value of statistical life, and not actual financial transactions to reduce health risks, the major share of overall welfare gain from health protection measures is of a non-financial nature. Cost comparisons between studies are further impeded by the fact that the baseline year is often different, the years covered by the study are different, and some studies estimate future impacts in current values using discounting, while others do not. Good practice is to present results under different scenarios to show sensitivity of results to different assumptions or study scope and to support comparison.</p>
