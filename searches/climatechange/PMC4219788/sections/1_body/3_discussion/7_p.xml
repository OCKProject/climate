<p class="p">Fifth, the long-time horizons involved in climate change make it important to clarify what is the baseline scenario. For example, should the costs of future measures take into account future expected health sector developments that affect underlying disease vulnerability and hence adaptation responses? This point is particularly relevant for the lower income countries of Europe where there is a greater adaptation deficit. Whether future health investments are labeled as development investments or adaptation investments will affect the calculation of adaptation costs. Given that investments in climate change adaptation will increasingly become part and parcel of a country’s development process, especially for lower income countries, the “development baseline” approach adopted by the World Bank study, for example, will underestimate the actual costs of adapting to climate change.
