<p class="p">Fourth, the number of studies that assess the health effects of climate change is very few. While general relationships and trends are predicted with increasing confidence as models are refined and data quality improves (eg, on changes in temperature and precipitation), the health impact numbers are still not known. The only EU-wide health economic estimates are on selected temperature-related disease burdens â€“ on 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> and diarrheal disease cases. Given the variation in climate models and impact assessment frameworks used, combined with uncertainty in economic values, the resulting economic outcomes would have very wide confidence intervals or ranges if sensitivity analysis was conducted using alternative data inputs. However, this is rarely done in studies. This makes it extremely difficult to understand the range of likely economic impact or intervention efficiency, and thus reduces the strength of policy recommendation possible. Further, current available health vulnerability assessments have not been used to assess the economic costs.
