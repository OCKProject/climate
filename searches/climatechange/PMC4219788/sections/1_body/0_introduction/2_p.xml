In Europe, many actions are ongoing at country as well as at regional levels.
 <xref rid="b6-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> Between 2004 and 2014, 22 of 53 WHO European Region countries (or 15 of 28 European Union countries) adopted national adaptation plan (NAP) or strategies.

The main health actions planned include strengthening health systems, early warning systems, disaster preparedness, awareness-raising of citizens, and specific legislative changes for buildings and constructions to regulate heat in the internal environment. The European Commitment to Act of the Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health has further set direction on the action to take in the health sector and beyond to avert the adverse health effects of climate change.
