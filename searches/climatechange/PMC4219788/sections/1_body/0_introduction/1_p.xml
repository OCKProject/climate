In addition, health is indirectly impacted by many other factors that are themselves affected by climate change, such as water quality and quantity, ecosystems, food security, agriculture, transportation, energy production, and economic growth itself. Also in Europe, some health gains from climate change are anticipated, such as reduced winter cold-related deaths, and positive health and economic benefits of increased crop productivity in some geographical areas.

These countries vary enormously in relation to geography, climate, sociocultural environment, health system development, population health status, and economic level. Hence, their vulnerability and capacity to respond to the health threats of climate change are widely divergent.
