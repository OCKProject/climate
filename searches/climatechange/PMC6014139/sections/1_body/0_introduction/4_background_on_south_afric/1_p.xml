<p class="p">South Africa has an area of about 1 221 000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and is located in the southernmost part of the African continent (DEA 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011c</xref>:2). The country has nine provinces. In 2015, South Africa had an estimated population of about 54.96 million people (Stats SA 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The country has, on average, a semi-arid and warm climate; the prevalent aridity makes the country prone to limitations in water supply (DEA 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011b</xref>:ix). South Africa is vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, including impacts of increasing temperature and changes in rainfall patterns (both increases in the intensity of rainfall as well as the frequency of droughts) (DEA 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011b</xref>:7). Moreover, the relatively high poverty levels compound the vulnerability. The DEA (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011c</xref>:x) notes that ‘at least 30% of South Africa’s population is highly vulnerable to both sudden and harmful climatic shocks, with low levels of endogenous resilience, adaptation, and coping skills’.
