<p class="p">Climate variability and change are having marked impacts on some communities, with models predicting an increase in the intensity and severity of impacts as well as an increase in the number of people and communities being negatively affected (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>:757). There is a need to respond to this challenge. As noted, climate change requires urgent action as the costs of early action will be far less than the costs of delay and inaction (Department of Environmental Affairs [DEA] 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>:10). Dealing with this challenge requires rapid anticipatory responses that empower and enable individuals, communities and decision makers to better adapt to the risks associated with climate change. Adaptation is a process, action or outcome in a system (household, community, group, sector, region or country) that helps the system to better cope with, manage or adjust to some changing condition, stress, hazard, risk or opportunity (Smit &amp; Wandel 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:282). The goals of adaptation are to moderate the adverse effects of climate change through a wide range of actions targeted at moderating harmful effects while exploiting new opportunities brought about by climate change (FÃ¼ssel &amp; Klein 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:304; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:6).
