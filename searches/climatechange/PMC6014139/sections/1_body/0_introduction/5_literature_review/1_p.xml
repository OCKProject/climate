<p class="p">Climate change requires reflection on successes and failures, and integration of knowledge from several disciplines and sectors (Orderud &amp; Winsvold 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:956; Shaw &amp; Kristjanson 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:22). In this context, dynamic learning is more appropriate than conventional blueprint planning in climate change adaptation (Sterman 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:292). Enhancing the flow of information and development of knowledge and awareness on adaptation is important (FÃ¼ssel &amp; Klein 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:321). This requires ongoing, adaptive knowledge creation that is scaled up from individuals though social interactions (McCarthy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). This is social learning, viewed by Steyaert et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:540) as an iterative process of knowledge co-production among interacting stakeholders, resulting in relational and cognitive changes and improved capacities and competencies of actors (Muro &amp; Jeffrey 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Thus, social learning is central to climate change adaptation (Collins &amp; Ison 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:370) by inspiring collective action (Nisbet et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>:329). Multiple stakeholders with different values, beliefs and cultures participate in decision making and action (Blackmore 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:514). This participation results in the understanding of issues going beyond the individual to become situated within wider social units or communities (Reed et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>).
