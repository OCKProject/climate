<p class="p">A social learning perspective is, however, no panacea to climate change adaptation. Pahl-Wostl (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) points out that its meaning is very broad, whereas Harvey et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:12) lament the lack of clarity over definitions and framings of social learning. Some scholars (e.g. Reed et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Rodela, Cundill &amp; Wals 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:16) have commented that some definitions are so broad they could encompass almost any social process, with the same term often being used to refer to different processes (Lotz-Sisitka 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>:11). Moreover, it is not always clear how the social learning theory translates to practice (Allan &amp; Wilson 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:389) and what the obstacles to social learning are. Impediments to learning may reside in personal cognitive factors which may affect the motivation and capacity of individuals (Mathevet et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sterman 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:307) or in organisational factors that may frustrate individuals and stifle learning (Stirzaker, Roux &amp; Biggs 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>:4). Social learning is promoted when learning individuals and learning organisations come together. It is therefore important to understand whether efforts to promote social learning should be focused at the organisational level, the individual level, or both.
