<p class="p">Adaptation is increasingly becoming an important part of policy discussions on climate change; the body of scholarship and the applied work are expanding (Plummer &amp; Baird 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>:635). In addition, social learning is progressively acknowledged as important in enhancing the adaptive capacity (e.g. Allan &amp; Wilson 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:389; Pelling &amp; High 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>:1). Yet few of these documents and processes explain how adaptive capacity will be enhanced through learning, reflection and innovation. Analysts further do not distinguish between personal factors, at the level of the individual, and organisational factors. The objectives of this study were, firstly, to seek evidence of personal factors, and organisational factors, that promote social learning in climate change adaptation initiatives in South Africa and, secondly, to identify the personal and organisational enablers and obstacles to social learning in these initiatives.
