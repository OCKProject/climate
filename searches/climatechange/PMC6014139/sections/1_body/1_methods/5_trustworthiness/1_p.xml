<p class="p">Steps were taken to ensure reliability and validity in the study. In order to ensure reliability of the collected data, the online questionnaire was evaluated by other experts in the field on whether it measured the right parameters. It was also pilot tested to ensure that it was simple to complete, that the questions were well structured and the coding was proper. The Cronbach’s alpha (Muro &amp; Jeffrey 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) was used to test the reliability of the parameters used to evaluate social learning in the study. The Cronbach’s alpha seeks to measure the extent to which the scale measures one underlying construct (Field 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:675); in this case, the construct being measured is ‘social learning’. The scale variables had a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.808. Pallant (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) noted that coefficient values above 0.7 are considered acceptable; however, values above 0.8 are preferable. While the sample might appear small, it is important to stress that at the time of the data collection, there were relatively few people working on climate change issues, which might have implications on the generalisation of the results. As pointed out before, the survey was sent out to 279 individuals, of which 38 (14%) completed the survey. The majority of the 38 respondents had significant work experience on climate change issues. About 45% of them had more than 5 years of working experience. About 25% worked for the government (i.e. national, provincial and local), 37% in NGOs, 11% in private organisations, and 29% in research organisations.
