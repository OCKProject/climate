<p class="p">Inadequate funding was highlighted as a serious constraint. This was exacerbated by short project timeframes and delays in the allocation of resources. Other scholars, for example, Roux et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>:4), noted that departments or agencies are sometimes informed about their budget allocations only halfway through the financial year, making it difficult to mobilise and spend resources, presenting challenges to planning and implementing project activities on time. When requirements and guidelines are rigid, coupled with delays in budget and resource allocation, activities to facilitate social learning become superficial and tokenistic. This situation calls for flexibility in project budgets and timeframes.
