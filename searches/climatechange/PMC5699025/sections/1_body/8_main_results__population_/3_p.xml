<p class="p">Each of these results is an optimal mitigation policy path under DICE, meaning that mitigation effort maximizes intertemporal discounted wellbeing, according to the chosen social objective. Below, we also discuss results for the same population scenarios but constrained by temperature targets. Unless otherwise noted, all model runs assume a 1.5% annual rate of time preference and a 1.45 inequality aversion parameter (representing the diminishing marginal utility of consumption), the values chosen for DICE2013 by William Nordhaus, the architect of the model.
