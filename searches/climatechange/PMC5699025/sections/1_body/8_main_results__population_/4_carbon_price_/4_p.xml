<p class="p">To help explain the mechanism of this result, consider a hypothetical case of constant exponential population growth. Under TU, the rate of population growth would be linearly added to or subtracted from the rate of pure exponential time discounting to determine the weight put on average wellbeing of future time periods: The weighting roles of time preference and population growth are analogous (ref.

 </xref>). Because the difference in population growth to 2200 between the UN-high and -low scenarios is comparable to a 1.4 percentage point constant difference in population growth, we show in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d35e372" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6
 </xref> that the difference in optimal policy under TU between these population trajectories is similar to changing the rate of pure time preference from 0.1% to 1.5%. A rate of time preference ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% bounds the values for time preference common in the climate economics and policy literature (

 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Therefore, under TU, the importance of population assumptions for optimal carbon policy is quantitatively comparable to the assumptions frequently debated about time preference. Under AU, the rate of population growth has no weighting effect.
