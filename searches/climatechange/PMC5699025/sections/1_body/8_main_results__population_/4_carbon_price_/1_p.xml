The results demonstrate that future population has a large effect on optimal policy, with carbon prices over 85% higher in 2025 and 120% higher in 2050, assuming the UN-high compared with the UN-low population scenario given the TU objective. Relatedly, full abatement (100% decarbonization)—the point in

 </xref> where each carbon price path peaks and subsequently declines along a single line (representing an assumed “backstop price” at which zero carbon technologies are competitive with all fossil fuels)—occurs more than half a century later under the UN-low vs. UN-high scenario. Carbon prices in the Ultralow scenario stay far lower still, and full abatement is never optimal given the TU objective. A regionally disaggregated comparison of the UN-medium with the UN-low scenario—as well as an alternative comparison of an SSP-inspired population scenario—shows that the differences in the SCC across alternative population projections are principally driven by differences in the future population paths of developing countries, with sub-Saharan Africa the greatest contributor (
