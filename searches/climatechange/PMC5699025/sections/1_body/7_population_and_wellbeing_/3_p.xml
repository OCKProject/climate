<p class="p">Although not currently applied in CEMs, other non-TU social objectives are common in the population literature and could be used instead (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). As a central example, an average utilitarian (AU) social objective focuses on per capita wellbeing and ignores population size, unless population size influences average wellbeing. The average utilitarian concept has had multiple implementations in the literature. The AU SWF that this paper uses provides a clear contrast with TU and integrates straightforwardly with the discrete-time structure of DICE and other CEMs: It calculates levels of wellbeing from average consumption in each time period and then maximizes the sum of those multiplied by the discount factor, but not by the population. However, other implementations exist: Asheim (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>), studying the value of population in the genuine savings criterion, uses a similar AU as we do, while Arrow et al. (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>) instead use an implementation which Dasgupta (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>) calls “dynamic average utilitarianism” and which divides the discounted sum of total utility across time by the discounted sum of total population across time. TU and AU each have theoretical advantages and disadvantages which have been explored in the population ethics literature (
