<p class="p">In leading CEMs, population size is an exogenous variable calibrated to a population projection at the time of the model parameterization (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). Although it is clear that updated population projections are one source of variation in results estimated by different model versions (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), systematic testing of alternative projections has not been standard in major assessments (although see refs. 
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref> and more recently ref. 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>); even less research has focused on analyzing the importance of assumptions about how population is valued by society and what that means for climate policy. In stark contrast, there has been comprehensive treatment of the ethical parameters that determine the discount rate referred to above—the inequality aversion parameter and the rate of time preference—with the choice of these parameters becoming one of the most prominent debates in climate economics (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). The lack of attention to the social valuation of population growth is particularly surprising because population size, unlike the discounting parameters, is modifiable by policy intervention.
