It is important to differentiate CEMs from other types of “integrated assessment models.” Here CEMs refer specifically to cost–benefit models that evaluate the impact on wellbeing of climate change and associated policy decisions and are the basis of estimates of the SCC. They are distinct from other types of integrated assessment models in that they quantify the economic damage from increased temperatures, alongside descriptions of the economy and emission processes (
