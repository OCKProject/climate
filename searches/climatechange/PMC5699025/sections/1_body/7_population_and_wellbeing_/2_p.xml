<p class="p">The key tradeoff in these models is between mitigation and climate damages, where mitigation expenditures disproportionately subtract from the wellbeing of people now, while damages disproportionately subtract from the wellbeing of people in the more distant future. The tradeoff is made in a way that maximizes the objective of the model, called a “social welfare function” (SWF). All leading optimization CEMs share a total utilitarian (TU) SWF, according to which the (social) objective is to maximize the sum of (discounted) wellbeing across time (

Globally aggregated CEMs such as DICE calculate the wellbeing of the average individual for each point in time as the average consumption transformed into wellbeing by a utility function which embodies “inequality aversion.” The TU objective is the sum of the total wellbeing at each time point (average wellbeing multiplied by the population size), with each time point discounted to a present value at a chosen rate of “time preference.”
