<p class="p">The structure of this paper is as follows. In the Introduction we introduce two population-sensitive approaches for valuing human wellbeing (these approaches are known as “social objectives”) and explain the treatment of population in cost–benefit climate–economy models (CEMs). In

 </xref>, we use a range of recent population projections, together with the DICE model, to show that population growth has a large effect on climate policy and the SCC. This is true, although quantitatively different, using either of the two most common approaches for comparing social wellbeing across populations of different size, known as total utilitarianism and average utilitarianism (described below). We then extend our analysis by quantifying what these differences imply in terms of mitigation expenditures, observing that smaller-population futures imply lower mitigation costs under either ethical approach, but on different timescales and with different conclusions about the overall desirability of different population pathways.
