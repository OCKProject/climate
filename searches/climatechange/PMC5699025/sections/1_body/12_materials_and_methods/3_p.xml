<p class="p">Like all leading CEMs, the size of the population is an exogenous variable in DICE. In this study, we compute optimal carbon prices and thus mitigation paths by exogenously specifying a variety of population trajectories, based primarily on the 2015 revision of the UNâ€™s World Population Prospects and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway project (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Both of these sources provide a range of population estimates through 2100. To project beyond 2100 we assume that the population growth rate in the timestep ending in 2100 tapers linearly to zero between 2100 and 2195 and remains constant thereafter. The Ultralow projection continues past 2100.
