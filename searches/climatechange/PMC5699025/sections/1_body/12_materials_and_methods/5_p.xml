<p class="p">In a small subset of our modeling runs, we also make an additional change to DICE to investigate our research questions. To generate one result reported in the main text, we change the rate of time preference to the value that would make the optimal mitigation trajectory of the UN-low population scenario provide the closest fit to that of the UN-high scenario (
