<p class="p">Other than the changes to population that are essential to our experiments, the DICE2013 model is unchanged (including default parameter values, such as a climate sensitivity of 3.2) with one exception: We specify an exogenous savings rate of 25.8%, which can be interpreted as the optimal savings rate of private savers with a time-separable and discounted objective with a logarithmic utility function (

 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). To explain this approach, we first note that there are two alternative treatments of savings in the climateâ€“economy modeling literature: One approach assumes that economic agents endogenously look forward to climate damages and policies and optimally adjust their planned savings (a leading example is in the official versions of DICE/Regional Integrated Climate Economy (RICE)), and another assumes that savings do not so respond to climate policy optimization (leading examples are FUND and PAGE; in a DICE/RICE framework, see ref. 
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Although both approaches are defensible, we prefer and use the second approach, because we find it more realistic to assume that society has a fixed appetite for savings that is essentially insensitive to climate change and climate policy decisions. In

 </xref>, we demonstrate that our results are substantively identical and quantitatively very similar if we instead endogenize optimal savings as in DICE.
