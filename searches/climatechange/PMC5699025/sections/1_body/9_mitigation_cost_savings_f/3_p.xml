<p class="p">To compute mitigation cost savings, we depart from the previous section, which presented optimal mitigation trajectories without any constraint on the level of temperature increase, by here estimating the mitigation costs (and savings) needed to achieve targets of 2 °C and 3 °C under both population scenarios. This allows us to compare costs when the level of temperature rise is held constant, including at the 2 °C target that is often considered necessary to prevent dangerous climate change. (Note that a target of 2 °C and 3 °C requires greater than optimal mitigation effort in DICE—see
