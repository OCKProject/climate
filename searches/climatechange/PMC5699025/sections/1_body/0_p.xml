<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">The size of the human population, in the near-term and distant future, is a key determinant of climate policy: All else equal, a larger population entails more emissions and therefore more mitigation to achieve a given climate target (

The extensive time lag between the environmental pressure (emissions) and the impacts (fully realized climate damages) differentiates the climate problem from other issues at the human population and environment nexus, as the costs of mitigation will be borne largely by people now, but most of the benefits will be experienced by a future stream of people which is uncertain in size.
