  <p class="p">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety problem that may develop in some people after exposure to extremely traumatic events, such as climate hazards/disasters. Kim et al. (
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2013</xref>) review 16 publications and find that mind–body practices (including mindfulness-based practices) are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms.

  <p class="p">Such concepts relate either directly to mindfulness or indirectly, in terms of compassion. Scholars define compassion in organisations as a threefold relational process of: collectively noticing that another is suffering, empathising with their pain, and responding.</p>

  <p class="p">Brown and Ryan (
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2003</xref>) consider mindlessness as the relative absence of mindfulness, which, in simple terms, is found when individuals behave compulsively or automatically, without awareness of or attention to their behaviour (Deci and Ryan 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">1980</xref>).

  <p class="p">‘Private adaptation’ refers to initiatives taken by individuals or private households, rather than authorities or governments, and corresponds to ‘autonomous adaptation’. Both private/individual and public adaptation can be a conscious or unconscious response to actual or expected climate change, including variability and extremes (IPCC
