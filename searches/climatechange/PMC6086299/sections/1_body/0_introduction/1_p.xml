<p class="p">Climate change is creating increasingly complex sustainability challenges that require new pathways and innovation (Kates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2001</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). Climate variability, climate hazards, and disasters are a manifestation of a systemic world, characterized by multiple causations, interactions, complex feedback loops, and inevitable uncertainty and unpredictability (Lang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2012</xref>; IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, current coordination mechanisms and problem-solving strategies appear insufficient to address these issues (Dhiman and Marques 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2016</xref>; Kunze 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2012</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). At the same time, the potential influence of human beings’ ‘interiority’ for impeding or supporting climate adaptation is increasingly recognised (O’Brian and Hochachka 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" class="xref">2011</xref>; Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">2008</xref>; Wamsler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" class="xref">2017</xref>). New solutions need to be found.
