<p class="p">Based on a literature review (described in “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methodology</xref>”), this paper assesses current research on mindful climate adaptation and how individual mindfulness may be linked to climate adaptation (see “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Results</xref>”). From this, the core conceptual trajectories of the mindfulness–adaptation nexus are outlined, constituting the first comprehensive framework for—what is called here—‘mindful climate adaptation’ (see “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Discussion and conclusions</xref>”).
