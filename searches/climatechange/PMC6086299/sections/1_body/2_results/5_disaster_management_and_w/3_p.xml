<p class="p">In fact, disaster management research that addresses the mindfulness–adaptation nexus has vastly overlooked issues of risk perception and risk communication, and how they translate into action-taking (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Only studies can be found that focus on certain attributes of mindfulness, such as emotions and compassion (e.g., Roeser

Positive emotions and compassion-based climate change communication have also been found to be more effective than ‘motivation by fear’ in the context of extreme weather and other climate phenomena (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole
