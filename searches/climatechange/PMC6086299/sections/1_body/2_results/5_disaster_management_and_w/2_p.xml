<p class="p">While these capacities are clearly crucial in all phases and contexts of climate adaptation (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), there are almost no studies of the interface between well-being and disaster management that address the issues of: (1) climate change; (2) mindfulness disposition; and (3) proactive adaptation, including response and recovery preparedness (Ryan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145" class="xref">2016</xref>; Wamsler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" class="xref">2017</xref>).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4" class="xref">4</xref> The above-mentioned survey by Wamsler and Brink (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>) fills this gap by exploring how individual mindfulness is linked to climate adaptation. It complements the existing literature by showing that mindfulness disposition (as opposed to mindfulness interventions) might have positive impacts on response, recovery, and proactive climate adaptation. More specifically, a high mindfulness score was found to be positively correlated with a high score for overall motivation for climate adaptation, including both pro- and reactive actions (Wamsler and Brink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>). In addition, while the number of adaptation actions taken was not correlated to individual mindfulness, a positive correlation was found between mindfulness disposition and one adaptation action, namely warning neighbours about a storm (Wamsler and Brink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>). This aspect relates to another gap identified in the literature.
