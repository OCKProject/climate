It seeks to understand ways to expand the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world and, ultimately, support more sustainable behaviour. Accordingly, it is interested in the knowledge provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have a history of embracing nature, and its scholars argue that mindful awareness of our interdependence with nature not only helps us to regain our lost, ecologically embedded identity, but also helps us to behave more sustainably (Amel et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" class="xref">1995</xref>). This understanding is supported by an expanding body of scholarly evidence, suggesting that mindfulness is associated with environmentally responsible behaviour. It also led to the notion of ‘ecological mindfulness’, which was put forward in 2015 (Mueller and Greenwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). The survey by Wamsler and Brink (
