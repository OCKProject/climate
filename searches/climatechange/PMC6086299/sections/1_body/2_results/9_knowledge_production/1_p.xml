<p class="p">Finally, there is one other emerging body of research that addresses the mindfulness–adaptation nexus, namely knowledge production. This can be seen as a reaction to the increasing recognition of a disconnect between human experience and scientific activity that does not capture a holistic picture of climate adaptation, risk reduction, and resilience for instance (Bai

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2014</xref>). Science has always been shaped by contemporary problems, and it evolves with them. Until now, science research has been dominated by reductionism, as the intellectual and social model (Bai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, successful, it has been in the past, emerging policy issues and research into neuroplasticity, emotions and mindfulness seem to suggest that this ideal of rationality is no longer appropriate (cf. Schwartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wamsler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" class="xref">2017</xref>). Accordingly, risk and climate scholars are increasingly calling for research that incorporates local knowledge, i.e., ways of being, thinking, and knowing that are informed by centuries of lived experience and culture, and an approach that involves deep listening and joint internal reflection through external engagement (Gibson and Wisner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2016</xref>; Knodel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2014</xref>). This understanding is consistent with ecopsychology, animism, ecological mindfulness (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), and associated interdisciplinary and cross-hybrid learning (Chinn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>; Mueller and Greenwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). The latter states that knowledge production requires spaces where different perspectives can take root, be nurtured, and flourish into ways of knowing, being, and becoming that serve people, places, and the planet (Greenwood

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sameshima and Greenwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146" class="xref">2015</xref>). It requires more expansive and inclusive approaches where researchers are free to take risks—risks that cannot be taken when academic fiefdoms determine the questions that are asked and regulate methodologies, rather than encourage new thinking and creativity (Mueller and Greenwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">2015</xref>). Such an understanding also resonates with recent feminist and cultural geography literature that speaks of emotion as an element in choosing research questions, and a driver of how research is conducted (Davidson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2012</xref>; Sharp 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156" class="xref">2009</xref>).
