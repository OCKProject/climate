<p class="p">This links to another area of organisational research relevant for exploring the mindfulness–adaptation nexus, namely leadership. In addition to the qualities that are traditionally associated with good leadership (vision, authority, etc.), mindfulness and associated emotional intelligence are increasingly seen as crucial (Goleman

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2011</xref>). Studies have looked at the role of mindfulness (and mindlessness

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177" class="xref">2003</xref>). This is especially crucial in a context of climate change, where poor leadership has been shown to maximize hazard impacts, seen in the example of the Katrina–Rita hurricanes in New Orleans (Paté-Cornell and Cox 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kapuco and Van Wart 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2008</xref>), and where mindlessness has been associated with maladaptation, both in psychological and physical terms (Langer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">1989</xref>). The survey results of Wamsler and Brink (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>) support the outcomes of this literature review in that they show that a high mindfulness score was found to be positively correlated with a high score for overall motivation to support or engage in adaptation. No further outcomes could be derived regarding organisational management, since the survey focused on at-risk-citizens, and not on climate professionals and/or organisations (Wamsler and Brink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>).
