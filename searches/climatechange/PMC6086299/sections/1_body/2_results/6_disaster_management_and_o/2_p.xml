 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188" class="xref">1999</xref>). Organisational mindfulness is said to support collective and organisational learning with respect to the anticipation of, and coping with, unexpected events (Becke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>; Becke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>), and to actively nurture the key social resources that underlie performance and sustainability when facing climate events with potentially long-lasting consequences (Becke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>). It is based on the stated positive influence of mindfulness on overall well-being, understanding complexity, sensitivity to context and multiple perspectives, as well as cognitive flexibility and openness to novelty that, in turn, encourage organisations to constantly probe their environment for ways to stay ahead through innovation (Brown and Eisenhardt

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188" class="xref">1999</xref>). In contrast, the notions of ‘compassion organising’ and ‘corporate philanthropic disaster response’ focus on how organisations relate to employees who have been affected by natural hazards (Simpson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162" class="xref">2015</xref>; Watkins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185" class="xref">2015</xref>; Thomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171" class="xref">2015</xref>). Given the mounting evidence regarding differential vulnerability and the different impacts of hazards and associated responses, such approaches are becoming increasingly relevant for both organisational reliability and social equity (Hochwarter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lilly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">2008</xref>).
