<p class="p">The complementary survey by Wamsler and Brink (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>) adds to this literature review in that it shows linkages between mindfulness and ‘other-focused’ social factors. More specifically, it showed a positive correlation between individual mindfulness and being motivated by social factors (i.e., encouraged by friends and family, reducing the risk for others, and having a ‘good conscience’), while economic and ecological motivation could not be linked to mindfulness (Wamsler and Brink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>). This outcome can be linked with social equity and justice. In addition, while the number of adaptation actions taken was not correlated to mindfulness disposition, a positive correlation was found between mindfulness disposition and one ‘other-focused’ adaptation action, namely warning neighbours about a storm (Wamsler and Brink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>).
