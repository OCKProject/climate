<p class="p">Research into the interface between mindfulness and social justice in a context of climate change remains rare. However, it is becoming the focus of current mindfulness debates (Davis and Kabat-Zinn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2015</xref>) and a range of new concepts, such as political mindfulness (Rowe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144" class="xref">2017</xref>; Senghaas-Knowbloch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153" class="xref">2014</xref>), sacred activism (Pio and Syed 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">2014</xref>), mindful engagement (Wood and Mazur 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192" class="xref">2016</xref>), mindful social change
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8" class="xref">8</xref>, and associated studies of moral awareness and judgement (Markowitz and Shariff 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">2012</xref>; Senghaas-Knowbloch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152" class="xref">2012</xref>) are emerging. ‘Political mindfulness’ is closely related to organisational mindfulness (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), but with a focus on the broader political community that sets the norms and rules for societal development, e.g., inter- and transnational organisations such as the World Bank (Senghaas-Knowbloch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152" class="xref">2012</xref>). In contrast, sacred activism takes a bottom–up approach. A sacred activist can be described as someone who intentionally works towards social change, by providing compassionate services for others in the face of growing injustice, suffering, and violence, based on the perception that the world is experiencing a profound crisis and everyone needs to act (Harvey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2009</xref>; Pio and Syed 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">2014</xref>). Sacred activism is also closely linked to organisational research, as it is understood to be intertwined into a practical and pragmatic drive to transform institutions (Pio and Syed 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">2014</xref>). Similarly, ‘mindful engagement’ and ‘mindful social change’ concepts are emerging. Mindful engagement looks at collective social and environmental responsibility, based on the humanitarian principle of ‘do no harm’ (Anderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1999</xref>; IFRC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wood and Mazur 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192" class="xref">2016</xref>). Mindful social change aims to explore the connection between mindfulness and transformative social change (Gonzáles 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, here again, scholarly research is scarce and almost non-existent in relation to climate adaptation.
