<p class="p">Finally, in terms of the four dimensions that are identified, mindful climate adaptation also implies: (1) the critical consideration of their interdependence (e.g., individual and planetary well-being and adaptation), and (2) a detailed evaluation of potential drawbacks (Doran

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179" class="xref">2016</xref>). While this study did not find any structural critiques of mindfulness for climate adaptation, potential side-effects (Howard

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189" class="xref">2011</xref>; Purser and Loy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">2013</xref>), and the potential co-optation of mindfulness for capitalist purposes (Carrette and King 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2005</xref>) have to be considered. In addition, further research is needed to critically look into context and pre- or co-conditions that can support individual mindfulness to bring about societal transformation. This sudy concludes that mindfulness has the potential to foster climate adaptation at multiple levels, from individual to global, and calls for further critical research into how we can tap into this potential to drive global change.
