<p class="p">The increasing numbers of disasters and climate change mean that humanity is facing ever more complex challenges (Kates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2001</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, the current approaches appear insufficient to address them (Kunze 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2012</xref>; Sol and Wals 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" class="xref">2015</xref>). New narratives and social practices are called for that encourage a broader, cultural shift towards sustainability (Dhiman and Marques

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2006</xref>; Wamsler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" class="xref">2017</xref>). This study shows that mindfulness has the potential to support such a shift. While current knowledge on mindfulness in climate adaptation remains scarce and fragmented (cf. Tables

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), it is gaining increasing momentum. Nearly all the relevant literature has been published in the past 5–10 years.
