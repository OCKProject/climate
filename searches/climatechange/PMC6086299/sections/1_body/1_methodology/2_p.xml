<p class="p">In parallel to this study, a quantitative survey was conducted that aimed to complement the literature review by empirically exploring how individual mindfulness is linked to climate adaptation. The survey study is presented in depth in Wamsler and Brink (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" class="xref">2018</xref>). It took the form of a written questionnaire sent to 600 households in the coastal municipality of Lomma, in the Scania region of Sweden. This area was selected as it is expected to be one of the Swedish regions hardest hit by climate change (Hall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2015</xref>; SCCV 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148" class="xref">2007</xref>). Households at risk from current and future climate change were identified based on municipal flood scenarios. The response rate was 36% (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2006</xref>). The FFMQ is a 39-item standardised instrument based on a 5-point Likert scale that measures mindfulness across five dimensions: observing, non-reacting, non-judging, acting with awareness, and describing. The selected questions had been tested and adapted to Swedish audiences (FFMQ_SWE; Lilja 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">2009</xref>). Attitudes to climate adaptation were assessed by self-ratings and actual actions. For the former, respondents were asked to rate, on a 5-point Likert scale, how motivating they found nine different circumstances. For the latter, a quantitative measure of the level/diversity of actual activity was created from a checklist of 14 common household adaptation actions (Wamsler and Brink

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182" class="xref">b</xref>), and a free-text option. SPSS software was used to analyse the data, and calculate correlations (Spearman’s rho) between mindfulness and the other variables. For more details, see Wamsler and Brink (
