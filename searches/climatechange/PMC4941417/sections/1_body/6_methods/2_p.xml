<p class="p">We ran all simulations in R version 3.12 (R Core Team, 2014) with starting values of N
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 0 and N
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = 25000. To capture the effects of hydroperiod stochasticity on population dynamics, we iterated our model 1000 times and based our conclusions on the average of these iterations. Each iteration ran over a time-series of 1100 inundations and hydroperiod (j) sequences were simulated to approximate those found in nature (
