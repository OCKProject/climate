<p class="p">Finally, to assess the effect of changes in life-history parameters on long-term stochastic population growth rates, we performed sensitivity and elasticity analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary methods S3</xref>). The sensitivity analysis quantified the change in population growth rates by sequentially adjusting each life-history parameter by suitably small increments. However, such a sensitivity analysis is often difficult to interpret when the life-history parameters are in differently scaled units (e.g. proportional survival rates compared to maturation time in days). The elasticity analysis, therefore, represents the effects of incremental changes in life-history parameters on population growth rates while simultaneously accounting for the variable scaling of these parameters.
