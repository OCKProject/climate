<p class="p">We differentiated between the egg survival (e) and hatching (h) rates of N

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (e
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and h
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, respectively). For N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, daily fecundity (f) was averaged per breeding pair since the fairy shrimps only reproduce sexually. Therefore, N
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> for any given inundation was the sum of the total fecundity on each day, considering that only a proportion of adults (a) survived to the next day. If the active population could not reach sexual maturity (m &gt; j), population dynamics were modelled as (2):
