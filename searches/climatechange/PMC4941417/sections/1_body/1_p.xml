<p class="p">Temporary pool zooplankton species are typically ‘r-selected’ with rapid maturation and high fecundity at a potential cost of life span
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Most populations rely on the production of dormant eggs to endure dry phases. These are added to an egg bank in the sediment from which a new active population hatches during a next inundation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Egg banks may be characterised by partial hatching, which ensures that offspring is spread over several inundations and could be part of a bet hedging strategy that buffers populations against occasional reproductive catastrophes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Theoretically, the hatching fraction of eggs is an important determinant of long term population fitness, especially under climate change

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. However, its significance can only be interpreted in the context of other life-history traits, such as maturation time, fecundity and both egg- and adult survival.
