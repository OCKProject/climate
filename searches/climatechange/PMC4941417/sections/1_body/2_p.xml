<p class="p">In this study, we set out to quantify the sensitivity of zooplankton populations from temporary pools to changes in hydroperiod to obtain improved estimates of their vulnerability to climate change. For this, we construct a matrix population model to simulate population growth rates of the fairy shrimp model species 
 <italic class="italic">Branchipodopsis wolfi</italic> (Crustacea, Branchiopoda, Anostraca) from rain fed rock pool habitats in South Africa. In addition, we examine the relative effect of changes in different life-history traits on population growth and extinction risk to identify those traits that are most likely to be under selection and that are key to the adaptive capacity of the species.
