<p class="p">Our simulations suggest variable contributions of different life-history traits to population growth along the pond permanence gradient. While sensitivity and elasticity analysis showed that the survival rate of new eggs increases in importance in long-lived pools, the positive effect of survival of older eggs from the egg bank increases as hydroperiods decrease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S3). This implies that the egg bank plays a more prominent role for population persistence in short-lived compared to long-lived pools, matching theoretical predictions
