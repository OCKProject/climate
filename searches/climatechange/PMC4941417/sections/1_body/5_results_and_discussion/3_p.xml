<p class="p">However, the results from our study suggest that small changes in life-history traits at least partly compensate for the increased extinction probability under reduced median hydroperiods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). Increasing trait values for adult or egg survival, fecundity and hatching fraction generally lowered the probability of population extinction for a given median hydroperiod. The only exception was age at sexual maturation, for which a one day increase in maturation time ensured that the egg bank was depleted and the population always went extinct in pools with a median hydroperiod shorter than 15 days. Changes in adult survival had the largest impact. Even an increase in daily adult survival rate by just 1% lowered the extinction probability by ±40–80%. Consistent with this result, our elasticity analysis suggested a strong effect of changes in adult survival on long term population growth, especially in long lived pools (

It must be noted that while we explored the impact of changes in life history traits on population growth and extinction probability, we did not distinguish between different processes that could lead to such changes. For instance, changes in life history trait values could directly result from exposure to increased temperatures under climate change or be brought about through phenotypic plasticity or (epi-)genetic change
