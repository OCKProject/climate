<p class="p">The current model only assesses indirect effects of temperature change on population growth and persistence (i.e. temperature change as a driver of variation in hydroperiod), but not direct effects on life history traits. It is likely that climate change in southern Africa will alter seasonal rainfall patterns, resulting in completely novel combinations of temperature and precipitation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. As such, it is difficult to predict how temperature will be correlated to hydroperiod. However, it is possible to speculate that changing temperature will affect life history traits in ways that would be tractable in our model. For instance, maturation rates could increase with temperature. Nonetheless, making quantitative links between temperature and life history traits requires further experiments to identify temperature response curves and physiological thresholds. Therefore, we chose to simply modify the life history traits directly without explicitly considering a potential temperature-dependency.
