<p class="p">Overall, we can conclude that the vulnerability of temporary pool zooplankton to climate change should be assessed using an integrated approach that transcends simple measures of exposure and incorporates studies of species sensitivity and adaptive capacity. For instance, the sensitivity of population growth rate to adult survival highlights the importance of experiments that include competitive and predatory interactions. Therefore, experimental evolution trials under realistic conditions should be the next step towards confirming the patterns and predictions revealed by our simple model.</p>
