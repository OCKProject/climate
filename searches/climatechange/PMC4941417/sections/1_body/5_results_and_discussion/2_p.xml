<p class="p">Simulations indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">B. wolfi</italic> can only maintain populations in temporary pools with a minimum median hydroperiod of 12 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). The extinction probability increased from ±0.6% to ±100% when the median hydroperiod decreased from 13 to 11 days in our simulations. These non-linear dynamics of extinction risk are worrying because global warming will likely reduce the average and median hydroperiod of the studied habitats by as much as 15% and 29–41%, respectively (K. Tuytens unpublished data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>), which could result in local extinction if populations cannot be replenished by immigration from other pools.
