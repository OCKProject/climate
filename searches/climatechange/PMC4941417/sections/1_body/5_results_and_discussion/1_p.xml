<p class="p">We investigated potential effects of decreasing hydroperiods on population growth rate and extinction probability of a fairy shrimp model species by constructing a matrix population model that was parameterised with realistic life-history values that were based on empirical data. Previous studies have shown that temporary pool zooplankton will face decreasing hydroperiods under climate change
