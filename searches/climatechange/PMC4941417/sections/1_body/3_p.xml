<p class="p">A major limitation of most models that attempt to link life history strategies to population growth under varying environmental quality is that they consider just two potential outcomes for each growing season: successful or non-successful reproduction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. In reality, variation among seasons is typically continuous. It is, however, often difficult to define an appropriate function that directly links the environment to reproductive success. Instead, some models draw reproduction stochastically for each growing season from a set of estimates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. The advantage of our model species is that active populations are strictly dependent on the presence of water and that we are able to directly link inundation length to reproductive output, as supported by empirical data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. This presents a conceptual extension of an earlier model by Ripley and co-workers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> for Californian fairy shrimp, in which reproductive output among growing seasons was drawn randomly from a set of likely values. Furthermore, analogous to a recent seed bank model for desert annuals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, we account for age-specific life-history trait values.
