<p class="p">Climate change is expected to drive a rapid increase in species extinction rates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Therefore, vulnerability assessment of organisms is needed and should integrate measures of their exposure, sensitivity and adaptability to predicted change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. In terms of exposure, temporary pool species are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change because shortening hydroperiods (i.e. length of the wet phase) are expected to impose more stringent time constraints on them to reach maturation and reproduce successfully

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Yet, the degree to which shortening hydroperiods affect population demographics remains understudied. Moreover, it is unclear whether changes in life history traits could allow populations to adapt to decreasing hydroperiods
