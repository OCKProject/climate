<p class="p">The direct link between reproduction and hydroperiod, which can be reconstructed for our study system, is a necessary step to investigate the potential consequences of different climate change scenarios on temporary pool biota. First of all, we predict that our simulations will demonstrate that a decrease in median hydroperiod negatively affects long term growth rates and increases the probability of population extinction. Second, we expect that changes in life-history parameters can compensate for these negative effects. Finally, we anticipate that the relative importance of different life-history parameters for long term population growth will depend on the hydroperiod.</p>
