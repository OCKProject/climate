<p class="p">Watering at the beginning of the season would also help to offset the negative impacts of changes in nesting phenology at Playa Grande, where the median nesting date shifted 0.3 days yr

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. These changes in phenology are in contrast to studies postulating that increasing ocean temperatures could cause earlier nesting, exposing nests to more favorable conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. 90% poaching of eggs between the mid-1970’s and early 1990’s resulted in a lost generation of nesting females [

Beach protection began in the 1990’s and as these nests hatched and females reached reproductive maturity, the nesting population has shifted to a larger proportion of younger and inexperienced females, which tend to nest later in the season [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. As the nesting season progresses, temperature increases while precipitation decreases, exposing nests to less favorable incubation conditions, which results in lower hatching and emergence success [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Later nesting in the season at Playa Grande will place nests in increasingly adverse conditions, likely exacerbating the impacts of climate change. Such shifts make the development of mitigation strategies at the beginning of the nesting season particularly pertinent for this population of leatherbacks.
