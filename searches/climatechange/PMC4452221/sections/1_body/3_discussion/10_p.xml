<p class="p">Altering sand temperatures not only changes hatchling sex ratios but may also impact the operational sex ratios of adults [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and population dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Reconstructing a long-term data set of incubation temperatures is essential for determining mitigation measures because short-term data sets may not encompass variation in hatchling sex ratios that can occur over multiple decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Thus, while sex ratios may be female-biased over a few years, over longer time spans the operational sex ratio may ultimately approach 1:1. Furthermore, natural shifts in hatchling sex ratios towards more females as temperatures increase may be adaptive, as it increases fecundity [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], although taken to extremes, female biased sex ratios can negatively impact populations. Understanding natural shifts and annual variation in hatchling sex ratios and how these impact population dynamics should be the preliminary steps in developing an appropriate mitigation strategy.
