<p class="p">The same general trends were evident at 75cm, but values tended to be higher than at 45cm. The initial water content in these plots was 0.040 Â± 0.17 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. When water treatment stopped, water content in the low exposed and low shaded plots fell to 0.032 and 0.025 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In the remaining plots, water content increased to 0.080, 0.066, 0.085, and 0.074 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in the average exposed, average shaded, high exposed, and high shaded plots, respectively. Between the end of watering and the following month, water content remained the same in the low shaded plots and decreased to 0.028, 0.055, 0.030, 0.051, and 0.038 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in the low exposed, average exposed, average shaded, high exposed and high shaded plots, respectively. One month after watering stopped, in exposed plots, those with high water amounts had nearly double the water content of those with low water treatments.
