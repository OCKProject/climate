<p class="p">There was little fluctuation in sand temperature in experimental plots, as indicated by small standard deviations in HOBO temperature measurements. Average temperatures recorded in the exposed plots were 29.84 ± 0.28°C and 30.05 ± 0.06°C at 45cm and 75cm, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.g002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). In the shaded plots, respective average temperatures were 27.21 ± 0.11°C and 28.30 ± 0.10°C at 45cm and 75cm (
