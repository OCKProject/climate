<p class="p">At 75cm, there were significant differences in temperature between control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.05 all cases), but not among the treatments (p &gt; 0.05). In exposed plots at 75cm, temperatures in the low water treatment averaged 0.6°C lower than in plots with no water and temperatures in average and high treatments were 0.7°C lower (

Low, average, and high water treatments in shaded plots were respectively 0.9°C, 1.2°C, and 1.4°C lower than temperatures in the same water treatment in exposed plots (
