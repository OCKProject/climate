<p class="p">Nest irrigation and shading have been proposed as possible climate mitigation measures for sea turtle nests [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In natural nests, shading produced by vegetation lowers incubation temperatures and results in the production of higher proportions of male hatchlings [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Shading by planting trees lowers nest temperatures and produces hatchlings with higher locomotion performance than nests that are not shaded [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. For some populations, hatchling sex ratios could reach 100% female by 2070 [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and shading of leatherback nests has been shown to increase male production without compromising hatchling fitness or hatching success [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Likewise, experimental watering under certain conditions can lower nest temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] in the same manner that rainfall can lower incubation temperatures, resulting in the production of males [
