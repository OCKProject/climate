<p class="p">Temperature also interacts with water content of the sand to influence hatchling morphology in turtles. Shorter incubation times experienced by warmer nests can result in less yolk being converted to tissue [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], which results in the production of hatchlings that are smaller [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] but have higher energy stores. Smaller turtle hatchlings are less adept at terrestrial motion [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], crawl slower, and swim slower [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], but may survive better in energy-poor environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, larger hatchlings are less available to gape-limited predators. Furthermore, their faster swimming ability likely enables them to more successfully navigate through the large aggregations of predators offshore from the nesting beach [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Assuming hatchlings have access to adequate food resources upon entering the water, the decreased size and speed of hatchlings from warmer and drier nests likely results in lower survival rates.
