<p class="p">A reliable interpretation of climate projections should be based on multi-model ensembles [

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Our analysis of the small EURO-CORDEX ensemble consisting of five models shows robust results regarding the sign of change for several regions in Europe. A statistical analysis of the output of 22 GCMs from the CMIP5 ensemble supports our findings, as the duration of periods with low values of the

Furthermore, data at turbine hub height should be made available. Ongoing downscaling experiments within the new CMIP6 CORDEX initiative [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] will allow to assess the impact of climate change on system integration of intermittent renewables for various regions in the same manner. This should include a detailed and explicit analysis on the projected changes of both wind and PV. In conclusion, our work contributes to highlight the importance of integrated energy and climate research to enable a sustainable energy transition.
