<p class="p">The duration of low-wind periods is strongly associated with the seasonal wind variability, e.g. low-wind periods are more frequent over Western Europe in summer than in winter. To assess the implications of this connection in a changing climate, we evaluated the distribution of durations of low-wind periods also per season, and computed the changes between the distributions for the end of the century vs. recent climate conditions. We found that in countries where the seasonal wind variability increases, the duration of low-wind periods also increases (in most cases) in all seasons, but primarily in summer. This result is robust for all five models. The same effect, albeit in the reverse direction, is observed for e.g. Spain, where a decreasing duration of low-wind periods is coupled to the decreasing seasonal wind variability and hence to shorter durations of low-wind periods in summer. We note that there are also countries where the probability for long low-wind periods increases, but no change in the seasonal wind variability is observed (e.g. Finland). Hence, we conclude that the change of seasonality and duration are indeed highly coupled, but one effect is not simply the consequence of the other.</p>
