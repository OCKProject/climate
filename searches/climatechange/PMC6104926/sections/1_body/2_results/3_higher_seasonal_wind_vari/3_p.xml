<p class="p">For the perfectly interconnected European power system, four of the five models predict an increasing seasonal wind variability in the range of 4.1 to 10.4%. Thus, the lower seasonal wind variability on the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Croatia cannot totally compensate the higher seasonal wind variability in the other European countries. In contrast, HadGEM2-ES predicts a decrease of -2.8%.</p>
