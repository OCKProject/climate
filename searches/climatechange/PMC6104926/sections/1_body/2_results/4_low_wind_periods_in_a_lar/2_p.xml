 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g008" class="xref">Fig 8b</xref>). The 90% quantile of the duration increases for 16 models and remains unchanged for the remaining six models, while the 95% quantile increases for 18 of the 22 models. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g008" class="xref">Fig 8b</xref> shows that the five models of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble (shown as filled circles) form a representative subset of the CMIP5 ensemble since their results are well distributed within the range of the majority of all models and thus do not contain outliers. Hence, the large CMIP5 ensemble corroborates our previous findings, predicting an increase of the likelihood for long periods with low wind power output for a strong climate change scenario.
