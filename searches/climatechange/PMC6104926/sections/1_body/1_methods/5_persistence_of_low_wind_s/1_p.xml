<p class="p">We measure the probability for long low-wind periods during which a high amount of energy is required from storage devices and backup power plants. Therefore, we identify all periods for which the wind power generation is continuously smaller than average (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) &lt; 〈
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>〉) and record their duration 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>. We decided to choose 〈
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>〉 as threshold value because we are interested in long periods of underproduction, which cause the storage to become depleted such that backup energy is required. From the single durations 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>, we can estimate a probability distribution. Extreme events are quantified by the 95% quantile of the distribution.
