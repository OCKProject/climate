<p class="p">To obtain the gross generation per country, we equally distribute wind farms on grid points for which the local average wind yield is higher than the country average (see Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The distribution is fixed using historical reanalysis data from ERA-Interim [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] downscaled by the EURO-CORDEX initiative [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] to guarantee consistency (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g001" class="xref">Fig 1b</xref>). We do not use the wind farm distribution as of today because installed capacities in a fully-renewable power system will be much higher and also more widespread than they are today such that wind parks will be built in yet unused locations. Furthermore, it was shown in [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] that different wind farm distributions do not significantly affect the results (see also Figs D-F in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s004" class="xref">S4 Appendix</xref> where we tested a homogeneous wind farm distribution within each country).
