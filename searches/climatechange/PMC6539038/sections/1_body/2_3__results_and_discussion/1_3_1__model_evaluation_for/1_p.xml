 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01528-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the statistical comparisons between the observations and the modeling results from PREMET. OBS and SIM are represented the observation and simulation. For T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the model slightly overvalues T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at all sites, which might result from the uncertainty of urban canopy and surface parameters [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, the overestimation is acceptable because the MB values of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are only 0.5–1.7 °C, the RMSE of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is 2.8–3.9 °C, and the CORR between observations and simulations are over 0.8 at all sites (statistically significant at the 95% confidence level). Moreover, the lowest value 0.5 °C for MB and the highest value 0.9 for CORR show that the best simulation of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is at NJ. For RH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, though the modeling results are slightly underestimated, the CORR values are over 0.8 at most sites. Therefore, the simulations for RH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are relatively acceptable. The lowest value 0.7 for CORR is at SH, which may be attributed to the uncertainty of the land-use data that cannot well describe waters around SH [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. For WS
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>, the modeling values are overestimated at HZ and SH but underestimated at NJ. The CORR (close to 0.5) for WS
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> is the lowest in three meteorological factors. The wind components were not simulated very well, just as in previous studies, which may be caused by urban canopy parameters [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Compared with previous studies, the biases in this study are acceptable.
