<p class="p">With respect to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, the CORRs are more than 0.6 at most sites. The lowest value for MB (âˆ’1.2 ppb) and the highest CORR value (close to 0.7) indicate that the simulation at SH is good. However, the modeling results overestimate O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations at NJ and HZ, and the values of MB are around 8.0. These biases might be related to the modeled stronger solar radiation reaching the surface, which can cause positive biases in T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and thereby produces more O

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration uncertainty. In addition, there are also some uncertainties in the emission, which might cause O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration bias.
