 <sub class="sub">3</sub> at the first model layer over the YRD during afternoon (13:00â€“16:00 LST) from FUTMET and PREMET. For PREMET, low values (&lt;0.3) of H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are mainly located in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and most land areas in the northern YRD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a). The results mean that the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemistry in the typical cities and the northern YRD is VOC-sensitive and that VOCs should be preferentially reduced in these areas at present. However, in the future, more and more areas in YRD are covered by high values of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b). The values in the vast majority of grids are over 0.8, which means the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemistry is NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>-sensitive in most parts of the YRD. Lower values (&lt;0.4) only appear around Shanghai. The values in the cities of southern Jiangsu and northeastern Zhejiang are also close to 0.4. The change in the distribution pattern of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> implies that O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemistry in the future of YRD tends to be insensitive to VOCs and is more easily affected by NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, which is in accordance with the findings of Xie et al. [
