 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can enhance the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> photochemical reactions over the entire YRD. Although the increase of PBLH in the north can dilute O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration in lower atmosphere, the decrease in the south can increase the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> pollution level. However, the strengthened southerly wind can transport more O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from the south to north, which may increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the north and decrease O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the south. The change trend of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the daytime might be different from that at night. The increase of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can enhance the titration reaction between NO and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. The increase of PBLH in the north can bring surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to the higher layers. The southerly wind may increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the north but decrease it in the south. Consequently, it is hard to tell the change of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> just by the changes in meteorological factors either in the daytime or at night. Further analyses are needed.
