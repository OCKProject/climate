 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the changes at night (from 19:00 to 6:00 LST). For T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a), it is predicted to increase about 1.9 °C over the entire YRD, with the higher increases over 5.0 °C in the southwest. The increments are slightly higher than those in the daytime, which may be related to more clouds at night. More clouds may strengthen the insulation effect. For absolute humidity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b), the regional mean changing value (9.6 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) is smaller than that in the daytime, related to a weaker evaporation at night. For PBLH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c), higher increasing values occur in the southwest of the YRD, with a maximum of 268.6 m. The pattern is similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, implying the effect of air temperature on PBLH. For wind field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>d), due to the rising of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the wind speed increases as well. The regional average increase is 0.8 m/s, and the maximum increase is 3.9 m/s. For the wind direction, the southerly wind dominates the region at night just as the changes in the daytime.
