<p class="p">The regional meteorological changes caused by global climate change are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The values in these figures present the differences between FUTMET and PREMET. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the changes during the daytime (from 7:00 to 18:00 LST (Local standard time)). For solar radiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a), the values in the land area of YRD significantly increase, with the average value of 33.2 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The maximum increase of 76.0 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> appears in the southwest. The changing pattern of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b) is similar to that of solar radiation. The average increase of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is predicted to be 1.5 °C over the entire region. High values can be found in the southwest of the YRD, with a maximum of 3.6 °C. The good relevancy between 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,b can be explained by the fact that the increase of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is caused by solar radiation. For absolute humidity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c), it increases over 10.0 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> in the northern and central YRD, which is related to the precipitation increase with the value over 4.0 mm in those areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d). However, in the southern YRD, the air becomes dryer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c), caused by the precipitation decrease there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d). For planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>e), it increases by the maximum value (about 234.3 m) in the southern YRD, which can be attributed to high increments of solar radiation and air temperature. However, PBLH decreases by 200.0 m in most of northern and central areas. The decreases may be caused by the small increase of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the high humidity, which can increase latent heat and lower PBLH. For WS
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>f), the change pattern is similar to that of T
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The regional mean increment is 1.2 m/s, and the high increases appear in the south with the maximum value of 4.2 m/s. For the wind direction, a southerly wind will dominate the YRD in the future under the strengthening of the Northwest Pacific Subtropical High.
