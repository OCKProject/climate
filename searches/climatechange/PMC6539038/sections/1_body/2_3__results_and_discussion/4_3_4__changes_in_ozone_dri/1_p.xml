 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the differences of surface ozone between FUTMET and PREMET in the YRD. During the daytime (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a), O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increases in the north but decreases in the south. The high increase values with a maximum of 18.5 ppb are along the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, while the high reductions (over −15.1 ppb) are mainly in the inland areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces. At night (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b), the change pattern of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is similar to that in the day, but the increase and the decrease values are lower. The regional averaged change value is just −0.2 ppb, the maximum increase is 17.5 ppb, and the maximum decrease is about −12.0 ppb. Less O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> variations at night may be attributed to nocturnal O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemical reactions. Moreover, the above O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> change patterns are similar to those of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, VOCs, and CO, implying that O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> changes are tightly related to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursors and are highly affected by chemical processes.
