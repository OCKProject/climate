<p class="p">At night, the changes in three main processes are smaller. The changes in Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> vary from −1.0 to 2.0 ppb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>a). The decreases of Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> mainly appear in the north, which should be attributed to the enhancement of an O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> titration reaction with NO at night due to temperature increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a) and the sufficient NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> in the north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b). In a similar way, the increases in the south are related with the decrease of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b), which would weaken the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> consumption reaction. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b shows that the changes in Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are between −3.0 and 2.0 ppb in most areas. O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> accumulation along the Nanjing-Shanghai line is due to the strengthening of the easterly wind. The changes in Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> range between −3.0 and 2.0 ppb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>c). The decreases of Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are related to the increases of nocturnal PBLH over the YRD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c). The maximum increases of Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are in the south of the YRD. The increases are caused by great increases of wind speed that can weaken the dry deposition in this area (
