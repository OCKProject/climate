 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows the different spatial distributions of major individual O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> formation processes between FUTMET and PREMET during the daytime. The changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemical production (Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) vary from −2 to 4 ppb/h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a). The increases of Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> occur in most areas of the YRD, which should be induced by enhanced gas phase reactions related to the increases of solar radiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a) and surface air temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b). The higher increments over 3.0 ppb/h are mainly located along the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, which is also the area with great increase of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursor concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,c,e). Over the southern YRD, the decreases of absolute humidity and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursor concentration should result in reductions of Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in extensive areas, with the maximum decrease about −2.2 ppb/h to the south of Hangzhou. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b illustrates that the changes in transport process of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) are between −3.0 to 4.0 ppb/h, which is closely related to the variation of horizontal wind speed and wind direction [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> rises up over 0–4.0 ppb/h in most areas of the northern YRD, with the higher increments over 2.1 ppb around Shanghai. The decreases of Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are mainly located in the southern YRD. The change pattern of Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> further proves that the strengthened southerly wind in the YRD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>f) can bring O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from the south to the north. For the vertical mixing and dry deposition process (Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), it ranges between –4.0 to 4.0 ppb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>c). Though PBLH would decrease in the north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>e, may increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> at surface), Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> can produce more O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in lower atmospheres (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a) and more O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> would be transported to the upper atmospheric layer or deposition to the ground (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b). Thus, Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the northern YRD mainly decreases. In the south, however, there is little change in Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (0–1.0 ppb/h). The high values close to some cities would be caused by the local atmospheric circulation related to urban heat island [
