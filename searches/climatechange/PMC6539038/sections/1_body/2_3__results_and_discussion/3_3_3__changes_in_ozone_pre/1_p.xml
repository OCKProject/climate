 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b). The increases appear in the north of Shanghai and Hangzhou. In the daytime, the maximum increase is 6.5 ppb in Shanghai. At night, the maximum increase is 11.9 ppb in Hangzhou. These increases of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> match the decreases of PBLH, implying the accumulation of air pollutants under worse diffusion conditions. Also, the stronger southerly wind in the daytime can lead to increases of concentration in the north. However, more high values appear in Hangzhou at night than in the daytime, caused by an enhancement of the westerly wind along Nanjing-Shanghai line, which blocks the northward transportation of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>. The change patterns of VOCs and CO are similar to that of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>. The higher increments also appear in the northern YRD. The maximum changes for VOCs are 3.7 ppb (
