<p class="p">To understand the impacts of the changes caused by climate change in individual atmospheric process, the monthly mean differences between FUTMET and PREMET for the CHEM, VMIX, and ADVT processes of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> in the YRD are investigated. The contributions of VMIX and ADVT to NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> variations are the largest, while CHEM has little effect. Thus, only the changes in the VMIX and ADVT processes of NOx (respectively referred to as Vmix_NOx, and Advt_NOx hereafter) at the surface are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a, during the daytime, the maximum increase of Vmix_NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> locates at the center of the YRD with a value of 8.1 ppb/h. This high value should be attributed to the decrease of PBLH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>e) and higher NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions in this area. At night, however, Vmix_NOx decreases in most of the YRD with a maximum reduction of âˆ’7.2 ppb/h. The decreases are related to the increase of PBLH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c), which can bring more pollutants to the higher levels. For Advt_NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, its changes are closely related to the variations of wind fields. During the daytime, the increments of Advt_NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> are more than 1.5 ppb/h in the north of the YRD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>c), implying that the southerly wind (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>f) brings more NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> to the north. At night, NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> is transported from south to north under the dominant southerly wind in most parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>d). However, there are high values of Advt_NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> to the south of Nanjing-Shanghai line, which may be connected with a strengthening of the easterly wind in this area in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>d.
