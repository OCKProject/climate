<p class="p">WRF-Chem version 3.5 contains a simple process analysis function, which can present the contributions of individual atmospheric processes, including chemical reaction (CHEM), vertical mixing coupled with dry deposition (VMIX), and advection transportation with horizontal and vertical components (ADVT). These variables can show the relative significance of each process and provide a particular interpretation of air pollution. In this study, by comparing the values of CHEM, VMIX, and ADVT from FUTMET with those from PREMET, we can figure out how the changes in meteorological factors influence the individual atmospheric processes of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chemistry. Moreover, the O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> change (accumulation or consuming) in different processes is called Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the CHEM process, Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the VMIX process, and Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the ADVT process. The unit of Chem_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, Vmix_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and Advt_O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is ppb/h, implying the changes in one hour in this process.
