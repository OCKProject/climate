<p class="p">In this study, WRF-Chem version 3.5 (NOAA, Colorado, USA) was applied to investigate the impacts of climate change on air quality over the YRD. WRF-Chem is a new generation of air quality modeling system, which is composed of the meteorological component (WRF) and the air quality component (Chem). The two components are fully coupled, and they use the same coordinates and physical parameterizations [
