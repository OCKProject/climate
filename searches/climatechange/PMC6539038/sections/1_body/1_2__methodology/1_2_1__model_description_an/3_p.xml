 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01528-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The Purdue Lin microphysics scheme [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] makes progress that the addition of a snow field to the cloud model significantly modifies the microphysical processes; it is more consummate. In the RRTM (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model) longwave radiation scheme, the speed of execution compares favorably with those of other rapid radiation models, and the model can be used in general circulation models [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The Goddard shortwave radiation scheme results in considerable improvement in reproducing the model’s thermal structure, such as the zonal mean air temperature, its latitudinal gradient, and vertically integrated temperature [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In the Kain–Fritsh cumulus parameterization scheme, the specific formation of the modifications can produce desired effects in numerical weather prediction and render the scheme closer to observations and cloud-resolving modeling studies [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The NOAH/LSM (NCAR, Boulder, CO, USA) scheme can not only provide reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat flues but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The MYJ (Mellor–Yamada–Janjic) PBL scheme makes progress on the basis of the MY PBL scheme, and the new scheme for calculating the MY level 2.5 master length scale is rectified [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The chemical mechanism used to simulate gas concentration is the Carbon-Bond Mechanism version Z (CBMZ). The CBMZ is developed from a new lumped-structure mechanism, largely based on the widely used Carbon Bond Mechanism (CBM-IV). Major improvements include a revised inorganic chemistry, an explicit treatment of the lesser reactive paraffins, methane, and ethane [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The adopted option for aerosol is the four-bin sectional Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC). MOSAIC is found to be in excellent agreement with a benchmark version of the model using a rigorous solver for integrating the stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Therefore, MOSAIC is a good choice in air quality and regional/global aerosol models [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The initial and boundary chemical conditions are derived from the modeling results of the global chemistry transport model MOZART-4.
