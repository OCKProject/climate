 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, three nested domains were used. The model domains were centered at (32.8° N, 87.5° E) with Lambert Conformal Conic projection. The grid sizes of these domains were 56 × 42, 109 × 82, and 178 × 136, with grid spacings of 81, 27, and 9 km, respectively. The outer domain covered a fairly large area of East Asia. The inner domain covered the YRD and its surrounding waters. For all domains, there were 31 vertical layers from the surface to the model top of 100 hPa, with about 10 layers in the planetary boundary layer.
