<p class="p">The present and future climate data are used to drive WRF as the initial meteorological fields and boundary conditions. These data are obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) outputs with a horizontal resolution of T85 (about 1.41°). The CCSM4 RCP4.5 outputs for 2050, 2051, and 2052 used in this study are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. RCP4.5 is a midline future climate scenario for CO

The data are also compared with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) data with the spatial resolution of 1°, and the difference is ignorable.
