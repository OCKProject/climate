However, the Chinese government has formulated a series of strict emission reduction policies to protect air quality, implying that the hypothetical increase of emissions is inapplicable. On the other hand, the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the changes of meteorological factors under future climate and their effects on individual processes of O
