<p class="p">This study provides us a scope of understanding how the future climate affects the surface ozone in the YRD region. However, only the IPCC RCP4.5 scenario from CCSM4 is considered. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, the future meteorological inputs should be provided by more global climate models based on more future climate scenarios, including Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios. Moreover, the manmade emissions may decrease in the future, and the land-use types may continue to change for decades. These future changes should be taken into consideration in the follow-up studies as well.</p>
