<p class="p">For the effects of climate change on air pollutants, the change patterns of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursors (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, VOC, and CO) are similar, with an increase in the north and a decrease in the south. The maximum increments of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, VOC, and CO in the day can reach 6.5, 3.7, and 134.3 ppb, respectively. Those at night are 11.9, 6.1, and 154.1 ppb, respectively. According to a process analysis, their increases are related with the decreases of PBLH and the input effect of stronger southerly wind, while the decreases are attributed to the output effect of the stronger southerly wind. Surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> variations will increase in the north and decrease in the south during the daytime. According to process analysis, the increase of surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the north is dominated by gas phase chemical process related to the increases of solar radiation, air temperature, and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> precursors. The decrease in the south is mainly caused by the transport process changing with the strengthened southerly wind. During the nighttime under the future climate, the surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> changes amplitude is less than the daytime, with the same change pattern as that in the day. The less O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> variations at night can be attributed to an O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> titration reaction with NO, the changes in NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> concentrations, and the increases of nocturnal PBLH. Moreover, climate change can affect the chemical relationship between O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and its precursors. With the aid of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>â€“NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>-VOC sensitivity over the YRD region is found to be easily affected by NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> in the future.
