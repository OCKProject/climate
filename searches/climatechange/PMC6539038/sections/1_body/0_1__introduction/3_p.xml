<p class="p">With rapid economic development and increasing energy consumption, many regions in China are facing O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> pollution [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Several researchers linked it with climate change and predicted future O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> pollution in China. Based on the simulations from MOZART-2.4, Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found that O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration might increase by 1–5% from 1990 to 2090 in the east of China for the scenario B1 and that the value might be 3–12% for A1FI. Using GEOS-Chem driven by GISS GCM (NASA, Washington, DC, USA), Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] revealed that climate change could increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the east of China and decrease O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the west of China from 2000 to 2050, and 40% of the increase might result from the strengthened biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emission. With the aid of WRF-Chem driven by CCSM3, Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] found that climate change and biogenic emission could result in the increase of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> by 1.6 ppb (−5 to 5 ppb) over South China in 2050, while the uncontrolled anthropogenic emissions would increase O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> up to 12.8 ppb. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] predicted the future O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> trend in Hong Kong and indicated that the pollution would continue to rise until 2025. By using WRF-CALGRID (ARB, Sacramento, CA, USA) driven by CCSM3, Xie et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] studied the variation trend of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. They found that the variations in meteorological fields caused by climate change could result in an increase (5 to 15 ppb) in the north and a decrease (−5 to −15 ppb) in the south and that the enhanced natural emissions could contribute approximately 20% to the surface O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increase, with the biggest increase up to 2.4 ppb. Obviously, the trend and the magnitude of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> variations resulted from climate change, varying from region to region in China. Despite a couple of investigations in these dynamic economic regions, more studies are needed. Moreover, among current studies, most researchers only focused on the changes in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentration, and few have emphasized the variations of the transportation, diffusion, chemical reaction, and deposition processes of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>.
