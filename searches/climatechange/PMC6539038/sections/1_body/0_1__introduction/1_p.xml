<p class="p">At present, climate change and ambient air quality deterioration are serious issues of the atmospheric environment. In the past, they were separately studied by researchers and policymakers. As the research on the relationship between weather, climate, and air pollution deepened, the interaction between climate change and air quality has drawn more concern [
