<p class="p">Climate variables were related to bird distribution supporting the presence of more pipits and chiffchaffs in warmer sectors (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Preferences for warmer areas could be explained by the predicted direct effect of low temperatures on thermoregulation costs (see 
 <xref rid="sec001" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Introduction</xref>). In an area dominated by cold mountains and highlands (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), where most sectors show mean winter temperatures (mean ± SE: 9.36°C ± 0.18; min-max: -2.2 to 16.7°C; n = 493; see 
 <xref rid="sec005" ref-type="sec" class="xref">methods</xref>) under the usual thermoneutral zone of passerines [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], birds may be forced to increase metabolism [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] or to leave colder sectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In addition to this effect of thermal landscape on bird distribution, meadow pipits were positively related to precipitation. Autumn and winter rains mitigate the effect of summer drought in the Mediterranean and favour primary productivity and food availability for wintering birds [

 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This effect could be magnified by the use of ground by the meadow pipits as feeding substratum [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In the Mediterranean region, grass growth and the superficial activity of ground invertebrates are strongly related to the moisture produced by autumn and winter rains on dry ground layers resulting from summer drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In this way, more precipitation will result in more suitable food patches for this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Thus, it can be concluded that rain-mediated productivity and thermal landscapes can provide a causal explanation of climate features affecting the distribution of these small passerines in the study area.
