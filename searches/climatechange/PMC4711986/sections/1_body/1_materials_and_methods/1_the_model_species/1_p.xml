<p class="p">The meadow pipit (mean body mass 18.4 g; [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]) feeds on invertebrates in meadows and grasses of open habitat patches [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The chiffchaff (7.8 g) feeds on insects within a broader set of substrata and occurs in tree- and shrub-covered habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These passerines were selected as model species for two reasons. First, they do not breed in the study area (the meadow pipit) or mainly breed in some areas of the northern Iberian Peninsula (the chiffchaff; [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]). Thus, most if not all birds wintering in the study area are migratory individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This trait is interesting from a methodological point of view because it will attenuate the confounding effects of local conspecifics on the abundance patterning of migratory individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In this way, predictions based on ring recoveries in wintering grounds can be validated by the abundance distribution of the same migratory populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Second, pipits and chiffchaffs are small insectivorous passerines that occur in a broad range of habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Small body size makes birds more sensitive to temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and a diet based on insects makes them potentially ubiquitous since these invertebrates are available in a wide range of habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This implicitly assumes the potential of these species to track climate changes across the entire study area.
