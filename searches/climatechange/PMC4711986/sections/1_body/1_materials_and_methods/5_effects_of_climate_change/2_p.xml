<p class="p">Present occurrence probabilities were subtracted from future occurrence probabilities to map the distribution of increasing and decreasing climate suitability sectors. To explore the spatial distribution of climate and climate suitability changes for pipits and chiffchaffs, we distributed 500 random points over the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco (there were actually 493 because seven points were discarded for lack of data). In each point, the reported changes in climate suitability and climate variables were used as response variables and latitude, longitude, latitude x longitude, altitude and altitude
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (to detect hump shaped distributions along the elevation gradient) were used as predictors. Present and future scores were compared by repeated measures ANOVA and the spatial trends of changes by GLM analyses. All cartographic data were managed with QGIS 2.8 and GRASS GIS in 10 x 10 km squares [
