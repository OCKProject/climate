<p class="p">Migratory birds are sensitive to climate change in the different geographical sectors along their migratory journeys [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. This itinerancy makes it difficult to explore the potential effect of climate change on these species [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In the case of European migratory birds, it has been predicted that many trans-Saharan species will reduce and shift their wintering range due to the effect of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], but little is known about the fate of wintering grounds in the Palaearctic [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Some evidence suggests a shift northwards of wintering ranges in some European birds but few studies have investigated the impacts of climate change on wintering areas in the Mediterranean Basin [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. This is, however, a main wintering ground for many European bird populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] because the arrival of autumn rains mitigates the limiting effects of summer drought initiating a period of primary productivity, invertebrate activity and fruit ripening suitable for wintering birds [
