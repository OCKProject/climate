<p class="p">As part of the effort to observe and detect long‐term change, a network of open ocean observatories aims to provide long time series of biogeochemical data on both state and rate variables. Previous work has demonstrated that ~30–40 years of continuous data are needed to distinguish a climate change trend in chlorophyll concentration or PP from the background natural variability (Henson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Metrics derived from chlorophyll data, for example bloom timing, are not able to reduce the 30–40 year timescale for trend detection (Henson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and, in addition, gaps in the time series strongly impact the detection of trends (Beaulieu 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Nevertheless, some of the longer‐running ocean time series stations are now nearing this predicted threshold for the climate change trend in chlorophyll or PP to become detectable. However, time series stations typically record a variety of parameters beyond chlorophyll or PP; as suggested by Henson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) the climate change‐driven trend may be more rapidly detectable in other biogeochemical data, a hypothesis which has yet to be tested. Financial and logistical constraints limit the network of time series stations to a relatively small number, mostly close to land to allow regular servicing. As it is unfeasible to fill the ocean with observing stations, an additional important consideration is the size of their ‘footprint’ – or the extent to which a station is representative of a larger region. Large data‐poor regions of the ocean may compromise our ability to detect long‐term trends on large scales. In this study we aim to assess when and where climate change may be detectable with the current monitoring network of open ocean observatories.
