<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the footprint size at selected BGC‐SOs for all eight variables. Generally, the stations are representative of biogeochemical properties in fairly localized areas, ~1.1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> on average. Stations in the Arabian Sea, North Pacific and Southern Ocean are representative of the largest areas (e.g. ~4.85 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for A7, median for all eight variables), whilst those in the Mediterranean are representative of the smallest regions (e.g. ~0.18 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for LION, median for all eight variables). The variables with the largest footprints are SST, pH and nitrate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), but nevertheless the current network of BGC‐SOs is still only representative of 13–15% of the ocean (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). A second group of variables (chlorophyll, PP, nondiatom PP and export) are the biological response to changing physical and chemical conditions and have smaller footprints so that BGC‐SOs represent 11–12% of the ocean. Oxygen concentration has the smallest footprint, with only 9% of the ocean covered by existing BGC‐SOs. For all variables, any region not in close proximity to a BGC‐SO is unrepresented, mainly in the Southern Hemisphere and Arctic. A table with full listing of areal extent represented by each BGC‐SO and variable is in Table S3.
