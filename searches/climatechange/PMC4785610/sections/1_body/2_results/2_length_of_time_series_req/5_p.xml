 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> calculated across all eight variables is plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The regions where detecting trends requires the shortest time series of observations (&lt;20 years) are the equatorial Atlantic and Benguela upwelling, in which all variables have relatively short 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) due to strong trends and weak natural variability. With 25 years of data, trends are detectable in large parts of the Indian Ocean, particularly the Arabian Sea, and parts of the South and North Pacific gyres, plus a band at 40°S. Long time series of data (&gt;40 years) are needed to detect trends in parts of the Southern Ocean, Northeast Pacific, South Atlantic gyre and northern North Atlantic. In the case of the North Atlantic (Irminger Basin), all variables except pH require very long time series to detect a trend. For the other regions, 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> is long in all variables except pH, SST and oxygen.
