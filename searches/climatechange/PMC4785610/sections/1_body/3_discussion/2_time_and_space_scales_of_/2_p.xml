 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), we find that chlorophyll and PP require longer time series to detect trends (

A key question arising from the earlier work was whether climate change‐driven trends could be more rapidly detectable in other biogeochemical variables. Here, we find that the answer is generally ‘no’ (except for pH), with oxygen and nitrate concentration, export and nondiatom PP all requiring time series &gt;25 years in length (global median; Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). There are however clear regional differences, with the equatorial Atlantic, Benguela and Arabian Sea requiring fewer years of data to distinguish a trend. In contrast, in parts of the Southern Ocean and Northeast Pacific, detecting trends requires very long records and in some cases changes are nondetectable in the 95 year timescale of the simulations used here. These results are in contrast with the hypothesis that ecosystems can ‘integrate’ the environmental conditions that they experience, improving the signal to noise ratio and permitting detection of weak climate change‐driven trends (Taylor

 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Instead we find that detection time is shorter for environmental forcing factors than for the ecosystem response.
