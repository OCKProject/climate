<p class="p">According to our analysis, some BGC‐SOs have been in operation sufficiently long that climate change trends in some variables should be detectable (Table S2). For example, ALOHA was established in 1988 (~27 years ago at the time of writing) and so climate change trends may now be detectable in their records in all parameters except chlorophyll concentration. Indeed, trends have been identified in pH, PP, SST, chlorophyll concentration and nitrate at ALOHA (Saba

 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The presence of a statistically significant trend in chlorophyll at ALOHA is inconsistent with our estimate of

 <xref rid="gcb13152-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Limitations</xref> section). Other stations need to be in operation for some years more, for example PAP where, although trends in pH may be detectable after 14 years of operation, other variables require ~25 years of data. With some exceptions, the current network of BGC‐SOs has not been in operation sufficiently long to detect climate change‐driven trends.
