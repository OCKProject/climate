The variables used were annual average sea surface temperature (SST), surface pH, surface chlorophyll concentration and surface nitrate concentration, annual integrated PP and nondiatom PP, annual total export flux at 100 m depth, and annual average oxygen concentration averaged over the 200–600 m depth range, which encompasses the main thermocline (Gruber,

These variables were chosen as they are routinely measured at ocean observing stations either autonomously (e.g. temperature, chlorophyll, oxygen) or during regular ship servicing (e.g. PP, export). Additionally, this set of variables is available from a sufficient number of different models to incorporate a quantification of model uncertainty in our analysis.
