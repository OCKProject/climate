<p class="p">To approximate the region over which samples collected at an observing station are representative (the ‘footprint’), pixels which have similar mean and variability to the time series at the station are identified. First, the time series at each station from a 100‐year section of the model control run for each variable is linearly correlated against every other pixel in the model domain. Where the linear correlation is statistically significant at the 95% level (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and where the pixel is within ±2 standard deviations of the time series mean at the station, the pixel is considered to be representative of conditions at that station. Only regions which are positively correlated with the observing station time series, fall within ±2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>, and are contiguous with it are retained for further analysis. In addition, only pixels in which the contiguous patches overlie in at least half of the eight models used here are retained for analysis.
