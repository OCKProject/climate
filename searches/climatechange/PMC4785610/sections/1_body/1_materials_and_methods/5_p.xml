<p class="p">To evaluate the likely realism of the spatial and temporal scales estimated by the model analysis presented here, comparisons to available satellite observations are made. Comparisons of the coefficient of variation and footprint are presented in the Supporting Information. In general, the model‚Äêderived estimates of
