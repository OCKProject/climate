<p class="p">Finally, a note on terminology: here we use the term ‘natural variability’ to indicate interannual, decadal, or multidecadal variability forced by oscillatory or transient conditions (e.g. El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation etc.). In contrast, ‘trends’ is used to refer to long‐term (multidecadal or longer) changes driven by persistent anomalous forcing (in this case global climate change).</p>
