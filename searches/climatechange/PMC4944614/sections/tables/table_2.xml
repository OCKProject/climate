   <p class="p">*Estimates by subtracting the difference between surface air temperature and seawater temperatures at each water depth of the monthly climatological temperature of the control experiment (30-year mean in the pre-industrial condition) from the latest Cretaceous monthly mean surface air temperature over the ocean after average values from the BESTGUESS and BARESOIL simulations

    <sup class="sup">#</sup>Estimates by subtracting the maximum decreasing seawater temperatures at each water depth in each BC ejection scenario of the climate model calculations of this study (
    <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Table 4</xref>) from the latest Cretaceous monthly mean seawater temperature at each water depth (see 0 Tg BC column). Seawater temperature data where late Cretaceous ammonites (Campanian-Maastrichtian) inhabited can be divided into three groups: 16–20 °C (cool water type: green), 21–25 °C (mild water type: pale orange), and 26–32 °C (warm water type: orange) (see text). Solid-framed areas show the survival area estimated. Broken-framed areas show that migration was required for survival. The seawater temperatures at 200-m and 400-m water depths should be slightly higher, because the latest Cretaceous deep water (&gt;1000-m water depths) temperature was ~10 °C higher than that of the present day.
