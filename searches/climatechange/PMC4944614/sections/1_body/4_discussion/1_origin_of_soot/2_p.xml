<p class="p">Dead organisms and crude oil present at the end of the Cretaceous were mixed in the ejecta. Cretaceous carbonate rocks and K/Pg impact breccia from a borehole in the Chicxulub crater contain oil shales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>, but most of the crude oil in the target rocks at Chicxulub was lost during the impact, leaving no direct evidence and no information on the original amounts of crude oil and other organic matter. The K/Pg impact breccias in the Cantarell Field, which is the largest oil field in Mexico and located in the vicinity of the crater, contain massive amounts of crude oil derived from the Late Jurassic (i.e., 90 million years older than the asteroid impact)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref>. This is indirect evidence of the presence of very large amounts of crude oil in the target rocks at the end of the Cretaceous. The crude oil was combusted during the impact, as evidenced by carbon cenospheres from Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand
