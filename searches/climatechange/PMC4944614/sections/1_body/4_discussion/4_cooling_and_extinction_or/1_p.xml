 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>. These ammonites should have inhabited between 200–100-m and 0-m water depths. Inoceramid bivalves were shallow dwellers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" class="xref">52</xref> and became extinct at the K/Pg boundary. Both shallow- and deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera inhabited the surface water (&lt;~100-m water depths) during at least a portion of their lifetimes (&lt;1 year). These extinct marine organisms in the surface water likely suffered from low seawater temperatures resulting from cooling of 2–7 °C, 3–10 °C, and 3–11 °C for the 500-, 1500-, and 2600-Tg BC ejection cases, respectively, within 2–5 years after the impact (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>. The highest temperature during ontogeny may be used to classify ammonites into three groups: cool water type (16–20 °C), mild water type (21–25 °C), and warm water type (26–32 °C). These temperatures are supported by oxygen isotope data of late Cretaceous ammonite shells

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The mild water ammonites could not survive after the impact in the 1500-Tg and 2600-Tg BC cases. The cool water ammonites survived upon migration to shallower parts in these cases. This is consistent with evidence that those ammonites that survived briefly into the Paleocene, and the nautilids that survive to the present day, were significantly more widely distributed than were those that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. The cooling of seawater could have disturbed the physiology and food web of the shallow marine dwellers, such as planktonic foraminifera, ammonites, inoceramids, and marine reptiles, which could have led to their extinction. Deep dwellers such as nautilids, sepia, and benthic foraminifera survived the K/Pg crisis

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Temperature minima occurred within 3–6 years after the impact in 100-m water depths in oceans but within 1–3 years on land. Extinctions in oceans should have followed land plant devastation and extinction of the dinosaurs. In fact, fossil records show that the widely distributed ammonites briefly survived after the fall of Ir
