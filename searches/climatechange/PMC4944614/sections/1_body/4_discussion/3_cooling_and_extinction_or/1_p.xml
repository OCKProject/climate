<p class="p">For the estimated land surface air temperatures, dinosaurs and tropical plants
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref> could have survived only at the low latitudes in the 500-Tg ejection case, may have survived only in the equatorial area in the 1500-Tg ejection case, and could not survive at any location in the 2600-Tg ejection case on land (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>; survival only in summer means extinction). For dinosaurs, this assumes a seasonal migration and a 15 °C monthly average temperature as the lower limit for survival based on correlations of the diversity of dinosaurs vs. paleolatitude
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref> and the summer land surface air temperature vs. paleolatitude
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. For example, the postulated 15 °C monthly average temperature with a seasonal migration can account for dinosaur bones found in the North Slope of Alaska
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>, because the average paleotemperature was 12–15 °C in July (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The temperature limit is consistent with the distribution of recent crocodilians, which are taxonomically and ecologically related to dinosaurs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>, and survive only in areas where the winter temperature in January or July is &gt;15 °C without seasonal migration
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" class="xref">49</xref>. Although small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer, the dinosaurs did not. The different habitats of the dinosaurs and small mammals and reptiles would also have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival
