<p class="p">A soot ejection of 500 Tg could not have caused extinction of the dinosaurs and ammonites, while an ejection of 2600 Tg could have induced extinction of the dinosaurs, crocodilians, and warm-mild water ammonites. Dinosaurs and warm-mild water ammonites could have become extinct, while the crocodilians survived in the 1500-Tg soot ejection case (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">2</xref>). The diminishing photosynthesis and food-web collapse in oceans may have killed the cool-water deep-dwelling ammonites. Therefore, a soot ejection of ~1500 Tg seems to be sufficient for the mass extinction and survival that occurred at the K-Pg boundary, as supported by the correspondence between the model results and the geological record. Our results show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness, in contrast to previous assumptions. The surface cooling was milder than previously thought. Sufficiently colder climates at mid–high latitudes caused extinction of the dinosaurs and crocodilians at mid–high latitudes; the drought accompanied by mild cooling at low latitudes on land led to extinction of the dinosaurs and allowed survival of the crocodilians at low latitudes. The mild cooling with diminishing photosynthesis in the oceans could have caused extinctions of marine organisms such as ammonites, inoceramids, and most planktonic foraminifera, while allowing the survival of deep-sea organisms. The sufficiently colder climates at mid–high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, as well as the limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans occurred a few months to 2 years after the impact, followed by surface water cooling in global oceans within 2 to 6 years after the impact. The climate change could have led to the terrestrial extinctions within a few years, followed by the marine extinctions over several years. If darkness (no sunlight) had occurred for a few years after the impact, the resulting low temperatures would have caused extinction of the crocodilians, birds, and mammals. The cooling would have been mild to allow their survival on land. The stratospheric soot-aerosol can explain the extinction and survival pattern at the K/Pg boundary. Our results show that rapid global climate change can play a major role in driving extinction.
