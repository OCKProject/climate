The deep-dwelling cool-water ammonites first suffered from the cessation of photosynthesis and then from the decrease in seawater temperature. They may have survived the temperature change but not the lack of photosynthesis and resulting lack of a food source. Furthermore, soot from wild fires (~70,000 Tg BC)

Sulfuric acid rain may have also contributed to the marine extinction
