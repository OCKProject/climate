<p class="p">There was consistency between the geological record and the model results on two events: 1) decreasing temperature for the same area assuming ejections of 500–2600 Tg BC by the impact and 2) drought-devastation of land plants at low latitudes. The consistency supports the use of the model results. The geological sea surface temperature (SST) record in the marlstone just above the coarse ejecta at a proximal site on the Gulf Coast showed a rapid 7 °C cooling followed by a gradual increase in SST coinciding with the second input of Ir from the stratosphere (the first Ir concentration at the top of the coarse sedimentary rocks is thought to have been derived from the troposphere)

The 7 °C SST cooling is within the ranges of the model results, that is, 7 °C and 5 °C average SST cooling at the site and over the Gulf of Mexico, respectively, during the three years after the impact, followed by a gradual increase in the 500-Tg BC ejection scenario (
