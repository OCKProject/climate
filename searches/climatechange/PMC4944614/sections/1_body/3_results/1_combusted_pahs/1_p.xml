<p class="p">Coronene, a six-ring PAH, is a hydrocarbon-derived geochemical diagnostic for combustion. Coronene levels (μg/g TOC) were high in the coarse deposits and the Ir layer relative to other strata, and peaked in the fine-grained sediments in the sandstone and Ir layers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The presence of both coronene and glass spherules in the coarse deposits implies that the impact induced extensive combustion. The coronene content in combusted five- to six-ring PAHs is defined by the coronene/(coronene + benzo(e)pyrene + benzo(g,h,i)perylene) [Cor/(Cor + BeP + Bpery)] ratio. The Cor/(Cor + BeP + Bpery)] ratio is extremely high in the K/Pg ejecta, that is, the upper 40 cm of the coarse-ejecta sediments (average: 0.69; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), the Ir layer at Beloc, Haiti (0.73), and the Ir layer (0.88) and in the vicinity of the Ir layer (−2 to + 4 cm) at Caravaca, Spain (0.87 average; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, low coronene content (0.2–0.4) was found in the Maastrichtian deposits at Beloc. The high Cor/(Cor + BeP + Bpery) values at the K/Pg boundary are likely due to an impact with the formation of coronene as the final product, with low values more typical of wildfires
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. The similar values of Cor/(Cor + BeP + Bpery) in the coarse-ejecta sediments, Ir layer, and at Caravaca imply the same source of coronene for the coarse-ejecta sediments and the Ir layer for the proximal and distal sites.
