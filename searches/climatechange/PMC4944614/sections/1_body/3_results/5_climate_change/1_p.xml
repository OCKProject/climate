<p class="p">We performed global climate model calculations to quantify the climate change caused by BC (equivalent to soot) injection for three quantities of BC (see Methods). The BC ejected into the stratosphere spread around the globe within a few months and was gradually deposited on the surface over the following five years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). BC in the stratosphere efficiently absorbs solar radiation and reduces the sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, which leads to heating of the stratospheric atmosphere and cooling of the tropospheric atmosphere (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). The sudden cooling of the surface temperature weakened the hydrologic cycle, resulting in an abrupt and significant decrease in precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In the 500-Tg BC ejection scenario, the global-averaged model results indicated an abrupt decrease (by 50–60%) in sunlight just after the impact, with shortwave radiation gradually recovering over the following 10 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The blocking of sunlight resulted in a decrease in temperature at Earth’s surface, a 6–9 °C cooling that lasted for two years on land, and a 45–70% decrease in precipitation on land over the same period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In the 1500- and 2600-Tg BC ejection cases, abrupt decreases (by 80–85% and 85–90%) in sunlight led to 10–16 °C and 10–18 °C cooling that lasted for three and five years on land and 55–80% and 60–85% decreases in precipitation on land over the same periods, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The temperature and precipitation gradually recovered within 10 years after the impact and the recoveries decreased over the following years. We found that these climate changes strongly depended on latitude in every BC ejection scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The temperature cooling was dominant in the mid-high latitude regions due to the presence of large amounts of BC in the stratosphere in those regions. On the other hand, the cooling was milder in the low latitude regions. However, precipitation substantially decreased on land in those regions over several years after the impact (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> lists the averaged lowest monthly paleotemperature and precipitation over land at 15° latitude intervals for January and July after the impact in the 500-, 1500-, and 2600-Tg BC ejection scenarios.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>, we assumed that the geographical setting and presence of an ice sheet in the modern climate would not have significant effects relevant to the cooling temperatures between 60°N and 60°S.
