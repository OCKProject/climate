 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. The CPI values from the ejecta beds at Beloc decreased from 7 in the first unit to 1 to 2 in the second and third units, increased to 5 in the lower part of the Danian marlstone, decreased to a minimum of 3 in the Ir layer, and then increased to 5 in the Danian limestone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). These values show that the primary source of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes in the second and third units of the coarse ejecta deposits was crude oil, and that the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes in the Ir layer were sourced from both crude oil and dead organisms. The low CPI values suggest that the organisms from which the oil was derived were older than the plants at the time of the impact. This is consistent with &gt;80% of the recovered Cantarell oil being derived from the Late Jurassic
