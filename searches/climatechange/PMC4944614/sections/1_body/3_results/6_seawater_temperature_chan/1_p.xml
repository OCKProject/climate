 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the seawater temperature largely decreased in the surface waters (0–100 m depths, e.g., up to 4 °C, 7 °C, and 9 °C cooling for the 500-, 1500-, and 2600-Tg BC ejection scenarios, respectively, at 2-m water depth in 2–4 years). The temperature reductions at deeper water depths (&gt;200 m) were much slower and smaller than those at surface water depths (e.g., within 1 °C cooling at a 600-m water depth for the three cases in &gt;15 years). The maximum cooling of surface waters appeared 2–6 years after the impact, and the cooling recovered gradually, taking more than a decade.
