<p class="p">The δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C VPDB values for C29 and C31 long-chain 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes decreased (by 3‰) from just above the coarse deposits to just above the Ir layer, with high values in the Ir layer and its vicinity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The high values are considered to be derived from reworked Cretaceous plants, because the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C VPDB values were the same as those in the Maastrichtian deposits. The rebound of δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values coincided with a high coronene ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), implying that the devastation of land vegetation occurred during the marine extinction period at low latitudes. The land plant biomarker cadalene is concentrated within and just below the Ir layer, with levels four-fold higher than those in the Maastrichtian deposits, also implying that land vegetation was devastated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. The peak in cadalene was also recognized at the K-Pg boundary in Caravaca, Spain
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>, implying semiglobal devastation of land plants.
