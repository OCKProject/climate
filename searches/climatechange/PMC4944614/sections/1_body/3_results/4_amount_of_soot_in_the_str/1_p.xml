<p class="p">Because the proportion of soot ejected into the troposphere and stratosphere by the impact is unknown
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>, the amount of soot ejected into the stratosphere has not been determined previously. We estimated the amount of soot in the stratosphere based on the amount of soluble Cor + BeP + Bpery, which are components of soot
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>, in fine sediments containing Ir at a proximal site. We estimated 500, 1500, and 2600 Tg black carbon (BC) as the total soot ejecta (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). These estimates did not include rapid removal processes (within several days) in the stratosphere, probably due to coagulation between BC and other larger-sized materials (e.g., dust), and therefore, the actual BC emission from the impact could be greater. However, because we estimated the mass of the BC ejecta from soluble five- to six-ring PAHs falling from the stratosphere during the few years after the impact, the amount of stratospheric BC, which could have caused climate change over several years, did not change. The amount of burned carbon at Chicxulub was estimated to be 1800–6000 Tg
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>, which may have decreased due to removal associated with coagulation between BC and other larger-sized materials, and is consistent with our estimate of the BC amount.
