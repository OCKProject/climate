<p class="p">Approximately 50–100-g hand-sized rock specimens were powdered for each sample after the removal of any apparent surface contamination. The powdered samples were extracted for 48 h using a Soxhlet apparatus and a dichloromethane:methanol mixture (7:1 v/v). The extracts were dried over Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The concentrated extracts were separated into nine fractions on a silica gel column (0.6 g silica, 63–200 μm) by elution using the following solvents: 2 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (F1a), 4 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (F1b), and 3 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane/toluene 3:1 v/v (F2). The aromatic hydrocarbon fraction (combination of F1b and F2) from each extract was analyzed by gas chromatography (GS)–mass spectrometry. Identification of the organic compounds was performed using a gas chromatograph (model 6893; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) interfaced to a mass-selective detector (model 5973; Agilent).
