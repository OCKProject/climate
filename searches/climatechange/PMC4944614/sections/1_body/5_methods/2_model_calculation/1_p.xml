<p class="p">We used a coupled atmosphereâ€“ocean global climate model developed at the Meteorological Research Institute, MRI- CGCM3
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>, which consists of the atmospheric general circulation model coupled with the land surface model, the ocean general circulation model using the sea ice calculation, and the aerosol chemical transport model. The model can estimate the climate changes caused by aerosols based on the pre-industrial modern climate conditions and current geographical settings. We performed three 15-year experiments using BC ejection due to the asteroid impact (500-Tg, 1500-Tg, and 2600-Tg BC cases) and a 30-year control experiment with no ejection. We evaluated the climate response due to the BC ejection by subtracting the monthly climatology (30-year mean) of the control experiment from the monthly mean results of the other experiments. Detailed descriptions and evaluations of the model calculations are given in the
