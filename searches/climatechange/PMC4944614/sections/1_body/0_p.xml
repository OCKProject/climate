<p class="p">The Chicxulub impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, is the third largest known impact crater (ca. 180 km in diameter) on Earth. The crater was formed by the impact of an asteroid (ca. 10 km in diameter) at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary 66 million years ago, which is marked by a layer of enhanced levels of iridium (Ir)

Marine plankton diversity and marine productivity decreased significantly, accompanied by a biogeochemical collapse, but 90% of benthic foraminiferal species survived the impact, because while there were significant environmental changes in the surface waters, there was little change in the deep sea
