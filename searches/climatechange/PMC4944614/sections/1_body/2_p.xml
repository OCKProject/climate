<p class="p">Soot is a strong light-absorbing aerosol that can have a significant climatic influence
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>, and the atmospheric lifetime of soot particles is longer (on the scale of years) in the stratosphere, although they are efficiently removed from the atmosphere by precipitation (about a week) in the troposphere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. However, the amount of soot in the stratosphere, the coincidence of the extinction and stratospheric soot, and the climatic influence are unknown. To clarify these points, we examined organic molecules and their isotopes in a proximal K/Pg section in Haiti accompanied by coarse-ejecta beds containing microspherules overlain by marlstone, including an iridium (Ir) accumulation layer

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>), and a distal site without coarse-ejecta beds in Spain
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> and then performed climate model calculations. Soot contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as coronene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, which form from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. We estimated the total amount of soot ejected by the impact using the combusted five- to six-ring PAHs [coronene (Cor), benzo(e)pyrene (BeP), benzo(g,h,i)perylene (Bpery)] that remained in the stratosphere. There are two possible origins for the soot at the K/Pg boundary: wildfires
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> and impact target rock
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. The amount of the stratospheric soot estimated here includes the soot from both wild fires and impact target rock. We postulate that all of the stratospheric soot was sourced from the target rock in Chicxulub, Mexico in the model calculation, because (1) most soot particles from present-day wildfire emissions are injected in the troposphere but not into the stratosphere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>, and (2) the sedimentary organic molecule composition indicates the same source for the PAHs from the troposphere and stratosphere, suggesting an enormous cloud of smoke from the Chicxulub crater (see “Origin of soot” in Discussion).
