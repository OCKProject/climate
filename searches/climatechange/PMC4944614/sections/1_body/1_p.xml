<p class="p">The globally intense infrared radiation from ballistically reentering ejecta may have killed unsheltered organisms directly and ignited fires in locations where adequate fuel was available
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. However, the self-shielding from thermal radiation by an impact-ejecta curtain may have prevented widespread wildfire ignition
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. The current hypothesis for their extinction is that an asteroid impact formed condensed sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere, which reflected sunlight, causing global darkness and inducing cessation of photosynthesis, global near-freezing conditions (impact winter), and acid rain

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. However, if this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. Recent impact experiments and model calculations have demonstrated that condensed sulfuric acid aerosols cannot form and persist over long periods following asteroid impacts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. The process leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and various marine groups such as the ammonites and most planktonic foraminifera, accompanied by the survival of mammals, birds, crocodilians, and other species, is therefore unknown.
