 <p class="p">The cotton mealybug, 
  <italic class="italic">Phenacoccus solenopsis</italic> Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is a serious invasive species that significantly damages plants of approximately 60 families around the world. It is originally from North America and has also been introduced to other continents. Our goals were to create a current and future potential global distribution map for this pest under climate change with MaxEnt software. We tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> by comparing its native niche in North America to its invasive niches on other continents using Principal components analyses (PCA) in R. The potentially suitable habitat for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> in its native and non-native ranges is presented in the present paper. The results suggested that the mean temperature of the wettest quarter and the mean temperature of the driest quarter are the most important environmental variables determining the potential distribution of 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic>. We found strong evidence for niche shifts in the realized climatic niche of this pest in South America and Australia due to niche unfilling; however, a niche shift in the realized climatic niche of this pest in Eurasian owing to niche expansion.
