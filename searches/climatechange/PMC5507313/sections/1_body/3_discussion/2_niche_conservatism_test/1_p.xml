<p class="p">The present study is first to compare the niche changes for the invasive species 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> across multiple continents. Our study provides strong evidence of niche shifts of between native and non-native range for this pest, which implies that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> has the potential to invade novel areas. Climatic niche shifts have been demonstrated in several invasive species, including plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Our results are in agreement with these previous studies in regard to climatic niche shifts. Here, all comparisons suggested that the niche of this pest had a low overlap. This indicates that their niche was adapted to different environmental conditions in the non-native range.
