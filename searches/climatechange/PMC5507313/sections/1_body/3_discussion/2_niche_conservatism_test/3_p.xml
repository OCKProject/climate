 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> in Eurasia exhibits very high niche expansion values (44.9% niche expansion, 35% niche unfilling). This suggests that species with narrower climatic niches in the native range show significantly higher rates of niche expansion in the alien range. Moreover, this result also shows that the distribution of this pest in Eurasia is not as strictly associated with climate as it is with host-plants, such as cotton. Cotton is one of this pestâ€™s most favored hosts. Pakistan, India and China are the important cotton-cultivating areas around the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], but it does not facilitate the understanding of the phenomenon in the current study. The current study focuses on different areas inhabited by only one species. South America is also an important cotton-producing area. Residence times are an another interpretation of niche expansion, as species may not have enough time to fill their potential niches [

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Thus, the residence time might be shorter in Eurasia than other continents. In other words, the time of introduction in may have been earlier in South America and Australia than in Eurasian.
