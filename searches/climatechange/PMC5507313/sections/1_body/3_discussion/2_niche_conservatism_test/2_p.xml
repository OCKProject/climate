<p class="p">The results also show that the niche shift in the realized niches of

 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> in Australia and South America are mainly due to niche unfilling, suggesting that dispersal barriers or interspecific interactions might be constraining this the pest to a narrower realized niche than is physiologically possible and moreover, also suggesting that this pest is still in a colonization phase in these two areas. Indeed, interspecific interaction, such as species displacement play an important role in the invasion of alien species [

On the other hand, the lack of species displacement between alien species and native species or other alien species in colony during initial establishment may have brought advantages to the alien species. If the expansion of invasive species is limited, it may be affected by species displacement.
