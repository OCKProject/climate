<p class="p">The cotton mealybug is native to North America and has already invaded to other continents around the world. The map of its predicted distribution suggests that climatic changes would affect the worldwide distribution of this invasive cotton mealybug. The model shows that there would be an expansion of highly and moderately suitable habitats in both native and invasive areas. The model predicted large amounts of suitable areas in terms of climate around the world outside of the native range. The occurrence of sub-suitable areas on the current distribution map of

 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> suggests that these areas were restricted by unappreciated biological conditions as a result of natural enemies, barriers to spread or local adaption. However, these areas are expected to changed over time with increasingly frequent human development and climate warming. This pest is already causing vast losses in cotton-producing areas of India [

Interestingly, our map suggests that the western of Australia contains have suitable habitat for this pest; however, only five distribution sites were recorded in eastern Australia in current papers. Therefore, strict quarantine measures are needed to be enforced across Australia for reduce the spread from the east of Australia. Essentially, the present study revealed that this pest may further damage the cotton production in other areas due to the climate change, including Australia, Uzbekistan and Cambodia. The potential distribution map of this pest will be beneficial in developing monitoring strategies to detect future infestations in currently uninfested regions.
