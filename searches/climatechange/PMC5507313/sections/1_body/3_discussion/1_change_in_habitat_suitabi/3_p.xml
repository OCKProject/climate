 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The male was unable to pupate, and the female having a comparatively very short life span, was unable to produce eggs when the temperature was above 40°C in a study of

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Our model suggested an increase in the population of this pest with a mean temperature of 22–37°C in the wettest quarter and a mean temperature of 8–19°C in the driest quarter as the favoured temperature range, which is also similar to the results of Fand and his colleagues [
