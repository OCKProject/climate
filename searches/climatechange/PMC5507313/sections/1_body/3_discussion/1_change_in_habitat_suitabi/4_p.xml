 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> were forecasted in current studies, but there are some factors that limit the accuracy of the prediction in our work. In current paper, the model only considered the abiotic factor which is climate variable, however, other biotic factors, such as host-plant availability. Cotton is one of the hosts of the pests, and their distribution seriously affects the distribution of pests. In addition, human-mediated transport for tourism or trade provides introduction route and therefore increase the risk of invasive species. Various reports suggested increases of biological invasions in accordance with the industrial revolution [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. we suggest that special quarantine measure should be taken to limit potential invade for suitable region for future infestations by human activities such as cultivation and agriculture product importation. Furthermore, biotic factors, such as interspecific interactions also affect the potential range of model [
