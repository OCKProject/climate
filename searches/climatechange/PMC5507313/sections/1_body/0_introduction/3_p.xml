<p class="p">Testing climatic niche conservatism and modelling habitat suitability under the scenario of climate change are necessary for developing strategies to limit the introduction as well as expansion of invasive species and to provide important ecological and evolutionary insights into species invasions [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Moreover, understanding the changes in species’ niches is not only a central topics in ecology and evolution but also is especially important in the study of biological invasions [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Many studies have suggested that climatic niche shifts are rare between the native and invasive range for numerous species [

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, some reports have shown that climatic niche shifts in invasive species are relatively frequent between European and North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Alien species survive under new climate conditions that are different from those in their native range owing to a lack of natural enemies or local adaptation when introduced into new geographic areas. Hence, testing niche changes between native and non-native ranges is crucial for understanding range expansion and the potential invasive range.
