<p class="p">The selected RCPs represent four possible greenhouse gas emission trajectories ranging from low (RCP2.6) to high (RCP8.5) corresponding to increases in global radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to preindustrial values (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 w/m

Because extreme climatic variations may have a greater influence on the geographical distribution pattern, we selected climate projections for simulation in four climate change scenario/year combinations: RCP 2.6–2050 (average for the years 2041–2060 under scenario RCP 2.6), RCP 8.5–2050 (average for the years 2041–2080 under the scenario RCP 8.5), RCP 2.6–2070 (average for the years 2061–2080 under the scenario RCP 2.6), and RCP 8.5–2070 (average for the years 2061–2080 under the scenario RCP 8.5), these data all provided the best representation for future climate. Future climate projection data were downloaded from the World Climate Database (
