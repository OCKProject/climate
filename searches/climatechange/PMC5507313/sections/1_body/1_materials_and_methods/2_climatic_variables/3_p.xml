<p class="p">Multicollinearity among predictor variables may hamper the analysis of species-environment relationships because ecologically more causal variables can be excluded from models if other correlated variables explain the variation in the response variable better in statistical terms [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Hence, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each pairwise comparison of all 19 climatic variables to identify and remove highly correlated variables (r≥|0.85|) (

Seven remaining predictor variables, best describing the availability of water and energy, were subsequently processed: mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (mean monthly maximum temperature—mean monthly minimum temperature)) (BIO2); Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (*100) (BIO3); Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter (BIO8); Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter (BIO9); Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15); Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18); Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (BIO19).
