<p class="p">The selection of MaxEnt was based on the following reasons: 1) MaxEnt requires presence-only data [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]; 2) compared to other approaches, MaxEnt is relatively better than other modelling software [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]; 3) MaxEnt has been found to be robust in modelling low numbers of occurrences [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. MaxEnt estimates the probability distribution of species presence by comparing the environmental conditions across known occurrences of the species from the target landscape or model background [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The parameters of MaxEnt are set as follows: linear, quadratic, product, threshold and hinge methods were used to generate the feature types. The logistic output was used in MaxEnt, which generates a continuous map with an estimated probability of presence between 0 and 1. A jackknife test was used to estimate the significance of the contribution of each variable to the model. The convergence threshold (10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>), maximum iterations (5000) and max number of background points (10000) were used to run the model. The MaxEnt model was created based on the 10-fold cross-validation method.
