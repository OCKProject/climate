 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], who used principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the environmental space of the investigative environmental variables into a two-dimensional space defined by the first and second principal components [
 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Then, the two-dimensional environmental space was projected onto a 100×100 PCA grid of cells bounded by the minimum and maximum PCA values in the background data. In this step, a kernel function was used to smooth the climatic space defined in the gridded PCA climatic spaces based on the first two PCs [

 <xref rid="pone.0180913.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. If the niche overlap value falls outside the 95% confidence interval of the null hypotheses, equivalency of the two niches can be rejected. For the similarity test, a 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value &gt;0.05 indicated that the niches were no more similar than expected by chance. The Schoener’s D metric was used to measure the niche overlap, which varies from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (overlap). Niche unfilling and niche expansion were also calculated to provide a more complete depiction of niche shifts. Niche expansion occurs when a species colonizes environmental conditions in its invaded range that could be occupied but are absent in its native range, while niche unfilling occurs when a species fails to colonize climates in the invaded range that are occupied in the native range.
