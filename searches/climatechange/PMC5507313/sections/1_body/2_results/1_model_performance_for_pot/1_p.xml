<p class="p">The model performance for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> was better than random, with a mean training AUC value of 0.942 (ranging from 0.927–0.948) and a test AUC value of 0.92 (ranging from 0.88–0.935) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180913.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>); therefore, the model performed well in predicting the suitable habitat area for the species. A “maximum training sensitivity plus specificity” threshold value of 0.272 was obtained from the 10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile training presence occurrence of the species. The relative contributions of each environmental variables to the MaxEnt model are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180913.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. BIO8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter) (29.8%) and BIO9 (mean temperature of driest quarter) (26%) were the most important environmental variables determining the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic>. These two factors could explain 55.8% of the model. However, BIO18 (Precipitation of Warmest Quarter) (4%) and BIO19 (Precipitation of Coldest Quarter) (9.6%) could contributed 13.6% of the model. It appeared that thermal condition were more important than other variables in creating the map of this pest. The suitable habit areas for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic> were reclassified into four levels: unsuitable habitat (&lt;0.272), low habitat suitability (0.272–0.400), moderate habitat suitability (moderate risk) (0.400–0.600), and highly habitat suitability (high invasion risk) (0.6–1.0).
