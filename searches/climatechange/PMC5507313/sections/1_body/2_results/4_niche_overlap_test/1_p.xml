 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180913.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Niche overlap between the native and non-native ranges of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsi</italic> was very low in all analyses. There was only 2% niche overlap between the native range and Eurasia (Schoener’s D = 0.02) and 9% between native range and Australia (Schoener’s D = 0.09). The results also show the native and South America as having only 8% niche overlap (Schoener’s D = 0.08). Niche unfilling was more prevalent than niche expansion except in the native vs. Eurasian comparison. In Australia, there was little evidence of the expansion of the species’ realized niche into climates that are available in the species’ native range (1.2%) and powerful evidence of niche unfilling (45.6%) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180913.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In South America, more than 39% of the species’ invaded niche exists in climates that are not occupied in its native range, and 62.4% of the species’ native niche remains unfilled. However, in the most important and broad areas of distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">solenopsis</italic>, Eurasian, there were stronger evidence of niche expansion (44.9%) and relatively weaker evidence of niche unfilling (35%). The null hypothesis of niche equivalency test was rejected for all comparisons between the native and invasive range. The results of the comparisons between the native and invasive areas indicate that this invasive species has undergone significant alterations to its environmental niche during the invasion process, as all niche equivalency was rejected. By contrast, the evaluation of niche similarity yielded no significant results from the two comparisons, which were the native range vs. South America and the native range vs. Eurasian, leading to non-rejection of the null hypotheses of niche similaritiy due to change. This result suggests that in both Eurasia and South America the occupation by this species does not follow the pattern expected by native niche requirements and seems to be random. However, the niche similarity tests showed that the niches of this pest in Australia are more similar to the niches in the native region than would be expected by chance.
