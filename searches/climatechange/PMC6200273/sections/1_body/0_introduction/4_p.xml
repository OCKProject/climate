<p class="p">Here, we sought to understand how drought modulates the effects of gradual climate change on the multidimensional structural stability of different plant communities and land-use practices. We focused our analysis on forest-grassland ecotone communities in the Alps, namely unmanaged forests, and managed and unmanaged grasslands. We use a landscape dynamic vegetation model (see Barros 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]) to reproduce the effects of three different drought regimes (in combination with gradual changes in climate in bioclimatic variables) on the stability of these plant communities in the Ã‰crins National Park (French Alps). This model simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of plant functional groups (PFGs) and their responses to both environmental and land-use changes. We then analysed and compared the resulting states of communities of PFGs with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-dimensional hypervolumes in order to account for the multi-facetted nature of biodiversity, instead of focusing on the responses of single community variables [

This approach allows investigation of how environmental change affects both taxonomic and functional diversity and assessment of the relative stability of different communities. As in other stability studies, we considered communities to be stable if, when disturbed, they showed small departures from their initial states, and when temporal variance was lower [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This meant that communities were deemed more stable when their initial and final hypervolumes were most similar. This framework captures structural community changes in their whole, while still allowing to analyse how they translate into taxonomic and functional changes. Hence, rather than providing quantitative predictions of drought effects on particular community properties, we analysed how extreme drought modulates the impact of climate change on the multidimensional stability of plant communities in Alpine forest-grassland ecotones, explicitly considering effects of the ecosystem type and land-use regime.
