<p class="p">However, communities are more than the simple sum of their species, and to better understand their stability we need to go beyond studying the responses of isolated community properties, like total biomass [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Instead, the responses of multiple facets of biodiversity (e.g. changes in taxonomic and functional structures and compositions) should provide a better image of the consequences of global change drivers for community stability [
