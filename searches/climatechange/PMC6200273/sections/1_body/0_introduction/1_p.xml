<p class="p">Climate change is expected to increase average temperatures, but also the frequency and intensity of drought events [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], changes in drought regimes have implications for plant community structure and composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Extreme droughts have already caused significant forest diebacks around the globe [
