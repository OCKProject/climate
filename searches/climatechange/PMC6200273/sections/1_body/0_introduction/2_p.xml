<p class="p">In the European Alps, forest-grassland ecotones at the treeline are sources of important ecosystems services [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Current treelines have resulted from centuries of agro-pastoral activities, whose abandonment causes forests to move upwards and encroach open grassland habitats [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The added effect of climate change further promotes this encroachment and causes the loss of suitable habitat for alpine grasslands at their lower range edges [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], as well as changes in taxonomic and functional diversity at the treeline itself [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. How changes in drought regimes will modulate these impacts, however, is still poorly known. Depending on its frequency, intensity and temporal extent, drought may impact forest-grassland ecotones differently [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and ultimately affect their stability. Simulation models suggest that drought can facilitate species adapted to warmer and drier climates, increasing woody encroachment at higher elevations over the short term, but cause forest expansion rates to slow down over the long term, when compared to climate and land-use changes alone [
