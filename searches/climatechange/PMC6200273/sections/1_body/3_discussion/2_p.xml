<p class="p">Despite there being more woody encroachment in managed grasslands (note the increase in tree relative abundance in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), they also appeared to be more stable than unmanaged grasslands, as mean PFG abundances changed less and became less variable. This was likely due to two things. First, grazing limited the species that could colonise managed grasslands, preventing large turnovers, but allowing an increase of young trees and seedlings that caused some woody encroachment. Second, unmanaged grasslands are situated at higher elevations (2736 m a.s.l. on average, across repetitions) where changes in abiotic conditions can easily destabilise communities by driving turnover towards more drought tolerant and warm-adapted species [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In fact, the loss of subalpine and alpine grassland species (like groups H1, H8 and H9) and the increases in the woody/non-woody ratio that we observed in grasslands have been indicated as impacts of climate change in field studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These shifts caused functional changes in grasslands, which may implicate lower total productivity, and lower fodder quantity and quality [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. For instance, experimental studies in subalpine grasslands also reported decreases in average SLA with drought, together with lower nutritive value of forage [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this case, functional changes were attributed to phenotypic plasticity, rather than turnover, and communities rapidly recovered after drought (see also [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]). Admittedly, FATE-HD does not reproduce intra-PFG variability; yet, prolonged and repeated drought events may degrade community recovery potential and cause longer-term changes, like the observed turnover, that are not visible during short-term studies [
