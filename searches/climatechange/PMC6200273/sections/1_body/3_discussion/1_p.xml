<p class="p">Climate change and extreme drought events will affect the stability of forest-grassland ecotone communities in the European Alps, even if land use remains unchanged. Gradual climate change was the main driver of long-term destabilisation of grassland and forest communities. Nevertheless, drought had strong short-term effects on communities, and its impacts on their long-term structure and composition depended on the type of community and land-use regime. For instance, frequent and severe drought offered a short-term advantage to woody PFGs in managed grasslands, but led them to be less encroached in the long term (

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]). Also, drought impacts on structural stability showed that forests were generally more stable than grasslands. Indeed, turnover of forest species (undergrowth or canopy) was more limited by biotic filtering, as new species needed to be shade tolerant. Slower phanerophyte dynamics (they grow slower, live longer and mature later) and their higher drought tolerances also contributed to forest stability, especially because established canopies reduced drought intensity and protected communities from extreme drought effects. Nevertheless, we still observed a shift to more drought tolerant forests. For instance, the more positive long-term effect of drought on late-successional and shade-tolerant PFGs like
