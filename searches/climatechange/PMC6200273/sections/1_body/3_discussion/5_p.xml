<p class="p">To conclude, our simulation study showed that drought may not reverse on-going impacts of gradual climate change in forest-grassland ecotones. Still, its impacts on final community structure will likely differ between forest and grasslands, as well as land-use regimes, and may impact the provisioning of ecosystem services in the European Alps. Notably, the hypervolumes framework allowed a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of distinct disturbances for the structural stability of distinct plant communities, with a direct interpretation of what they meant for biodiversity and, consequently, ecosystem services.</p>
