 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and individual community properties [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], we focused on multidimensional structural stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This way, we analysed community disturbances holistically, which not only is a simpler analysis from a methodological point of view–analysing changes many different community properties was not necessary–but is also a better representation of how biodiversity responds to disturbances. We recommend that future studies looking at how ecosystems respond to disturbances also consider changes in structural stability using multidimensional approaches like the hypervolumes framework, rather than following single properties that may not respond disturbance and falsely indicate the absence of change [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Importantly, the hypervolumes framework allows for cross-community and cross-scenario comparisons, which can be important in from a management perspective as limited resources often mean prioritising more sensitive communities for conservation efforts. Although here we used a simulation experiment, the framework can be applied to empirical data and to analyse changes in other ecosystem, or community components [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. For instance, space-for-time analyses can be done using treatment-type field experiments, provided that enough replicates are available in each treatment. The hypervolumes framework also allowed readily analysing which community entities (in this case PFGs) were most responsive to drought scenarios, and how this reverberated to changes in functional diversity. Because community functional trait values are tightly linked to ecosystem services [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], our results are thus highly relevant for ecosystem management in this region. At present, much of the management in the Écrins NP, and elsewhere in the European Alps, aims to prevent the loss of open habitats and associated biodiversity and ecosystem services [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] by subsidising traditional pastoral activities and preventing woody encroachment [

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Yet, shifts in forest structure and composition can have important repercussions for general biodiversity, and affect carbon and water cycles [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. For instance, the ‘eucalyptus dieback’ in Australia has been followed by sharp declines of avian fauna [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Forest dieback may also affect the carbon balance by decreasing carbon uptake through foliage and increase carbon emissions from stemwood decomposition (see review by [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]). Although we have not included forest management in our study, we can foresee that the combined impact of management, drought and gradual climate change on forest stability will largely depend on the type of management in terms of structural and composition diversity (e.g. lower overstory densities can decrease competition for water [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] species mixtures can increase resilience to drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]). Managing for high diversity of ecosystem services in forest-grassland ecotones will therefore require an assessment of the relative stability of grasslands and forests to global change drivers. This means that we need to understand impacts on both taxonomic and functional diversity, so that more resilient community structures and compositions can be promoted.
