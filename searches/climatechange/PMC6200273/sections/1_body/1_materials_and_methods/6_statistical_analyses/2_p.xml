<p class="p">The effect of different drought scenarios on hypervolume comparisons was assessed separately for each response variable (mean distance, size changes and overlap), by running analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with and without null comparisons (used as a control treatment). When null comparisons were included, we used Type III ANOVAs to account for the different sample sizes (n = 100 for null comparisons; n = 300 for drought scenario comparisons). Before calculating ANOVAs, we verified normality and homoscedasticity, and log-transformed response variables when necessary to ensure that these conditions were met. For a visual interpretation of results, we calculated the standardised effect sizes (SES) of the different drought scenarios with respect to the null comparisons, per community and management combination.</p>
