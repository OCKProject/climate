<p class="p">Since we did not simulate forest management, we did not have a fully crossed design. Hence, we divided our statistical analyses along two main questions: 1) do different drought regimes affect forests and grasslands differently (the effect of habitat)? And 2) do the effects of different drought regimes on grasslands depend on management regime (the effect of management)? To investigate the first question, managed grasslands were excluded from the analysis, and to investigate the second question forests were excluded from the analysis.</p>
