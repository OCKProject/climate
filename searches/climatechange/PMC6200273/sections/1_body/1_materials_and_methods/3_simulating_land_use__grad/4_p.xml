<p class="p">Drought events were simulated using maps of pixel-based drought intensity (
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic>) values, calculated as the lowest monthly values of moisture index (
 <italic class="italic">MI</italic>) in each year. Because 
 <italic class="italic">MI</italic> is measured as the difference in precipitation and evapotranspiration, negative 
 <italic class="italic">MI</italic> values indicate climatic drought conditions. Therefore, the lower the 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> value, the more severe the drought (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for formulae). We calculated 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps for ‘current’ and ‘future’ conditions. Current 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps were based on 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> values averaged across years 1961–1990 per pixel and were used to simulate “no drought years”. Future 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps were based on 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> predictions for 2080 (using climate projections following the A1B scenario), which we increased or decreased uniformly across the landscape to vary drought intensity. Future ‘moderate’ 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps corresponded to a 20% increase of 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> values relative to projections for 2080 (lower intensity), while future ‘severe’ 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps corresponded to 20% decrease of the projected values (higher intensity; Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s004" class="xref">S4 Appendix</xref>). Drought frequency was simulated by feeding future 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> maps more or less frequently to FATE-HD. We considered two levels of frequency ‘sporadic’ and ‘frequent’, which were combined with different intensities to simulate different drought scenarios (see below).
