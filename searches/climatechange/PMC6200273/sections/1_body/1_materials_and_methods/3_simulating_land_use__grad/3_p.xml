<p class="p">Gradual climate change is simulated as changes in habitat suitability, thus affecting seed production and recruitment. For each PFG, future habitat suitability maps were calculated based on the species distribution models described above, using future projections of the five bioclimatic variables as predictors (downscaled at 100 m resolution grid). For a direct comparison with results shown in Barros
