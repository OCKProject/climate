<p class="p">Land use is simulated in the form of mowing and grazing (the two most important agro-pastoral land-use activities in the park), which occur once a year in the areas that have been mapped in 2006 by the park managers. Mowing and grazing affect PFG survival or cause them to resprout, depending on a PFGâ€™s age class, size and palatability in the case of grazing. Mowing also removes all trees taller than 1.5m (second height stratum). Hence, binary maps of mown areas and areas grazed at low, medium and high intensities were fed into the model to simulate their presence/absence per pixel. We kept grazing and mowing activities constant throughout all simulation scenarios to simulate the land management of the park as of 2006.</p>
