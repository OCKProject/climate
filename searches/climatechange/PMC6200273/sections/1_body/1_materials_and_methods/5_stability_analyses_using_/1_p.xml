<p class="p">We focused our stability analysis on forest (unmanaged) and grassland (managed or unmanaged) communities present in the forest-grassland ecotone (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s002" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref> for community subsetting procedure). Hypervolumes of PFGs’ yearly relative abundances (averaged across the landscape) were used to represent the state of communities. We compared the current state (i.e. last 45 years of the initialisation phase at which quasi-equilibrium was reached; n = 10) with the future state of communities after different drought scenarios were applied (i.e. 50 years of stabilisation phase; n = 11). For null comparisons, we compared the current state with the future state of communities under ‘no change’ simulations (also using the 50 years of stabilisation phase; n = 11). Departures from average initial PFG abundances were measured as i) between-centroid distances (hereafter, mean distances) of initial and final state hypervolumes. Changes in the temporal variability of PFG abundances were measured ii) as differences in initial and final hypervolume sizes (size changes). Finally, iii) the overlap between initial and final state hypervolumes (overlap) provided an overall measure of community similarity, that compliments the other two metrics [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, the more distant centroids become, the larger the final hypervolume is and the less it overlaps with the initial hypervolume, the more unstable the analysed community was with respect to the analysed disturbance.
