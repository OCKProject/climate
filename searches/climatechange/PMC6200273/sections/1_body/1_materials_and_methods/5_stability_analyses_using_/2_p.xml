<p class="p">Before calculating and comparing the hypervolumes, we reduced the number of dimensions to three using Principal Components Analyses (PCA), and chose the ideal bandwidth size using a sensitivity analysis (0.15, see

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]). For each of the 27 pairs of current and future state hypervolumes (3 community-management combinations x 3 drought scenarios x 3 repetitions), we 1) calculated a PCA on the combined PFG relative abundances of each state; 2) extracted the factor scores from the first three principal components; 3) calculated the current and future states hypervolumes on the factor scores corresponding to these periods; and 4) compared the hypervolumes in terms of mean distance, size changes and overlap. Because hypervolume calculations rely on random sampling techniques, results can be influenced by small sample sizes [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. To account for this, steps 3 and 4 were repeated 100 times. For null comparisons, each of the 100 pairs of hypervolumes was only compared once, as ‘no change’ simulations were run 100 times.
