<p class="p">We simulated the effects of gradual climate change and drought regimes on the vegetation of the Écrins NP using the FATE-HD simulation platform. The implementation and parameterisation of FATE-HD is explained in detail in Boulangeat

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] (added drought effects). Therefore, we only give an overview here. Vegetation dynamics in FATE-HD are the result of the explicit simulation of the population dynamics, dispersal, biotic interactions (through interaction for light), and response to management (mowing and grazing) and abiotic conditions of 24 plant functional groups (PFGs) on an annual basis. These PFGs represent the ca. 400 dominant species present in the park, grouped by functional similarity and tolerance to abiotic and biotic conditions. The park’s surface (ca. 270 000 ha) was divided into 100x100m grid pixels. In a pixel, PFG population dynamics are dependent on PFG demographic parameters, their ability to tolerate shade and the pixel’s habitat suitability. The amount of shade depends on the size and abundance of PFGs, which can occupy up to 5 vertical strata (see Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>) depending on their maximum height. The taller and more abundant a PFG becomes, the more shade it casts on smaller PFGs. Habitat suitability affects seed production and recruitment, and was calculated for each PFG using a species distribution modelling approach (

 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]), with slope, percentage of calcareous soil and five bioclimatic variables as predictors (isothermality, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, mean temperature of coldest quarter and annual precipitation). Bioclimatic variables were averaged across 1961–1990 to calculate ‘current’ habitat suitability (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). Short- and long-distance seed dispersal connect pixels and their vegetation dynamics. Effective dispersal distances are conditional on the dispersal capacity of each PFG.
