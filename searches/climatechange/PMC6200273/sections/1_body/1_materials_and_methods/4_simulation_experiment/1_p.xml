<p class="p">We developed a simulation experiment with three extreme drought scenarios to test how drought influences gradual climate change effects on forests and grasslands under different management practices (Fig C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s004" class="xref">S4 Appendix</xref>). Simulations had three phases: initialisation, scenario and stabilisation. The initialisation phase was necessary to achieve the ‘current’ state of the vegetation (corresponding to the climate average across 1961–1990) and followed the procedure used and validated in Boulangeat
