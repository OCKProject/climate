<p class="p">The scenario phase started from the end of the initialisation, by applying one of three scenarios of drought to the ‘current’ vegetation (150 time-steps representing years 1991–2140): 
 <italic class="italic">‘no drought’</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">‘sporadic and moderate drought’</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">‘frequent and severe drought’</italic>. Our choice of drought scenarios was based on a previous fully-factorial experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0206138.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], from which we selected the most contrasting scenarios to put in evidence drought consequences for ecosystem stability. For the ‘
 <italic class="italic">no drought</italic>’ scenario the current 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> map (average 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> between 1961–1990) was fed to FATE-HD and kept until the end of the simulations; for the 
 <italic class="italic">‘sporadic and moderate drought’</italic> scenario the moderate 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> map (projected 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> for 2080, increased by 20%) was fed to FATE-HD every 16 time-steps (i.e. low drought frequency and intensity); and for the 
 <italic class="italic">‘frequent and severe drought’</italic> the severe 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> map (projected 
 <italic class="italic">Din</italic> for 2080, decreased by 20%) was fed to FATE-HD every time-step (i.e. high drought frequency and intensity). Because drought is unlikely to occur every year for decades, we introduced 10 no-drought time-steps between each sequence of 5 drought events. Drought events always started with climate change (time-step 15), but stopped between time-steps 90 and 105, depending on the frequency. All three scenarios included gradual climate change, which was simulated by changing habitat suitability maps between time-steps 15–90 of the scenario phase at every 15 time-steps (equivalent to 2005, 2020, 2035, 2050, 2065 and 2080). Unlike drought, climate warming was kept until the end of the simulations, by keeping the last habitat suitability map. We chose to stop drought while maintaining a warmer climate so that we could investigate how drought impacted the communities over the long term, even in the absence of further drought effects. Thus, after the scenario phase the model ran for an additional 50 time-steps to achieve quasi-equilibrium (stabilisation phase, representing the years 2141–2190) so that long term drought effects could be observed.
