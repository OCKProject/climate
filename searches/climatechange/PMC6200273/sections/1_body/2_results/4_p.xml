<p class="p">Unmanaged grasslands suffered mostly from the loss of groups characteristic of alpine environments, with subalpine and alpine herbaceous groups (like H1, H8 and H9) being replaced by more thermophilous and drought tolerant chamaephytes (C1) and herbs (H5; see Tables A and F in

Unlike in forests and managed grasslands, in unmanaged grasslands there were distinct impacts of drought scenarios on functional structure. In agreement with results shown by hypervolume metrics, frequent and severe drought caused smaller changes in the functional structure of unmanaged grasslands, mostly increasing community-averaged leaf area. Sporadic and moderate drought caused, in addition, decreases in light preference, while gradual climate change also led to decreases in moisture requirements (
