<p class="p">Notably, the long-term effects of different drought regimes depended on the type of community and land-use regime considered (Figs

Forests were overall more stable under drought and climate change than unmanaged grasslands, having shown smaller departures from mean abundances (i.e. shorter mean distances) and changing less in terms of overall community structure (i.e. larger overlaps; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), despite abundances becoming more variable in the future. Although differences between drought regimes were small, frequent and severe drought led to slightly more variable forests in the future (higher increases in size; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Being more stable, forests also showed relatively weak taxonomic changes when compared to grasslands, as all PFG eigenvector values were &lt;0.5 (

Nonetheless, riparian pioneer trees (P2), late successional deciduous trees (P3) and undergrowth groups (H4, H6 and H7) decreased in abundance, while thermophilous pioneers (P1), late successional trees (P5, P7), and drought tolerant shrubs and woody chamaephytes (C4 and C5, respectively) increased. This caused several functional changes at the community level. Forests suffered reductions in average specific leaf area (SLA) and community moisture requirements, while traits like dispersal distance, longevity, seed mass, maturity and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) increased. Interestingly, the added effect of drought did not impact taxonomic or functional changes already observed under gradual climate change (
