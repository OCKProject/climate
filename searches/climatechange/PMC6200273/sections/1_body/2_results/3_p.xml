<p class="p">Managed grasslands were also more stable to drought and climate change than their unmanaged counterparts, showing smaller departures from initial mean PFG abundances and varying less in the future, even if they appeared to change more in terms of community structure (i.e. smaller overlaps; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). In fact, smaller overlaps were likely caused by the considerable size reductions in future state hypervolumes (compare Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). Like in forests, changes in managed grasslands were qualitatively similar across drought scenarios, yet, quantitatively, frequent and severe drought led to smaller overall departures from the current state (note the smaller mean distances and larger overlaps, also present in unmanaged grasslands; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Taxonomic changes in managed grasslands, however, were similar across drought scenarios, being mostly driven by non-palatable and light-loving PFGs that are relatively abundant in these communities (see Tables A and F in
