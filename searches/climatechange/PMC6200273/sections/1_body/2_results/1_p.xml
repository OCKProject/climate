<p class="p">As a first step, we evaluated whether the effect of the drought scenarios and their interactions with type of community and land-use regime were significantly different from random variation, by comparing them to the set of ‘no change’ simulations (i.e. null comparisons). Variance between scenarios was significantly larger than within-scenario variance (Table E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>) and null comparisons had largely different values from drought scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). This confirmed that all scenarios significantly affected communities, yet differences between scenarios were less clear. Hence, we tested for the effects of drought scenarios by excluding ‘null comparisons’. Although climate change seemed to be the main driver of community destabilisation (i.e. ‘no drought’ effects were qualitatively similar to the effects of remaining drought scenarios; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206138.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), we still found significant differences between drought scenarios (Table F in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>), confirming that different drought scenarios had quantitatively different effects on the future state of communities. Like gradual climate change, drought led to significant changes in the mean and variance of relative PFG abundances (i.e. mean distance and size changes), as well as significant overall changes in community structure. Yet, the impacts of different drought regimes differed between forest and grassland communities, as well as land-use regimes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206138.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>). For instance, frequent and severe drought caused grassland community structure to change less (smaller mean distances and larger overlaps) than other drought scenarios, but it made forests become more variable (larger future hypervolume sizes,
