  <p class="p">Effects of different drought scenarios on tree transient dynamics and on community states represented by hypervolumes. Current (in black) and future (blue, yellow and red) state hypervolumes are shown with their centroids (in dark blue). Five PFGs with the largest absolute factor loadings on the first three principal components are shown in grey. Functional traits with highest correlations with PC1 (traits with absolute coordinate values ≥ 0.8) are shown in green. Trait vector coordinates were scaled by the corresponding trait vectors’ correlations with ordination axes (only traits with absolute coordinate values ≥ 0.8 on PC1 are shown). For visual clarity, only 300 random sampled points are shown per hypervolume.</p>
