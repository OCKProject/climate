<p class="p">Our case study demonstrates that even the most common plants in the Midwestern region of the U.S. are vulnerable to climate change and that we have a rapidly shrinking time window to understand how to conserve and restore these critical ecosystems. The decline in suitability for native perennial grasses such as [
 <italic class="italic">A. gerardii</italic> (Big bluestem), 
 <italic class="italic">S. scoparium</italic> (Little bluestem), and 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> (Indian grass)] under both scenarios is particularly troubling. If significant changes are projected for even the most common species, the implications of climate change mean that there could be state transitions in the plant and animal communities associated with Midwestern grasslands in the coming decades (Briske et al.,
