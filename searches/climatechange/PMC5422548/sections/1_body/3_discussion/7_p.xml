<p class="p">In addition to thinking about seed mixes for restoration and the potential survival of particular plant species, adjustments to grassland management practices may be in order. For example, if conditions are getting hotter and drier, current fire, and grazing management practices may have different effects on the plant communities than they have had in the past. Similarly, changing precipitation regimes may influence biomass production. As such, it may be appropriate to lengthen the fire-return interval, change the timing of burning, and/or modify stocking rates on grazed grasslands (e.g., Holechek et al.,
