<p class="p">Our analysis was not extensive enough to make broad generalizations among plant photosynthetic pathways given the limited number of species and C3 and C4 graminoids that both exhibit similar suitability responses across models [i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Dichanthelium</italic> species (panic grass) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> (Indian grass)]. Similarly, broad generalizations regarding functional group responses are difficult because different species within a functional group display both positive and negative suitability responses across models. No clear trend for the responses of invasive species was evident either. However, we can provide some insights based on the species we did examine. We included two woody species 
 <italic class="italic">Maclura pomifera</italic> (osage orange) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. orbiculatus</italic> (Buckbrush). Both species show declines, but the decline of 
 <italic class="italic">M. pomifera</italic>, a tree species, is more dramatic than that for 
 <italic class="italic">S. orbiculatus</italic>, a shrub species, particularly under Model A2. Similarly, we only examined one invasive species 
 <italic class="italic">Schedonorus arundinacea</italic> (tall fescue), which is a grass frequently planted to pastures in the region. Habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">S. arundinacea</italic> drops to zero in both models and both time periods. A reduction in the cover of an invasive grass species may be considered a potential benefit by managers. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">T. radicans</italic> (poison ivy) is not an exotic species, but it is a vine-forming species that can cause an itchy rash after skin contact. The predicted decline in habitat suitability, particularly under Scenario A1B, would be considered a potential benefit by many land managers.
