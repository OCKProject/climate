<p class="p">Given the results that we obtained, some specific recommendations for this study region can be made. Dominant grasses in the tallgrass prairie region include [
 <italic class="italic">A. gerardii</italic> (Big bluestem), 
 <italic class="italic">S. scoparium</italic> (Little bluestem), and 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> (Indian grass)]. Of these three species, 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> is the species that has the highest habitat suitability across all of the scenarios in the future, so it may be wise for managers to consider increasing the proportion of this species in future plantings. Dominant forbs (flowering plants) native to tallgrass prairies that we evaluated here include species such as 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> (common yarrow), 
 <italic class="italic">Monarda fistulosa</italic> (wild bergamot), 
 <italic class="italic">Ratibida pinnata</italic> (gray headed coneflower), and 
 <italic class="italic">Potentilla simplex</italic> (common cinquefoil). Of these flowering plants, 
 <italic class="italic">A. millefolium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. simplex</italic> are the two species that have the highest habitat suitability in the future and might similarly be considered as good candidates to increase in future seed mixtures. Using this example as a model, managers of other grasslands could use a similar approach to revise the prescriptions used for restoration seed mixes.
