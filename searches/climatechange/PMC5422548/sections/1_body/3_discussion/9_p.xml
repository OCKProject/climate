<p class="p">Nonetheless, the outcomes from our modeling example provide a sobering perspective relative to long term sustainability of grasslands in the central portion of North America. Ecologists and managers will indeed need to add this new filter of regional habitat suitability under climate change as they manage for the future. Because large-scale grassland restorations are often costly endeavors, both in terms of human time and financial investments, ecologists will need to know whether they can expect restorations to be successful under future climatic conditions. We have thus developed the following recommendations:

   <p class="p">To ensure resilience in the face of climate change, take a proactive perspective to restoring grasslands, thinking about which species are expected to do well in the future and what geographic regions will be expected to provide suitable growing conditions. It would also be prudent to take a larger geographic perspective when thinking about restoration of particular communities. Model results could be used to triage restoration efforts toward both species and locations that are most likely to provide future habitat.</p>

   <p class="p">Adjustments to management practices may be in order. Fire and grazing management practices may have different effects on the plant communities than they have had in the past and changing climatic patterns may influence ecosystem responses to disturbance. The effects of such changes should be considered when evaluating how grasslands respond to management.</p>
