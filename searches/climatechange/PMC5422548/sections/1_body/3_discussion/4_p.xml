<p class="p">The reduction of some of the plant species in this Midwestern U.S. example could have important implications for pollinator species and other wildlife. For example, three common species, 
 <italic class="italic">S. orbiculatus</italic> (Buckbrush), and 
 <italic class="italic">V. baldwinii</italic> (Baldwin's ironweed) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. tenuifolium</italic> (Slender mountain mint) are expected to decline in habitat suitability under 2040 projected models. Both slender mountain mint and Baldwin's ironweed are important nectar sources for pollinators (Kopper et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>), so a decline in the abundance of these species could cascade across other taxa such as butterflies and bees. Similarly, Buckbrush is one of the most common shrubs in these prairies, providing nesting habitat for some grassland birds and browse for deer (Soper et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Holechek, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Coppedge, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Declines in Buckbrush could thus have important effects on birds and wildlife. The predicted decline in Buckbrush is also surprising because it is resilient to regular disturbance such as fire, even during periods of extreme drought like 2012 (Scasta et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). We should note that in some of these cases species showed declines in habitat suitability in 2040 followed by increases in habitat suitability in 2080. It is essential to note that in a real world scenario, if populations decline in 2040, they may not be resilient enough to increase by 2080.
