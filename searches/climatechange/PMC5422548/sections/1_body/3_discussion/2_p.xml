<p class="p">The A1b and A2 scenarios delivered different results. We believe these differences are driven by a decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) of our study region. In the current scenario, the isothermality values indicate that the DTR and the annual temperature range were about even. In the 2040 A2 scenario the isothermality values plunged, indicating that the DTR decreased below the annual temperature range. These changes in DTR can directly affect photosynthesis, respiration, growth and tissue restoration in plants (Hughes,
