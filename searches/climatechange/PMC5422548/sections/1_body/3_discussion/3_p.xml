<p class="p">Because these projected changes have ramifications for agriculture, conservation, and society in general, our results imply that it is imperative that future land management in this region incorporate climate variability as a driver of plant communities (Scasta and Rector, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Current national and regional frameworks for land management have very few ecological site descriptions (ESD's) and state-and-transition models that include climate change (Twidwell et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). It also begs the question of how resilient we should expect grasslands to be in other parts of the world where seed sources, precipitation, and soil quality are more limiting.
