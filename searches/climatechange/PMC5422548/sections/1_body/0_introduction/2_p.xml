<p class="p">In the recent past, the goal in restoring an ecosystem was defined by baseline conditions (i.e., prior to human settlement) that generally included the species that had existed in the region historically (Hobbs and Norton, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>). Once an ecosystem was restored, it was expected that, if the system was resilient, it could potentially stay in that state for decades or more (i.e., steady state). However, the threat of climate change has added a new complication. We can no longer simply replace the plant community that previously existed under historical conditions and assume that it will be successful. In the face of current knowledge about how ecosystems across the globe are changing with climate change (Field et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), ecologists now need an additional filter through which they must evaluate potential success. That is the filter of resilience to future climatic variation and future climatic change and anticipating species losses before they occur.
