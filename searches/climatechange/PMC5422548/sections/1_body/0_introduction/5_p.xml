<p class="p">Here, we use a case study of grassland restoration in the central part of the U.S. (Miller et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) to provide an example of how grassland restoration can be accomplished in a way that is resilient to climate change. We hypothesized that vegetation responses to forecasted climate change would be variable among photosynthetic pathways and plant functional group types and that by quantifying this variation recommendations for plant species selection and restoration can be guided by our modeling. We start with a suite of plant species known to exist in present grasslands and reconciled with field data. We then apply a fine scale climate model to this region, and evaluate the habitat suitability for each of these plant species under future conditions. This allows us to summarize which species will be most successful under future climate conditions and which species will not. This case study demonstrates the additional new planning step that will be needed to ensure successful long-term restoration of native grassland plant communities.
