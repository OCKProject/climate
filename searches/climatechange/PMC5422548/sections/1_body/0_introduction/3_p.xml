<p class="p">The Midwestern part of the United States is a place where grassland conversion has been extensive historically, even in the recent decade. Between 2006 and 2011, nearly 530,000 hectares (1.3 million acres) of grassland in the Western Corn Belt (WCB) were converted to cropland (Wright and Wimberly, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) for corn and soybean production. In response to this habitat loss and fragmentation, many grassland species are in decline (Jackson, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). As a result, there is also quite a bit of interest by natural resource managers in restoring and reconstructing grasslands.
