<p class="p">The effects of climate change will potentially exacerbate the loss and fragmentation of grasslands. Global climate change models predict that future climate in the U.S. Midwest is expected to become highly variable (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). The pattern of precipitation over the next few decades is forecast to come in the form of large downpours, which translates into a higher likelihood of flooding, and increased intervals of drought between precipitation events (Meehl and Tebaldi, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are a threat to the biodiversity, the stability of grassland native plant communities (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Hampe and Petit, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) and the goods and services that grasslands provide (Adger et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Stern, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The inevitable consequence of changing species distributions and environmental alterations through climate and land use change, will be a higher proportion of “novel” or “emerging systems” (Harris et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Root and Schneider, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hobbs et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), which will have significant implications for restoration and management practices.
