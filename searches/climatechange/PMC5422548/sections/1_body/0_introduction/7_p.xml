<p class="p">We predicted habitat suitability responses to climate change for 33 species of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and woody species of the Midwestern tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Our objectives were to (1) develop models that estimate the relative suitability of habitat occupied currently by these species, (2) utilize these models to project change in the suitability of habitat, and (3) evaluate how these results might affect a manager's perspective on restoration within this ecosystem. We modeled responses at two time frames using climate change scenarios which differ dramatically in their predicted CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. The larger goal of presenting this case study was to demonstrate the use of such downscaling techniques so that they could be applied in other grasslands worldwide.
