<p class="p">About one quarter of the Earth's terrestrial surface is covered by grasslands, and these are some of the most highly productive ecosystems in the world (Ramankutty and Foley, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Bond, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). The inherent productivity of grassland soils has resulted in the conversion of large expanses of grassland to row crop agriculture (Hill and Olson, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wright and Wimberly, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Woodland encroachment (Van Auken, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Archer et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Knapp et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and urban expansion create additional threats (Kerns et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The combination of such threats has relegated grassland ecosystem as one of the most endangered ecosystems in the U.S. (Noss et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Samson et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>). The ecological, sociological, and economic effects of grassland loss include threats to biodiversity (Lamarque et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ratajczak et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), losses in the suite of potential ways humans can interact with the landscape (Zheng et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), increased erosion, and a limited suite of economic land use options. While grasslands can be restored, particularly in places where soil is productive and native seeds can be collected and grown, the cost of restoration is often prohibitive. In some cases, removal of existing vegetation via herbicide or plowing is necessary prior to the reseeding. After establishment, management of grassland via fire and herbivores may be required to maintain the structure and composition of the native grassland (Fuhlendorf and Engle, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>).
