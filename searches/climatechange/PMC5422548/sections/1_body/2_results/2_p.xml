<p class="p">Models based on the A1B scenario show that by both 2040 and 2080 only 10% or less of currently available habitat will be suitable in the Grand River Grassland for many plant species (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). The few species with relatively high habitat suitability in 2040 such as 
 <italic class="italic">Dicanthelium</italic> spp. (panic grass), 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> (Indian grass), and 
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium repens</italic> (white clover) are predicted to undergo a substantial decrease to their habitat suitability by 2080. The only species that shows high habitat suitability from in 2080 is 
 <italic class="italic">Vernonia baldwinii</italic> (Baldwin's ironweed).
