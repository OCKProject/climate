<p class="p">As with most climate change projection studies, model projections depend greatly on simulations of future climate, GHG emission levels, and species dispersal scenarios (Bakkenes et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Our models were made using the IPCC global emissions climate scenarios A1B and A2. The A1B scenario predicts a temperature increase of as much as 5°C between the years 2040 and 2080 whereas the A2 scenario predicts a 3.4°C temperature increase but larger changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (increases by much as 7 gigatons of carbon/year between 2040 and 2080). In addition, the variable isothermality made the greatest contribution to our Maxent model. Isothermality quantifies the range between the day-to-night temperature oscillation and summer to winter oscillation. We found that the values of isothermaility in the A1B scenario decreased by a factor of 84% in both the 2040 and 2080 climate scenarios in comparison to the current scenario. This was not observed in the A2 scenario. Annual precipitation increased in both scenarios from the year 2012. Annual precipitation in the A1b scenario increased by 70 mm in 2040 and by 79 mm in 2080. Under the A2 scenario precipitation increased by 92 mm of precipitation per year (2040 and 2080). The A1B scenario was the most severe, predicting very low values of habitat suitability and low variation in these values across species in both time periods (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>). The A2 scenario predicted higher habitat suitability scores and more variation in those scores among the species for both time periods. However, both models predict the majority of species will experience declines in habitat by 2040. Projections to 2080 show that suitable habitat may only be available for a small subset (~12%) of the 33 species considered here (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>). We have provided a view of habitat suitability for two examples of common forbs,
