<p class="p">Models run using the A2 scenario showed that only four plant species [
 <italic class="italic">P. tenuifolium</italic> (Slender mountain mint), 
 <italic class="italic">Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</italic> (Buckbrush), 
 <italic class="italic">Toxicodendron radicans</italic> (Poison ivy), and 
 <italic class="italic">V. baldwinii</italic> (Baldwin's ironweed)] are expected to experience declines in habitat suitability by 2040 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>, see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref> as an example and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>), but then show increases in habitat suitability between 2040 and 2080. Given that species have to pass through low habitat suitability conditions in 2040 to get to higher 2080 suitability conditions it is possible that they may not have the chance to recover. Ten species (four warm-season grasses, two cool-season grasses, and four forbs) show no change in habitat suitability by 2040 but suitability will decline substantially by 2080 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S3</xref>). Of particular note relative to Midwestern grassland restorations is that perennial grasses [
 <italic class="italic">A. gerardii</italic> (Big bluestem), 
 <italic class="italic">S. scoparium</italic> (Little bluestem), 
 <italic class="italic">S. nutans</italic> (Indian grass), and 
 <italic class="italic">Sporobolus clandestinus</italic> (Rough dropseed)] show a much more dramatic reduction in habitat suitability between the two time periods. And similarly, relative to current conservation issues related to monarch butterfly (
 <italic class="italic">Danaus plexippus</italic>) restoration, even common milkweed, 
 <italic class="italic">Asclepias syriaca</italic>, suffers low habitat suitability by 2080. For all other species, suitable habitat begins to decline by 2040 and continues to decline by 2080 (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S4</xref>).
