<p class="p">We modeled species current and future distributions using the maximum entropy model Maxent version 3.3.3 k (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Phillips and Dudík, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Maxent is considered a presence-background modeling technique because it does not require the use of absence data and it incorporates information on environmental variation across the study area (aka “background data”) during model development. Maxent has been compared to other presence-only methods and is regarded as the most reliable and robust (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hernandez et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Wisz et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). This technique is also particularly effective when species sample sizes are small. Maxent uses occurrence data and environmental variables at those occurrence points to create distributional models. The environmental variables or features impose constraints on the unknown distribution so the mean of each feature is required to be within some error bounds of the empirical average over the presence sites. The constraints are relaxed using regularization parameters. Regularization prevents Maxent from “overfitting” occurrence points to environmental variables in order to avoid negative effects on predictive performance (Hastie et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). Models that are over-fit fail to predict independent evaluation data and transferability to another region or time period (Phillips and Dudík, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Maxent approximates an unknown distribution using the known occurrences and background points and among all distributions satisfying the constraints, chooses the one of maximum entropy, or the most unconstrained one (Jaynes, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1957</xref>). In our study, the known distribution maps were developed for each species based on points/grid cell values across the 99 counties within the state of Iowa.
