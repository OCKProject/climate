<p class="p">For each species, we modeled the current distribution and then projected it onto two sets of future time periods (2040 and 2080) and two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). We increased the level of regularization for each species to two (from a default setting of 1), as doing so alleviates overfitting when sample sizes are small and greatly increases model performance and model transferability to future climates (Dudík et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Anderson and Gonzalez, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Radosavljevic and Anderson, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). To ensure that our models did not extrapolate beyond the environmental envelop of the occurrence data used in model development, we ran the Maxent model using the default “clamping” option to generate mapping predictions which treat variables outside the training ranges as if they were at the end of their training range (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The “donotextrapolate” option was also used as this sets predictions to zero whenever variables are outside of the training range. Lastly, we selected the logistic output format, which yields continuous values that indicate relative environmental suitability for the species (Phillips and Dudík, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). These values range from 0 (low probability of presence) to 1 (high probability of presence). Because we were modeling the future distributions within a relatively small geographic region (the Grand River Grasslands), we built our current distribution models using occurrence points from across all of Iowa to increase background data and ensure a broader representation of environmental conditions.
