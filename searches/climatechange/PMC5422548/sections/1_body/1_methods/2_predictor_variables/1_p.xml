<p class="p">We chose six predictor variables: temperature seasonality (represents seasonal variation in temperature), annual precipitation, precipitation of driest quarter, precipitation of the driest month, isothermality [mean diurnal range in temperature/(maximum temperature of warmest month—minimum temperature of coldest month)], and precipitation of wettest quarter. We chose these variables because they influence growth and survival patterns of plant species (Woodward, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>; O'Donnell et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) and because these predictor variables were uncorrelated as Pearson correlations were &lt;0.75 (Booth et al.,

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) were used for model simulation. Future climate scenarios were obtained from the Delta Method—a downscaling method based on thin plate spline spatial interpolation of anomalies (deltas) of original Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs (Hijmans et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). We compared species responses under two climate scenarios (A1B and A2). The A1B scenario predicts a linear increase in temperature from 1.4 to 6.4°C, and CO
