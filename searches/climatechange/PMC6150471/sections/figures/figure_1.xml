  <p class="p">Impact of RCP8.5 climate change on global mortality for individual models and the multi-model average. Estimates are for 2030 and 2100 for (a) ozone respiratory mortality (9 models) and (b) PM2.5 IHD+STROKE+COPD+LC mortality (5 models). PM2.5 is calculated as a sum of species. Uncertainty for each model is the 95% CI taking into account uncertainty in RR. Uncertainty for the multi-model average is the 95% CI including uncertainty in RR and across models.</p>
