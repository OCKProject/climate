 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2a</xref>). The effect on ozone mortality in 2100 is greatest in East Asia (45,600 deaths yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 41 deaths yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per million people), India (16,000 deaths yr

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per million people) and North America (9,830 deaths yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 13 deaths yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per million people), but some areas within these and other regions show decreases in mortality. East Asia has high mortality effects per person in part because of its higher projected mortality rate from respiratory diseases. Climate change contributes 14% of the overall increase in ozone mortality estimated for RCP8.5 in 2100 relative to 2000

 </sup>. However, three of 8 models in 2030 and three of 9 in 2100 show global decreases in ozone mortality due to climate change. For each model, the uncertainty range does not include zero; only the spread of models causes the overall uncertainty to span zero. Uncertainty in modeled ozone concentrations contributes over 97% to the overall uncertainty in both 2030 and 2100, with the remainder from uncertainties in relative risk (RR). Results from a sensitivity analysis using present-day population and baseline mortality rates (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) show 32% and 67% lower mortality estimates in 2030 and 2100, respectively, largely because the projected baseline mortality rates of chronic respiratory diseases increase through 2100. The models agree that ozone will increase due to climate change in some polluted regions, notably the northeast US as found in other studies
