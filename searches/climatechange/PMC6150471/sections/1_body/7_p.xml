 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> species except sea salt, in 2100, likely due to projected concentration decreases over densely-populated eastern China. Models also differ strongly in the sign and magnitude of changes in dust, particularly over North Africa and the Middle East; HadGEM2 projects increases in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> for all species except dust, but a strong decrease in dust over the Middle East and South Asia. In Africa, the decrease in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> near the equator is likely caused by increased precipitation, whereas PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> increases are associated with precipitation decreases in Southern Africa

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> (and ozone) responses to climate change among models likely result from differences in large-scale meteorological changes, and different treatments of atmospheric chemistry and feedback processes among the models (such as the response of dust to climate change).
