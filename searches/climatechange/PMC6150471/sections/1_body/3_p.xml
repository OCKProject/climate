 </sup>. Here we present results from additional ACCMIP simulations that were designed to isolate the influences of future climate change under RCP8.5, by simulating the projected climates of 2030 and 2100 (imposed by prescribing sea-surface temperatures, sea ice cover, and greenhouse gas concentrations for radiation) together with air pollutant emissions from 2000. The effects of climate change are then isolated by a difference with historical 2000 simulations. Premature mortality attributable to RCP8.5 climate change is estimated following the methods of Silva et al.
