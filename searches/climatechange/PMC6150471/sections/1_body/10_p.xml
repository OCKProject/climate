<p id="P11" class="p">Despite these uncertainties, this study is the first to use a multi-model ensemble to show that global air pollution-related mortality attributable to climate change is likely positive. The spread of results among models within the ensemble, including differences in the sign of global and regional mortality estimates, suggests that results from studies using a single model and a small number of model years should be interpreted cautiously. Actions to mitigate climate change, such as reductions in long-lived GHG emissions, will likely benefit human health by reducing the effect of climate change on air quality in many locations. These health benefits are likely to be smaller than those from reducing co-emitted air pollutants
