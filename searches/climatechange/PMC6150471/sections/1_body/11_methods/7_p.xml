<p id="P18" class="p">Overall uncertainty in mortality estimates includes uncertainty from the RRs and from air pollutant concentrations. First, we conduct 1000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations separately for each model-year to propagate uncertainty from the RRs to mortality estimates. For ozone, we use the 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for RR reported by Jerrett

 </sup> for 1000 MC simulations. Then, we calculate the average and 95% CI for the pooled results of the 1000 MC simulations for each model to quantify the spread of model results. We do not include uncertainties associated with population and baseline mortality rates, since these are not reported. As ACCMIP models used the same anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions, we do not consider uncertainty in emissions inventories, however we acknowledge that this is an important source of uncertainty, especially in particular regions

 </sup>. Our mortality estimates are affected by our choices of and underlying assumptions regarding concentration-response functions, population, and baseline mortality rates. Although a number of factors, such as vulnerability of the exposed population and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> composition, vary spatially and possibly temporally, we assume that the RRs estimated for the present day apply on a global scale and in future time periods. Also, our assumption that the spatial distribution of population within each country is constant in the future likely understates the effects of rural-to-urban migration, which is currently underway and expected to continue. However, the effects of climate change on air pollutant concentrations may be somewhat spatially uniform (as opposed to changes in emissions), and the coarse grid resolution of global models would not resolve air pollutant concentrations well in urban areas.
