<p id="P14" class="p">Seven of the nine models with Em2000Cl2030/2100 simulations reported both hourly and monthly ozone concentrations, while two reported only monthly values. We calculate the ratio of the 6-month average of daily 1-hr maximum concentrations to the annual average concentrations, for each grid cell and each year, for those models that reported both hourly and monthly concentrations; then, we apply that ratio to the annual average ozone concentrations for the other two models, following Silva
