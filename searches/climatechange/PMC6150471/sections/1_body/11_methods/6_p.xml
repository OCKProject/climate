 </sup>. Using country-level projections per age group, we mapped and gridded to the 0.5°×0.5° grid assuming that the present-day spatial distribution of total population within each country is unchanged in the future, as well as the present-day ratio of baseline mortality for the specific causes included in the epidemiological studies and for three disease groups projected in IFs (chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms). We select population projections from IFs instead of those underlying RCP8.5 to ensure consistency between projections of population and baseline mortality, since the latter are not available for RCP8.5, and for consistency with Silva

Had we used projections of population underlying RCP8.5, we would have likely estimated greater changes in premature mortality relative to 2000. IFs projections of baseline mortality rates reflect an aging population and regional demographic changes, showing a steep rise in chronic respiratory diseases (roughly tripling globally by 2100), particularly in East Asia and India, some regional increases in cardiovascular diseases (e.g. Middle East, Africa), and global decreases in lung cancer.
