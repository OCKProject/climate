<p id="P2" class="p">Climate change can affect air quality through several pathways, including changes in the ventilation and dilution of air pollutants, photochemical reaction rates, removal processes, stratosphereâˆ’troposphere exchange of ozone, wildfires, and natural biogenic and lightning emissions

 </sup>. Overall, changes in these processes are expected to increase ozone in polluted regions during the warm season, especially in urban areas and during pollution episodes, but decrease ozone in remote regions due to greater water vapour concentrations leading to greater ozone destruction. These effects are exacerbated by the greater decomposition of reservoir species such as PAN
