<p class="p">Model robustness was evaluated using partial ROC statistics [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which avoid many of the problems with traditional ROC approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We used the partialROC function in the ENMGadgets package in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and the 50% subset of available occurrence data described above. A further evaluation of our model was based on independent data from recent outbreaks reported to FAO EMPRES-i. These data represent outbreaks reported between December 2014 and September 2015; that is, the evaluation data come from the year following the temporal span of the data used for model calibration. We used a one-tailed cumulative binomial probability distribution that assessed the probability of obtaining the observed level of correct prediction by a chance alone, given the background expectation of correct predictions based on the proportional coverage of the region by the thresholded model prediction.
