<p class="p">To characterize current global climates, we used data available from the WorldClim archive (

For future conditions, we obtained data based on GCM outputs for 2050. These data comprised four RCPs spanning broadly different emissions scenarios into the future. Our future-climate projections thus summarized 62 combinations (
