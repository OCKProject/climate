<p class="p">Finally, we tested the similarity of estimated niches between BTV and vector species, taking into account the background similarity between the accessible areas of each [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150489.s005" class="xref">S5 File</xref>). Hence, present-day environmental conditions occupied by BTV and its vectors were not demonstrably different, and we found no indication of unlinked transmission and vector occurrence.
