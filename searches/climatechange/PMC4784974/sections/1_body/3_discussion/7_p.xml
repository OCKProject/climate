<p class="p">Finally, our models offered an interesting perspective on vector associations of BTV infections around the world. The BTV transmission cycle includes hosting by ruminants and vectors that transmit virus between hosts. Major knowledge gaps include the broader host distribution of BTV in diverse livestock hosts, and the vanishingly few studies that have focused on vector competence of different species of

 <italic class="italic">imicola</italic> in the Old World,

 <italic class="italic">insignis</italic> in North and South America,

 <italic class="italic">occidentalis</italic> in southern United States and Central America, and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">brevitarsis</italic> in Australia. We tested niche similarity between each vector and BTV distribution across the accessible region for the corresponding vector; we could not reject the null hypothesis in any case, so vector populations and BTV appear to share similar ecological niches. This observation is important because (1) vector populations can assist in identifying the potential distribution of the BTV in countries where the disease is not reported dependably to authorities, and (2) vector populations may drive BTV response to climate change [
