 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], including to more northern parts of Europe, in 1998 [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The expansion and the potential for susceptibility of new vector species to the virus raises concerns of broader BTV spread [

 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. BTV is transmitted by several vector species: 
 <italic class="italic">Culicoides imicola</italic> Kieffer, 1913 (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the most significant vector in the Old World [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], but three other species serve as vectors in the United Sates alone [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The distribution and movement of hosts has also been identified as a limiting factor for BTV spread; although BTV is known to have infected several ruminants, cattle and sheep are identified as primary reservoirs in several endemic areas worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The combination of climate, presence of susceptible host, and presence of competent vectors marks areas where BTV can circulate in the long term among livestock.
