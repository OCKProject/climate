<p class="p">The main effects of 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic>, significant across all of these models, suggest that among Independents (
 <italic class="italic">party</italic> = 0) the odds of belief in anthropogenic climate change increase by 20 to 25% (are multiplied by 1.202 to 1.249) with each step in 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic>. Significant 
 <italic class="italic">education×party</italic> interactions, however, indicate that the effects of education change with political party. Like the main effects of 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic>, the magnitude of 
 <italic class="italic">education×party</italic> interactions is roughly consistent (odds ratios from 0.748 to 0.850) across different datasets. Adjusted marginal plots in 
 <xref rid="pone.0138208.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> visualize the significant interactions in terms of probability. Among Democrats and Independents, probability of a now/human response rises with education. Among Republicans, however, this probability slightly declines with education. Better-educated Democrats and Republicans thus stand farther apart.
