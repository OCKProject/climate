 <xref rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> include respondent 
 <italic class="italic">age</italic> (in years), 
 <italic class="italic">gender</italic> (0 male, 1 female),

 <italic class="italic">party</italic> (–1 Democrat, 0 Independent, 1 Republican). Under this coding, when 
 <italic class="italic">education×party</italic> interaction terms are present the main effects of 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic> represent its effects when 
 <italic class="italic">party</italic> = 0 (Independents). Similarly the main effects of
