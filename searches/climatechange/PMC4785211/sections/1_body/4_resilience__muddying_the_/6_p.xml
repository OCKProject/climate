<p class="p">With respect to scale, natural resource management has generally been a species-centric undertaking, within relatively small management units (&lt;1 million hectares) and over short time periods (years to decade) (Groves et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>), whereas some recent definitions of resilience focus on ecological processes and functions at much larger (sub-continental) spatial scales and multi-decadal to centennial temporal scales (Zavaleta and Chapin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2010</xref>). While management focus on ecological processes and functions across larger landscapes is necessarily increasing, management at the species level still predominates and is required in many circumstances, such as for endangered and culturally significant species. We doubt many local managers or stakeholders would consider a strategy that enables current species within an area established in part for their protection to migrate out and a new suite of species to colonize the area as achieving resilience.
