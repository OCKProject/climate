<p class="p">This last idea (Milly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2008</xref>) deserves further thought. Climate is a fundamental driver of ecological processes and species distribution and abundance patterns on the landscape. Recent human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, long residence times of these gases in the atmosphere, and our current emissions trajectory suggest that the magnitude of future climate change will be substantial (Wigley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2005</xref>; Peters et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hansen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>) and thus ecological processes and species patterns will change significantly. Furthermore, anthropogenic climate change is not an episodic disturbance after which conditions return to a previous state; it is a combination of directional shifts in baseline conditions (e.g., increasing mean temperatures) and changes in extreme events (e.g., more frequent and intense storms and droughts). Viewed from a paleoecological perspective, the North American landscape has changed continuously with changes in climate (Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1983</xref>). Just as species responded individually to these changes with differing migration rates and pathways across the continent in the past (Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1983</xref>; Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2004</xref>), current suites of species will disassemble and new, transient community types will form (Hobbs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, in conservation areas—many of which were initially established to protect the biodiversity patterns present on the landscape (Groves et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>)—preserving historical patterns of structure, composition, and location of natural communities over the coming decades and centuries is an unrealistic expectation.
