<p class="p">Assessing the quantitative impact of possible flow alterations on SRs yielded several key findings: (1) Climate change was predicted to strongly decrease the low flows in both studied catchments; (2) the predicted increases and decreases in species abundances were not proportional to changes in flow metrics; and (3) predictions showed that species would experience decreased and increased abundances with regard to flow alterations detected by five IHA metrics in both the lowland and lower‐mountainous region. The species assemblage responses were predicted to increase at most sampling sites for most IHA metrics, which resulted in increasing OSARs in all Kinzig and 98% of Treene river reaches. These changes were significantly larger in the lower‐mountainous Kinzig compared to the lowland Treene catchment. The increased overall abundances are reasonable and can be described by the high proportion of generalist species, for example, only 26 and five habitat specialists in the Kinzig and Treene, respectively (according to Schmidt‐Kloiber &amp; Hering,

Generally, increased abundances are not identical to a better ecological status (according to regular monitoring required by the European Water Framework Directive) as the river‐type specific species might decrease in abundance while generalists or invasive species might increase strongly.
