<p class="p">Some studies reported changes up to −100% in species richness due to the loss of climatically suitable habitats caused by warming climates (Domisch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or extinctions (according to species probability of occurrences) by changes in flow and/or temperature (Pyne &amp; Poff, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Our findings show that the SRs barely exceeded percent‐change values ranging smaller than −50% and larger than +50% in the Treene and Kinzig catchments. We were only looking on the effect of climate change on stream macroinvertebrates via its effect on flow conditions. Even when generalists potentially will benefit from the flow alterations, other environmental variables that are changing with climate change may counteract. This reveals that flow alterations, as a single stressor, might not lead to catchment‐scale extinctions among the studied species, and hence, extinctions or more severe decreasing trends in species diversity may depend on additional effects from other environmental stressors (e.g., temperature) or decreasing habitat suitability (Dewson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Pyne &amp; Poff, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, differences in the taxonomic resolution, variables, and time scales or the smaller spatial scale with much finer resolution in our study, compared to other studies, might be the reason for the lower predicted impacts of climate change on stream macroinvertebrates observed in this study. Furthermore, our limited understanding of biotic interactions hinders attempts to add these factors to observed relationships.
