<p class="p">The largest and most significant changes in flow conditions were only partly reflected by species or species assemblage responses (SRs and SARs). For example, strong decreasing trends were predicted for metrics describing low‐flow conditions (frequency and magnitude of low‐flow events); however, species and assemblages showed strong responses (increased abundances) to other metrics that are projected to change less severely (e.g., Treene: rate of change in flow conditions [ra7], and Kinzig: duration of high‐flow events [dh4] and timing of low‐flow events [th3]). This revealed that even small changes in flow conditions possibly lead to strong SRs. Alternatively, slight changes in these flow conditions may result in a more suitable flow condition and subsequently a more suitable habitat that is closer to the species’ optimal preferences (e.g.,
