<p class="p">Moreover, the predicted decrease in abundances caused by fewer low‐flow events (fl1) in horizon 2090 might be due to the sensitive range of flow conditions, that is, minimum values, which will be affected most by climate change. An example of the modeled predictive relationship of

 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b) shows how species preferences to specific ranges of low‐flow frequencies (fl1) might cause their abundances to decrease. The peak preference values of about five annual low‐flow events indicate that the disturbances caused by more frequent low‐flow events lead to negative responses in this species. So this species might prefer low‐flow conditions in certain stages of their life cycle, for example, for hatching, laying eggs, or emergence (Lancaster &amp; Downes, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, the positive responses of SARs to fewer low‐flow events (fl1, Figure
