<p class="p">Furthermore, the decreased variability and frequency of low‐flow events observed in our climate models for both central European catchments, that is, less stress on the species in that respect, resulted in increasing abundances of both species and assemblages of stream macroinvertebrates. However, increasing frequencies of low‐flow events, and hence, decreasing species diversity were reported in other regions (Brooks &amp; Haeusler,
