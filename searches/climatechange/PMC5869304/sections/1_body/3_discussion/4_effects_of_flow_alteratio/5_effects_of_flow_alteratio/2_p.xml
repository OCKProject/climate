<p class="p">In this catchment‐scale study, the response of stream macroinvertebrates to flow alterations varied with river order, and most positive responses were detected in higher river orders, while most decreased abundances were detected in the lower river orders and upstream area. Headwater systems are critical areas for stream macroinvertebrates habitats (Meyer &amp; Wallace, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) because they are subject to more temporal and spatial variation (Gomi, Sidle, &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Hence, projected changes in the upstream area with lower discharge magnitudes will affect the species more than changes in the downstream area. For example, a slight but significant decrease in duration of high‐flow events (dh4) in both catchments was predicted to affect the communities in upstream reaches more than in downstream reaches (Figure

 <xref rid="ece33907-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>), as the increased abundances were detected in only downstream reaches (river order three) in both horizons. This means that the communities that inhabit the higher‐order reaches would benefit from climate change, and the predicted flow conditions would be closer to species’ flow preferences.
