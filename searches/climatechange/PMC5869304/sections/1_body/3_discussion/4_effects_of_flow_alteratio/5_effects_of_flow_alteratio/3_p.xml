<p class="p">The increase in SARs (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>k) caused by the decrease in peak flows in the Kinzig (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f horizon 2050) might be due to the fact that many species also occurring in the lowlands (i.e., generalists) suffer from high flows and will increase in abundance if the peak flows decrease, while the few specialists adapted to these high flows decrease in abundance (species with negative values in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>k). This is supported by the fact that the increase in abundance due to the reduced peak flows is much lower in the first‐order reaches compared to the larger third‐order reaches. Alternatively, because slope is very high in the first‐order reaches, only the rheophilic specialists occur in headwaters. The specialists will not benefit but suffer from a decrease in high flows, while the generalists occur usually in the third‐order reaches where the observed decrease in peak flows favors them.
