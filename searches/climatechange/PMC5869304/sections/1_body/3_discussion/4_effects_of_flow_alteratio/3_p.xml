<p class="p">The observed higher magnitude of SRs, SARs, and OSARs in the Kinzig compared to the Treene catchment might be linked to (1) the differences in flow regimes and catchment characteristics between the lowland (Treene) and lower‐mountainous region (Kinzig, Table 
 <xref rid="ece33907-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), and (2) different effects of climate change on flow regime in each region (lowland vs. lower‐mountainous region) according to climate models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Yet another possible explanation is the lower hydraulic and hydrological gradient in the Treene compared to the Kinzig, which lead to higher impact of even small flow alterations on stream macroinvertebrates responses. This confirmed the results of several studies (Buisson &amp; Grenouillet, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Fenoglio, Bo, Cucco, Mercalli, &amp; Malacarne, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Poff, Pyne, Bledsoe, Cuhaciyan, &amp; Carlisle, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), which reported that both species and assemblages of freshwater biota are likely to respond stronger in regions with higher streamflows (discharge) and stronger hydraulic and hydrological gradient, alternatively, because flow alterations are stronger in rivers with strong hydrological gradient and high streamflows (e.g., in the steeper lower‐mountainous Kinzig). Possibly, strong flow alterations—representing hydrological disturbances, create environmental filters for species occurrences, mainly through changing geomorphic and physical habitat conditions (Rolls et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Moreover, the higher channel slope in the Kinzig and hence the higher flow velocity, especially in the first‐order headwaters, has a stronger effect on the shear stress. If the shear stress at high flows decreases in the Kinzig (e.g., from 20 to 10 Nm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), this might have a tremendous effect on generalist species that cannot stand high shear stress while a small decrease in shear stress (e.g., from 5 to 2.5 Nm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in the lowland Treene is just reducing an already nondisturbing stress to an even lower stress.
