<p class="p">Overall, invertebrate abundance was predicted to increase due to climate change‚Äêinduced flow alterations (which we consider surprising). Although the species abundances can be affected by potential changes in other environmental variables (e.g., temperature), the observed increase in overall species assemblage abundances might be due to the fact that generalists will benefit from the flow alterations. However, the sensitive species of conservation interest are probably among the ones that will decrease in abundance (e.g., indicated by the much lower overall increase in abundances in the headwaters); therefore, further studies including information on the taxa groups increasing and decreasing in abundance will give more information on this.</p>
