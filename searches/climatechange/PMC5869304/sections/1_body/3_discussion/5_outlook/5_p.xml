<p class="p">Although the few studies that assessed the effects of multiple stressors on stream macroinvertebrates reported higher impacts of some stressors (e.g., land‐use) other than flow (Kuemmerlen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), flow alteration is reported to be among the most important variables affecting the species of stream macroinvertebrates (Poff, Tharme, &amp; Arthington, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The method introduced in this study, that is, the quantitative assessment of flow‐ecology relationships, can be applied to any specific IHA metric according to research interests (e.g., high‐/low‐flow conditions, extreme events, zero‐flow days) or any quantitative environmental variable (e.g., temperature) to assess the effects of global changes on river ecosystems. It can also be applied and modified for use in other regions and at different spatial and temporal scales. We suggest further quantitative flow alteration—species abundance relationship studies in other regions, for example, Mediterranean region or Alpine territory, where flow conditions might change differently than in central Europe.
