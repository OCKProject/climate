<p class="p">Effects of projected flow alterations might be manifested as either changes in community structure and composition of aquatic fauna or loss of ecosystem functioning and services (Laizé et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Our study suggests that changes in flow conditions would lead to a variety of responses in stream macroinvertebrates. These species are indicators of ecosystem health. Furthermore, healthy aquatic ecosystems provide ecosystem services such as clean drinking water (Brisbane Declaration, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Analyzing the responses of individual species to flow alterations might further reveal whether SRs to flow alterations can be considered as ecologically positive or negative. For example, increased abundances of, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">Dugesia</italic> sp. might be ecologically negative as it is known to be the indicator of low water quality (Johnson, Wiederholm, &amp; Rosenberg,
