<p class="p">For both river catchments, macroinvertebrate sample data were gathered from regional authorities. Samples were taken between 2005 and 2012 in the Kinzig catchment and between 2004 and 2015 in the Treene catchment. Sampling and identification was carried out according to the standardized multihabitat sampling protocol (Haase et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), where each sample is representative of a 100‐m river reach. All taxa were identified to the species level. The datasets consisted of 225 samples from 176 sites in the Kinzig and 70 samples from 30 sites in the Treene catchment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Species occurring at less than eight sampling sites were excluded, as these data might affect the robustness of the statistical analyses (Heino &amp; Soininen, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Leigh &amp; Datry, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which reduced the number of modeled species from 150 to 134 in the Kinzig and from 78 to 60 in the Treene catchment (Table
