<p class="p">Some samples were taken at the same sampling site but at different dates. To avoid temporal pseudo‐replication (Hale, Noble, Piper, Garmire, &amp; Tonsor,

 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>), only biological samples taken at the same sampling site but sampled at least 12 months apart were considered as temporally independent and were included in the analysis (Kakouei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The 12‐month time period did overlap for two (Kinzig) and three (Treene) samples taken at the same site, slightly lowering the number of samples from 225 to 223 in the Kinzig and from 70 to 67 in the Treene, respectively.
