<p class="p">The sensitivity of outcomes using another widely used aggregation method (the minimum aggregation method, also known as worst scenario) is shown in the supplementary material (potential worst OSARs, WOSAR). The minimum aggregation method assumes that decreased abundances caused by changes in one of the flow metrics might not be compensated by increased abundances caused by any other metrics.</p>
