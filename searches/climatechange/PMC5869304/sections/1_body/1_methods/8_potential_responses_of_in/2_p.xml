<p class="p">To account for the natural annual precipitation and discharge fluctuations (i.e., differences between wet and dry years), we compared three 20‐year periods instead of single years: a baseline period (i.e., current flow conditions from 1998 to 2017) and two future projected periods (named here as “horizon 2050” for the period between 2046 and 2064, and “horizon 2090” from 2080 to 2099; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). For each biological sampling site, the flow data modeled by SWAT (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d) were used to compute a single IHA‐metric value (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e) and to predict species abundance values (AV, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>f) for each year (12‐month period) of the three 20‐year periods, resulting in 60 IHA‐metric values and abundance values per species. The 20 AV per species were used to calculate a mean abundance value (MAV) for each of the three 20‐year periods (MAV
