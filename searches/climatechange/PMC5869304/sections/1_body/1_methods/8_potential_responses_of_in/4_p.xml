<p class="p">A positive value for percent change indicates an increase in species abundance and vice versa. In addition, SR to each IHA metric was calculated as the mean ∆‐Response of each species across all sampling sites; this was calculated separately for each of the two catchments and for each of the two future time periods. Species with the most negative SR values would be most susceptible to climate change‐induced flow alteration of the respective IHA metric in that catchment.</p>
