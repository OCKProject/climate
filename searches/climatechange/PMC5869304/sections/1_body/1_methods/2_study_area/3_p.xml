<p class="p">The following datasets were gathered in each catchment: (1) stream macroinvertebrate samples, (2) temporally corresponding gauge data for calibrating hydrological models and setting up predictive relationships between macroinvertebrates and flow conditions (i.e., discharge), and (3) projected high‚Äêresolution climate model data for simulating projected changes in flow conditions and deriving changes in SR.</p>
