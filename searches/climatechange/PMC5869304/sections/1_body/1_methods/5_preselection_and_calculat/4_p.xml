<p class="p">For all sampling sites in both river catchments, the IHA metrics (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b) were calculated based on the extrapolated gauge data from the 12‐month period prior to the date of the biological sampling (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). This period is expected to represent the effects of flow conditions on macroinvertebrates for a sample (Jourdan et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). For example, for a macroinvertebrate sample from 21.04.2013, flow data between 22.04.2012 and 21.04.2013 were considered.
