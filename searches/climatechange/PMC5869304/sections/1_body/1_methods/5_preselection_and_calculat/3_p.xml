<p class="p">The criteria resulted in the selection of different IHA metrics in the two study catchments (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33907-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>) due to differences in the flow regime and climatic‐/hydro‐morphological conditions in lower‐mountainous versus lowland regions. Some metrics were highly cocorrelated in the lowland Treene, while pairwise correlations remained below the sensitivity threshold in the lower‐mountainous Kinzig catchment. However, the selected metrics covered all five IHA categories; therefore, a diverse range of possible environmental responses to climate change‐induced flow alterations was expected (Burn &amp; Soulis, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). All other metrics were cocorrelated (|
