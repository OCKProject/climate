<p class="p">The 177 IHA metrics (Olden &amp; Poff, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) were grouped into five categories that provide information on changes in duration, magnitude, frequency, timing, and rate of flow events. All 177 IHA metrics were calculated for all sampling sites according to the flow data 12 months before the biological sampling using the flow data from the historical period 1997–2015 for each SWAT sub‐basin. To avoid redundancy, one metric per IHA category was selected in each river catchment according to the following criteria: (1) The pairwise correlation between IHA metrics should not exceed the sensitivity threshold of |

 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and (2) if it exceeds this threshold, the metric with the lower loading on the most significant principal component axes was excluded (for details see Olden and Poff (
