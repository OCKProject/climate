<p class="p">Climate change data for SWAT were prepared from the CORDEX (Jacob et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature dataset for Europe for the RCP 8.5 scenario. We selected this scenario because it is considered the worst‐case scenario and represents the most severe conditions, meaning that this scenario would set the upper limit for potential taxa responses. The CORDEX dataset provides the most recent and most detailed (11‐km resolution) climate change dataset for Europe. All 16 available global climate models and regional climate models were downloaded (ESGF, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and the time series were extracted from all climate stations where observed data were available for bias correction. The time series were bias‐corrected using six methods (linear scaling, delta change, distribution mapping, local intensity scaling, and power transformation; Teutschbein &amp; Seibert, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). All combinations of model types and bias corrections (in total, 80 per catchment) were run in the calibrated SWAT models for the Kinzig and Treene catchments (unpublished data). The hindcasted climate data from the global climate model MOHC‐HadGEM2‐ES, combined with the regional climate model CLMcom‐CCLM4‐8‐17 and the bias correction method “distribution mapping,” performed best in depicting the historic flow conditions in the Treene and Kinzig catchments; hence, this was the method also used for climate change predictions in this study. The CORDEX data were used for both the baseline (hindcasted) and the future conditions to ensure that results were not affected by differences between modeled and observed climate data.
