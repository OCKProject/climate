<p class="p">To obtain future projections of discharge, the hydrological processes in both catchments were modeled by the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool; Arnold, Srinivasan, Muttiah, &amp; Williams, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). SWAT is a semi‐distributed ecohydrological model that is used to calculate river discharge based on physical catchment data and climate time series. SWAT delineates a given catchment into sub‐basins, which are further divided into areas with similar soil, land‐use, and slope (i.e., hydrologic response units, HRUs). Processes such as evapotranspiration, surface runoff, interflow and groundwater components, infiltration, and soil water storage are depicted in each HRU and then aggregated to the sub‐basin scale (Guse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This procedure led to 22 sub‐basins in the Kinzig and 13 sub‐basins in the Treene catchment, for which daily simulated discharge data were available. The historical period from 1997 to 2015 was used to calibrate and validate the models. IHA metrics were calculated from simulated and observed discharge and the difference between the simulated and observed IHA metrics minimized during the calibration process (Kiesel et al.,
