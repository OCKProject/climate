<p class="p">The predictive relationships were derived using hierarchical logistic regression modeling (Huisman, Olff, &amp; Fresco,

 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), including all five Huisman–Olff–Fresco models and two extended models: the eHOF models flat response (I), monotone in‐/decreasing (II), interval optimum (III), symmetrical (IV), skewed (V), and the two extended models bimodal response with equal optima (VI), and bimodal response with unequal optima (VII). The ability of each model to support the data and to fit the observations was evaluated by comparing the Akaike information criterion (AICc).
