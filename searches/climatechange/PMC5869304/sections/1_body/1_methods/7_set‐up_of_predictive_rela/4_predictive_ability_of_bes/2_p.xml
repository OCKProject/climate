<p class="p">For each taxon, the predictive ability of the best model for each of the five IHA metrics was quantified by randomly separating the presences (observations, i.e., abundance data) and absences into training (75% of presences and 75% of absences) and testing (25% of presences and 25% of absences) datasets. We ran this random selection process 100 times, calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the test dataset, and subsequently averaged the 100 AUC scores per species (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33907-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> of the supplementary material for all model scores). The AUC measures the model's ability to discriminate between true and false positives (Hosmer, Lemeshow, &amp; Sturdivant, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). AUC values range from 0.5 (model is no better than random) to 1 (perfect discrimination). Hosmer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) report that AUC values &lt;0.7 represents a sensitive threshold of adequate model discrimination, a score that was not met by 17 species regarding the timing of high‐flow events (ta3) in the Treene catchment. We decided to keep all species in our analyses, but accounted for the model skill via a weighting scheme that was proportional to the model skill (the better the AUC, the higher the influence of the species in the final species assemblage response analysis). We used a continuous weighting factor from one to two with 0.02 intervals.
