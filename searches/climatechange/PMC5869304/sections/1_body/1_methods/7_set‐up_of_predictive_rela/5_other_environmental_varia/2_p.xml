<p class="p">The in situ occurrence and ecological response of stream macroinvertebrates depend on a variety of environmental variables, for example, land‐use, precipitation, and temperature (Pyne &amp; Poff,

Although none of these variables were directly used as covariates in this analysis, several variables (e.g., soil, land‐use and management, elevation and slope, precipitation, temperature, wind, humidity, and solar radiation) were considered in the SWAT hydrological models and, hence, were not duplicated as direct covariates in the modeling of taxa responses to flow alterations.
