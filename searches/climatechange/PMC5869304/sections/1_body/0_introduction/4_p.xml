<p class="p">Several studies have already assessed the ecological response of stream macroinvertebrates to climate change (Poff &amp; Zimmerman, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref> and references therein; Floury, Usseglio‐Polatera, Ferreol, Delattre, &amp; Souchon, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Chessman, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the absence of long‐term observational data, they focused on species ecological traits as the basis for their analyses. Species ecological traits have been reported to be informative and best‐case data for providing clues to the poorly understood mechanisms that threaten species occurrences in their environment (Matthews &amp; Marsh‐Matthews, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Moreover, potential responses and range shifts of species to climate‐change impacts might be identified by their ecological traits (Hamilton, Stamp, &amp; Bierwagen, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For example, a strong correlation between medium‐/high‐flow conditions and the occurrence of rheophilic species suggests that a projected decrease in flow conditions may have a major impact on the occurrence of these species (e.g., Chessman, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Thomson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, as traits information are often qualitative data stemming from literature reviews and expert knowledge (Schmidt‐Kloiber &amp; Hering, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), it is difficult to link traits to quantitative data and they are less suited to quantitatively assess and predict the effects of flow changes (e.g., discharge changes due to climate change).
