<p class="p">Only recently, discharge data have been used to empirically derive quantitative flow preferences for macroinvertebrates (Kakouei, Kiesel, Kail, Pusch, &amp; Jähnig, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). These flow preferences reveal species response (SR) along the range of flow conditions. The information on flow conditions is described by key flow metrics, for example, the indicators of hydrologic alterations—also known as IHA metrics (Richter, Baumgartner, Powell, &amp; Braun, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). The IHA metrics provide information on the duration, magnitude, frequency, timing, and rate of flow events for present patterns and also for potential future changes. The effects of climate change on ecologically important attributes of flow conditions (e.g., extreme events) have the potential to threaten ecosystem functioning (Jentsch &amp; Beierkuhnlein, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) by causing ecological changes in the structure and composition of aquatic communities (Poff &amp; Zimmerman, 
 <xref rid="ece33907-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Pyne &amp; Poff,
