<p class="p">Here, we introduce an approach that can be used to quantitatively predict the impacts of climate change‐induced flow alterations on the abundance of stream macroinvertebrates. We compared the predicted species’ abundances in two contrasting catchments differing in flow regime and species pool to answer the following questions:</p>
