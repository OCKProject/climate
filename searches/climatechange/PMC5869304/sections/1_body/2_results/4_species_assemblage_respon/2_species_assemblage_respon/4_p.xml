<p class="p">In the Kinzig, the SARs per metric shows—similar to the SR—large increases in species assemblage abundances caused by decreasing duration of high‐flow conditions (dh4), especially for the higher‐order reaches (river order three, Figure

 <xref rid="ece33907-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5a,b</xref>). The SARs to this metric were significantly higher in downstream reaches (i.e., river order three) with mostly increased AV compared to decreased values in the upstream reaches (ANOVA,
