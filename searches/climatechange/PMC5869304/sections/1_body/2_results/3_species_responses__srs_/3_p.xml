<p class="p">In the Kinzig catchment, in accordance with the large predicted effect on the low‐flow conditions, these IHA metrics (frequency and magnitude) resulted in a decrease in abundance for a large number of species. The share of these species was significantly larger for these two IHA metrics (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>q,m,r) compared to the other metrics (chi‐squared test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05). Projected changes in the magnitude of low‐flow events (ml18) caused decreasing trends, with a percentage change of up to −50% for most of the studied species in both horizons (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>m,r, 72% and 70% of species in horizon 2050 and 2090, respectively). The frequency of low‐flow events (fl1) caused greater decreases in abundances in horizon 2090, with 55% of species showing a decrease in abundance up to −46% (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33907-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>q).
