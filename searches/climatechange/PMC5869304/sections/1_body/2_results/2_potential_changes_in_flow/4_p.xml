<p class="p">In the Treene catchment, climate change was also predicted to most strongly affect the low‐flow conditions at the sampling sites, but modeled effects were larger compared to those in the Kinzig catchment (Figure

In respect to the high‐flow events, the modeled future discharge values showed an increase in the seasonal predictability of flooding (ta3, Figure
