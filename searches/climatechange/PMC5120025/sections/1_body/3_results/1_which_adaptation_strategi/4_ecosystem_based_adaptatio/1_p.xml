<p class="p">In Uttarakhand, both men and women had a high preference for strategies of agro-biodiversity management to support sustainable ecological functions and processes. Indeed, some participants in the focus groups stated that:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“Even if we don’t have grains to eat, we don’t eat our seed, but we maintain the original material (18)” (woman, Nainital district)</p>
 </disp-quote>Both men and women prioritized and adopted the management of specific local landraces, more suitable for responding to local environment and climatic variability. While men prioritized varieties that are able to adapt to prolonged drought and drier conditions (25), women prioritized planting taller varieties to guarantee their use for feeding both people and animals (23):
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“The crops and varieties have different functions and if we lost tall varieties, we cannot feeding both children and cows”. (women, FGD, Bageshwar district)</p>
 </disp-quote>Other agro-biodiversity strategies were also to some extent prioritized as responses to changing climate conditions, such as introducing more varieties and crops and planting more and diverse varieties and crops (20 and 21), as well as planting diverse crops and varieties together (i.e. intercropping and crop rotation) (28), which was widely adopted to guarantee minimizing the risk of losses. Men and women highlighted that such strategies facilitate the flow of new genetic material and the renewal of the diversity in fields:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“Climate is changing, we are now reintroducing new and diverse crop species and varieties for experimenting from areas with similar biophysical conditions, even if they are long away” (men, FGD, village Moura, Nainital district)</p>
 </disp-quote>However, in the most distant and less favourable villages, there was a shift towards permanent crops:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“We don’t know the climate, so we have changed our crops, introducing permanent crops. They also increase our income.” (men, FGD, village Kilor, Nainital district)</p>
 </disp-quote>Among the strategies for the management of ecological functions and processes, both men and women prioritized the maintenance of soil fertility through organic amendments (31), usually carried out collectively by women, and the soil and water conservation (32), usually carried out by men. Although they are widely adopted in more remote villages of Nainital district, the traditional and complex common use and management systems (34) are only partially considered as relevant to deal with climatic crises.
