<p class="p">The Himalayan region has been also recognized as particularly affected by climate change (Shiva and Bhatt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2009</xref>; IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2013</xref>). In Uttarakhand, climate change results in more intense and longer periods of drought, with decreasing snow events and late monsoons underpinning the lack of water resources in spring (Government of Uttarakhand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2014</xref>). These climatic changes act in tandem with other socio-cultural changes in demography, local economies (Jain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2010</xref>), agricultural practices and technology, food habits (Bisht et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2006</xref>; Nautiyal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2008</xref>) and environmental change (e.g. deforestation, natural resources degradation and the introduction of invasive species) that may be of particular concern in the context of the increased vulnerability of women (Nellemann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2011</xref>). In 2012, the Uttarakhand Action Plan for Climate change (UAPCC) recognized the increased feminization of agriculture and consequent vulnerability of women in the context of climate change, especially those small landholders that belong to the Dalit (i.e. the lowest) caste, and implemented a specific Women and Child Welfare Department.
