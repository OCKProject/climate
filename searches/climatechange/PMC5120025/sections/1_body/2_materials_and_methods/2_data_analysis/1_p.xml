<p class="p">A mixed qualitative–quantitative data analysis was performed in two stages. In the first stage, the information collected through focus groups was transcribed and systematized to identify and rank the relative importance of adaptation strategies to climate change and other drivers of change, as well as their impacts. This information was prioritized in each zone according to gender differences. Drawing on Vignola et al. (

Ecosystem-based adaptation strategies were classified into two dimensions: ‘conservation, restoration and sustainable management of (agro)biodiversity’ and ‘conservation, restoration and sustainable management of ecological functions and processes’. Similarly ‘social, cultural and economic-based adaptation strategies’ included the dimensions of ‘livelihood security’ and ‘societal ties and knowledge management’. A third category of adaptation strategies associated with technology was also considered: ‘technological strategies’. In addition, strategies were classified into ‘proactive strategies’ (i.e. planned or traditional actions which take place in anticipation of climate change or other stressors) and ‘reactive coping mechanisms’ (i.e. actions which occur after the fact with a view to managing impacts
