<p class="p">In this context, it is useful to introduce intersectionality—a feminist sociological concept first introduced by Crenshaw (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1991</xref>)—which leads us to critically understand the nature of differentiated vulnerability and adaptation due to the interactions among multiple dimensions of social and power relations (McCall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2005</xref>; Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2008</xref>). Recently, a growing body of research from critical feminist political ecology has raised awareness about the importance of intersectionality on adaptation to climate change in agrarian settings (Carr and Thompson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2014</xref>; Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">2014</xref>; Ogra and Badola 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the Asian context, for instance, several empirical studies clearly confirmed the interplay of multiple identities, such as caste, economic class and gender, shaping differentiated vulnerability to risks and disasters (Ahmed and Fajber 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2009</xref>; Ray-Bennett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2009</xref>; Onta and Resurreccion 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2011</xref>). Other studies found that social class, household head gender, age and stage of life may determine women’s ability to respond to water scarcity (Huynh and Resurrección 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2014</xref>). Similar interactions have been identified in Africa, where the joint effects of gender, access to education, land and credit are analysed as local determinants of the capacity to adapt to decreasing precipitation (Below et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2012</xref>; Fosu-Mensah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2012</xref>). The intersectionality framework, thus, has potential application as an analytical tool for understanding how interactions among multiple social dimensions of power can determine the development of adaptation strategies to climate and other concomitant drivers of change (Adger and Kelly 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1999</xref>; Nightingale 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2011</xref>; Marino and Ribot 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, methodological discussions on how to implement such a framework are open and empirical applications remain to be undertaken (Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lykke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kaijser and Kronsell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2014</xref>).
