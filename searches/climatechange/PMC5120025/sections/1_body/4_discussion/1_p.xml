<p class="p">At a first tier of analysis, our findings highlight how bundles of strategies are prioritized and adopted depending on the socio-ecological context, but mediated by a gendered nature of perceptions and decision-making within the household. In the more remote areas of Uttarakhand, a sustainable management of ecological functions and processes and agro-biodiversity are prioritized as a question of livelihood security. These findings are similar to those found in other mountain contexts in the world, for example in the Himalayan mountains (Regmi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2009</xref>), in the Pamir mountains (Partoev 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2012</xref>; Zimmerer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2014</xref>) and in the Andean mountains (Narloch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>). As noted elsewhere, such strategies are risk-smoothing in the context of climatic variability (Kotschi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2007</xref>; Lipper and Cooper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2009</xref>; Pascual et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2015</xref>), especially in low-intensity agro-ecosystems (Pascual et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hellin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2014</xref>). Women are especially concerned with complementing agro-biodiversity management with social ties and knowledge system management mainly through exchanges of knowledge and planting materials (crops and varieties in different fields). This is reflected by a major adoption of such strategies when women are making decisions within the family. However, the data show several shifts in the strategies related to agro-biodiversity and ecological functions management. These include changes towards permanent crops and the introduction of high-yield improved seeds. Such changes are more evident in the mid-plains of Bihar, where there is a long history of external interventions and technological strategies which complement the range of strategies adopted to ensure livelihood security. This result suggests that ecosystem-based strategies are not always preferred among small-holders farmers, possibly due to the trade-offs between the benefits of adaptation in the long term and the possible transition costs in the short term, such as those related to labour intensity (as suggested by Bhattarai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2015</xref>). Additionally, our findings suggest that there are differences in the awareness of individual family members to change and thus different responses are preferred and adopted to cope with shock events. Hence, a priori assumptions on the basis of a male/female dichotomy are unable to lead to a comprehensive understanding of farmersâ€™ choices, vulnerability, adaptation processes and barriers to adoption.
