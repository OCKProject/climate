 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>, our study used Maxent to model its potential distribution based on occurrence records and environmental variables (including soil, land cover, vegetation coverage, topographical variables, and bioclimatic variables). First, dominant environmental variables were selected to build a model; second, current bioclimatic variables were used to estimate the current climatic suitable habitat; finally, potential distributions under different future climate scenarios were predicted.
