<p class="p">This study projected the potential distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> under current and future climate change scenarios and determined the dominant environmental variables that affect changes in the distribution. This result could play an important role in location selection for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> cultivation and wild 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> reserve design. In addition, the changes in the range and altitude of the highly suitable habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> were analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the highly suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> will obviously decrease under future climate change scenarios in 2050 and 2070. We also found that the area of highly suitable habitats below 500 m and above 2300 m will decline in the future. Therefore, the impact of climate change on plant resource protection and sustainable development must be thoroughly investigated, particularly for estimating the extinction risks of environmentally sensitive species.
