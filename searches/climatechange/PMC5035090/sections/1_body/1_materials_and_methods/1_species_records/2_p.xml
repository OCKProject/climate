 <xref rid="pone.0163718.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] was used to reduce any negative effects that may have been caused by spatial autocorrelations in the high-density collections from populated areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0163718.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. With this grid in place, the occurrences were then filtered using SDM Tools [
 <xref rid="pone.0163718.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]; one record was randomly picked from each grid. After filtering, 732 records remained.
