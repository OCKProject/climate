<p class="p">A total of 42 environmental variables pertaining to climate, soil, topography, land cover, and vegetation coverage were collected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163718.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). And all environmental variables were converted into 30 arc second (~1 km) spatial resolution. High correlations among these variables decreased the accuracy of the SDM [
 <xref rid="pone.0163718.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]; therefore, these variables were filtered to reduce this effect. The 19 bioclimatic variables were clustered into four groups that were highly correlated with the mean annual value of temperature and precipitation and their intra-annual precipitation fluctuations [
