The most recent climate projections were used in the Fifth Assessment IPCC report. These data were generated from general circulation models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5). To reduce the bias in certain areas from one GCM, the multi-model ensemble (MME) average was used. This method has been shown to provide superior results to those obtained from one model [
