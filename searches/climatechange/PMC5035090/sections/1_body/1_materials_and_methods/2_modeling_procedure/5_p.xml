 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>. According to the presence probability, suitable regions for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> were divided into three levels: low suitable regions (0-T), medium suitable regions (T-0.5), and highly suitable regions (0.5–1.0). The term “T” represents the 10th percentile threshold [
 <xref rid="pone.0163718.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Finally, the suitable regions and their altitudes under different climate conditions were analyzed using ArcGIS 10. Difference in the mean pixel freauency and mean altitude of highly suitable region for current and future climatic scenarios were tested using one-way ANOVAs and Tukey’s HSD comparisons in IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
