 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> was projected, and then the future potential distributions from four different RCP scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) were projected in two future periods (2050 and 2070) based on the assumptions that soil, topography, land cover, and vegetation coverage would not change under different climatic scenarios.
