<p class="p">The top three variables with high contributions toward determining the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> were precipitation in the warmest quarter, annual mean temperature, and altitude. The precipitation in the warmest quarter showed the highest contribution (28.71%) and ranged from 148 mm to 512 mm in highly suitable areas. The annual mean temperature provided an almost identical contribution. The highly suitable range was 8.4°C to 15.4°C. Altitude was a significant variable that could explain the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>. Its contribution accounted for 17.13%, and the highly suitable range was 100 m to 2000 m. These results were consistent with the current habit requirements of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>, which grows well in cool temperatures, is drought resistant, and is commonly found on sunny slopes, forest edges, roadsides, and ridges of fields [
