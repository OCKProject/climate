 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> in all eight future scenarios will decrease, and the medium suitable habitat will increase relative to the current area. In four scenarios (RCP2.6 2050, RCP6.0 2050, RCP8.5 2050 and RCP2.6 2070), the low and highly suitable habitat will decline, and the medium suitable habitat will increase. In the other four scenarios (RCP4.5 2050, RCP4.5 2070, RCP6.0 2070 and RCP8.5 2070), the low and medium suitable habitats will increase, and the highly suitable habitat will decline.
