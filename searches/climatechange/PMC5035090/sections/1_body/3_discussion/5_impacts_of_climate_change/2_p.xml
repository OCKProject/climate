However, in our study, the current mean altitude of highly suitable habitats was lower than that in scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP 4.5 in 2050, almost equal to the value in scenarios RCP6.0 and RCP 8.5 in 2050, but was higher than that in all scenarios in 2070. The centroids of the highly suitable habitat for

Analyzing of the variation in every hundred meters elevation relative to the current suggested that the highly suitable habitat of
