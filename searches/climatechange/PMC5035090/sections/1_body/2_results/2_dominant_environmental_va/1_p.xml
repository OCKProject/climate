 <xref rid="pone.0163718.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) of environmental variables to the Maxent models under the current scenario, the top three variables that affected the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> were as follows: precipitation in the warmest quarter (BIO18), annual mean temperature (BIO1), and altitude (ALT). The total contribution of the three variables was 73.91%, suggesting that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> distributions are strongly influenced by these three environmental variables. The total contribution of five climatic variables was 61.82%. The total contribution of three topographic variables was 19.96%. However, the contribution of ten soil variables totaled 12.20%. This showed that climatic variables had a much greater impact than topography, soil, land cover, and vegetation coverage on the habitat distribution of
