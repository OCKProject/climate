<p class="p">The annual mean temperature was another important variable that affected the distribution of

 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163718.g003" class="xref">Fig 3b</xref>). When the annual mean temperature fell below -2.5°C, the presence probability of finding 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> was less than 5%. When this temperature was in the range of 8.4°C to 15.4°C, the presence probability was higher than 50%. In other words, regions with such a range of annual temperature may be better candidates for planting 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>.
