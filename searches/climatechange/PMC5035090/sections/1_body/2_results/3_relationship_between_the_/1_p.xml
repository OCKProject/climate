<p class="p">The relationship between presence probability of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. tenuifolia and precipitation in the warmest quarter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163718.g003" class="xref">Fig 3a</xref>) showed that when the precipitation was below 23 mm, the presence probability of finding 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> was less than 5%. When the precipitation in the warmest quarter ranged between 148 mm and 512 mm, the presence probability was higher than 50%. Precipitation in the warmest quarter from 148 mm and 512 mm might be effective predictor for modeling the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic>.
