<p class="p">A separate analysis that focused on the altitude patterns among the highly suitable districts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163718.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>) is shown below. Under all scenarios, except for RCP 4.5 2050, the highly suitable habitat area below 100 m will increase in the range of 4.37% to 113.18%, and decrease in the range of -7.34% to -42.79% between 100 m and 200 m. In the range of 200 m to 1500 m, the highly suitable habitat area will fluctuate between -18.41% and 9.63%. The highly suitable habitat area in the range of 1500 m to 2400 m, will vary between -34.29% and 19.92%. Above 2400 m, under all the future scenarios except for RCP2.6 in 2050, highly suitable habitat area will decline from -5.30% to -100% as the increasing elevation.
