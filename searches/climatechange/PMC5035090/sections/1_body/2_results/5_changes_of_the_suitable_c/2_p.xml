 <italic class="italic">tenuifolia</italic> under the four RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) will increase by 9.43%, 0.03%, 5.00% and 4.81%, respectively. The total area of the highly suitable district will decrease by 4.09%, 1.00%, 8.37% and 8.55% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163718.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). Under scenario RCP2.6 2050 and RCP6.0 2050, the areas of the low suitable regions will decline by 1.12% and 0.05%, but almost no change will occur under RCP4.5 2050 and RCP8.5 in 2050. In Northwest Fujian, East Jiangxi, West Zhejiang, Northeast Yunnan, West Guizhou, North Inner Mongolia, East Henan, and East Liaoning, low suitability regions will be converted into medium suitable regions. The region in which medium suitable regions will become low suitable regions is mainly distributed in East Jilin, Hunan, Guizhou, and North Inner Mongolia. The highly suitable region that will be transformed from medium suitable regions includes Southwest Liaoning, North Hebei, Northwest Shanxi, West Henan, Southeast Shaanxi, South Ningxia, and South Gansu. In Central Shandong, Southwest Shanxi, Central Shaanxi, Central Gansu, Central Ningxia, and West Jilin, highly suitable regions will be transformed into medium suitability regions. Altogether, the potential distribution in 2050 will contract in the northeast and expand in southeast, southwest and north (
