 </sup>. From the 19 bioclimatic variables considered for analysis, four were selected to be included in the distribution models of bumblebees for years 1960â€“1990: annual mean temperature (Bioclim1), temperature seasonality (Bioclim4), annual precipitation (Bioclim12), and precipitation seasonality (Bioclim15). These environmental characteristics are ecologically significant for bumblebees
