 </sup>. We used GCMs generated by four major organizations, including the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences, the Meteorological Office Hadley Centre, the University of Tokyo Center for Climate System Research, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. We investigated future years 2050 (average of 2041 to 2060) and 2070 (average of 2061 to 2080). Each GCM forecasts future climate based on the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), developed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report

 </sup>. RCPs represent different trajectories of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration, where GHG concentration peaks between 2010 and 2020 for RCP2.6, in 2040 for RCP4.5, in 2080 for RCP6.0, or rise continuously to 2100 for RCP8.5.
