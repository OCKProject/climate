<p id="Par15" class="p">Species-specific logistic probabilities of occurrence were averaged across GCMs, for each RCP scenario and time period, using ArcGIS 10.2. To obtain binary presence-absence maps, we used the probability of occurrence threshold that maximized the True Skill Statistic (TSS) for each species, as recommended

 </sup>. Dispersal scenarios were then applied to binary maps by clipping modeled projections to 0 km/year, 10 km/year, and unlimited dispersal rates from current distributions. Maps were summed across all species for the four RCPs, three dispersal scenarios, and two time periods to generate a total of 24 species richness maps. Changes in species’ suitable ranges across North America were plotted using R statistical software. Differences between current suitable range and future scenarios revealed areas projected to gain or lose species, which were then overlapped across all species and RCPs to identify regions where they are concentrated. These overlaps were examined using land-use data. Land use data for 2016 were downloaded from the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) at

 </sup>. The HYDE dataset combines satellite data and statistics of world population, cropland and pasture in 5 arc-minutes resolution maps. Richness changes were analysed for agricultural areas, but we caution that comparative trends in richness change within agricultural areas could be overstated, since our dataset focuses on species whose ranges overlap those areas.
