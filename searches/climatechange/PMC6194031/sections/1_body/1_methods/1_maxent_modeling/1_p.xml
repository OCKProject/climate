<p id="Par9" class="p">Current and future species-specific distributions based on climatic conditions were projected using Maxent models. These models predict species distributions using existing records and their associate environmental conditions, comparing them to background points, to estimate the edges of species’ tolerances and extrapolate species ranges beyond its known distribution
