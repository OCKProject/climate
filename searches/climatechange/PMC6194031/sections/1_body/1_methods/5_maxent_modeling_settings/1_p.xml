<p id="Par14" class="p">Model settings accounted for uncertainty in future climate change and data limitations. Species-specific bias files were created on ArcGIS with minimum convex polygons around occurrence points, to decrease the probability of including suitable but uncolonised localities in the model as background points, which can lead to commission errors
