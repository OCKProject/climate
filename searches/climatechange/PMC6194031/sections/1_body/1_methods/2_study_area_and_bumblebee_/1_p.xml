<p id="Par10" class="p">Primary bumblebee data included 324,502 observations across the North American continent (24 230 000 km2; See Supplementary Information for species list). Georeferenced observations of 31 bumblebee species sampled during years 1960 to 1990 inclusively were extracted, for a total of 19,753 records (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Clusters of observations can cause the model to be overfit, which leads to predicted ranges conforming too narrowly to areas where the species has been observed, an effect that can deceptively increase model performance statistics
