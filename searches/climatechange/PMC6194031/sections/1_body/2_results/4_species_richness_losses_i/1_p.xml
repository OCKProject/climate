<p id="Par22" class="p">Species richness decline is disproportionately severe in agricultural areas. Within agricultural areas, most areas lost species and few gained species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The least severe climate change scenario (RCP2.6) is distinct from the other three scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) in which species richness loss was consistently superior. Dispersal scenarios did not affect this outcome, although slower dispersal led to aggravated species richness decline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
