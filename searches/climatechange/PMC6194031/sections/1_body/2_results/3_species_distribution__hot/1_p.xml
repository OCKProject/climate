<p id="Par20" class="p">Regions where multiple bumblebee species’ ranges were projected to expand in 2070 were concentrated, and generally not located beyond the northern limit of densely sampled observations. These hotspots were mapped and overlapped across all RCP scenarios to identify areas suitable for new species in the future regardless of climate trajectory (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). By 2070, these areas were large, ranging from 11 419 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (9 species) to 2 447 283 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (3 species). They are mostly found in Ontario, Quebec and northern parts of Michigan, while generally less prevalent in western parts of the continent. Ecoregion types associated with hotspots are mainly mixed wood plains, mixed wood shield and softwood shield (WWF 2016). Less than 25% of these areas are currently developed or disturbed for agricultural purposes, according to the HYDE 2016 land use dataset.
