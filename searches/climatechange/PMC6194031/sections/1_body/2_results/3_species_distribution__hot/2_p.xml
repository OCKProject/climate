Losses primarily occurred in Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, and are essentially dominated by Ozark, Ouachita-Appalachian Forests, south-eastern USA plains, central USA plains, and mixed wood plains ecoregions (WWF 2016). These ecoregions are generally dominated by agricultural lands, developed land, or by mosaics of forest, pasture, cropland, developed land, and/or wetlands
