<p id="Par18" class="p">Models showed range expansions for about half of bumblebee species under unlimited dispersal scenarios in both 2050 and 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Between 0–13% of species expanded in range, varying with RCP scenarios, when dispersal input was closer to realistic abilities (10 km/year) by 2050. This proportion increased to 0–30% by 2070, but most expansions were only found in a single climate scenario (RCP2.6) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Only 
 <italic class="italic">Bombus pensylvanicus</italic> was projected to expand in all RCPs, in both 2050 and 2070 when dispersal was constrained to 10 km/year. Expansions were not possible restricting species from dispersal in future years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>).
