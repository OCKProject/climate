<p id="Par19" class="p">Even assuming unlimited dispersal, nearly half of bumblebee species were projected to face significant range losses by 2050 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Constraining dispersal to 10 km/year aggravated range losses of 87–97% of modeled species’ current range by 2050, increasing to 70–97% by 2070, depending on the RCP outcome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Under no dispersal, models showed losses of over half of current suitable range by 2050 for some species, rising to nearly three quarters by 2070. Only 
 <italic class="italic">Bombus pensylvanicus</italic> maintained relatively stable distributions in all RCP scenarios, under this dispersal scenario, for both 2050 and 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The discrepancy of range changes between different RCPs was far more significant in 2070; mean standard deviation in suitable range changes doubled from 2050 to 2070 under all three dispersal scenarios.
