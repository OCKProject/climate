<p id="Par26" class="p">Our approach is conservative in its assessment of potential range losses among bumblebees by excluding measures of potential land-use impacts from models. Including land-use data at appropriate spatial scale in Maxent modeling processes would probably assess species niches more broadly than purely on climatic grounds
