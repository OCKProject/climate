<p id="Par32" class="p">Bumblebee speciesâ€™ dispersal capacities and generalized losses of climatically suitable areas make it likely that most bumblebee species included here will see substantial range losses in the coming decades. Widespread range losses for North American bumblebees seem likely even when assuming improbably rapid dispersal that has only been observed in the most extreme instances of

 </sup> and their projected declines are especially pronounced in agricultural areas, so global change-induced erosion of those services could have both ecological and pronounced economic significance
