<p id="Par23" class="p">All model results, regardless of climate change scenarios or assumptions about dispersal capacity, suggest that significant declines of bumblebee species across much of North America are likely. Models reveal large range losses even in scenarios where dispersal abilities are estimated using the highest recorded dispersal rates for an invasive bumblebee species (10 km/year)

 </sup>. Across a range of realistic dispersal rates, few bumblebee species are likely to maintain stable geographical range sizes, let alone track warming rapidly into historically-unoccupied areas beyond species’ current ranges. Even pollinators known to disperse at especially high rates under climate change, such as some butterfly species, have accumulated substantial climate debt
