<p id="Par8" class="p">This study asks: how are bumblebee species’ climatically suitable ranges projected to change under different future climate scenarios and with different dispersal abilities? Additionally, are there potential hotspots for the conservation of North American bumblebee species under different climate change scenarios? Potential climate change-related impacts on bumblebee distribution were investigated using a massive dataset of georeferenced observations to generate species distribution models. While relatively few such efforts have yet been made for bees, these models show promise in terms of improving understanding of bumblebee species’ responses to environmental change
