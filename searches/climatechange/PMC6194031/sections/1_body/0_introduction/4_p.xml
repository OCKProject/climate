<p id="Par5" class="p">The question of whether species’ niche limits, as modeled by SDMs, match their realised range limits is a known challenge in distribution modeling research. In most cases, modeled niche limits encompass observed range limits, beyond which habitat suitability and fitness decline

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. Alternatively, species’ ranges can be distinct from niche limits due to limiting biotic interactions (e.g. antagonist interactions), to physical barriers that limit dispersal, and to low dispersal capacities. As broad-scale environmental changes modify the position of species’ niche limits, an expansion or contraction of species’ range limits over time can occur

 </sup>. When range and niche limits do not coincide, dispersal is key for range-shifts to occur and maintain suitable range where species can persist
