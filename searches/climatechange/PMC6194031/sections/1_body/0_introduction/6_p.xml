<p id="Par7" class="p">Investigating bumblebees’ dispersal capacity is important to assess their ability to track suitable environmental conditions and avoid net range losses as climate changes. For bumblebees, dispersal ability (as it translates to changes in species’ geographical ranges) corresponds to the distance that mated queens can travel to establish a new colony
