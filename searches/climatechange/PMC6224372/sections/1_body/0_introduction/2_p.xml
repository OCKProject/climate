<p class="p">An increasing number of studies report that climate warming is driving essential changes in alpine and arctic plant communities, such as phenology (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2016</xref>), species distribution ranges (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van der Wal et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grytnes et al., 2014</xref>), species abundances (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmendorf et al., 2012a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>) and species richness (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wipf et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Steinbauer et al., 2018</xref>). Although there are general patterns emerging, there are also some inconsistencies. For example, experimental warming by open top chambers (OTCs) in Tibet observed delayed reproductive phenology and decreased number of inflorescences of dominant species (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dorji et al., 2014</xref>), whereas warming by transplantation to lower elevations found advanced flowering dates (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, whereas warming by OTCs decrease alpine and arctic species diversity (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmendorf et al., 2012a</xref>), studies resampling historical data find increased species richness in alpine regions (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Steinbauer et al., 2018</xref>). Part of this variation can be due to different methods (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmendorf et al., 2015</xref>), and typically four primary approaches have been used to study impacts of climate warming on alpine plant community properties: studies along natural elevation gradients (space-for-time substitution), resampling or monitoring over time, experimental warming by OTCs, and whole-community transplantation to warmer climates.
