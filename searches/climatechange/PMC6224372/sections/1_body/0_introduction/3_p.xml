<p class="p">Elevation gradient studies allow investigating community responses to a broader range of both abiotic and biotic environmental conditions, including direct and indirect effects of climate change. These communities do, however, reflect responses over longer time scales, and may therefore overestimate plant community responses to current climate changes (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmendorf et al., 2015</xref>). Resampling or long-term monitoring can provide important information on how plant communities respond to both short-term changes in weather and long-term changes in climate (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gottfried et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wipf et al., 2013</xref>). However, these approaches require historical data, or several years of monitoring, and, as both resampling and long-term monitoring are observational approaches, they cannot disentangle the different factors driving the changes observed. Experimental warming can better explore cause-and-effect relationships between plant communities and climate change, as well as provide a mechanistic understanding of short-term responses of ecosystems to climate warming (

 <italic class="italic">In situ</italic> passive warming approaches, such as OTCs, have widely been applied to warm extant vegetation in alpine and arctic regions (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elmendorf et al., 2012a</xref>). The walls of the OTCs, may, however, constrain immigration and migration of plant species in the same way as they have been shown to affect pollination by wind and insects (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Totland and Eide, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, OTCs may not take into account novel interactions from new colonizers in warmer climates (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alexander et al., 2015</xref>). OTCs are also conservative warming devices, with an increase of mean daily temperature by 
 <italic class="italic">c.</italic> 1.5Â°C in alpine and arctic tundra (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marion et al., 1997</xref>), which in some areas, is low compared to variations between years (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollister and Webber, 2000</xref>). They therefore need to be installed for a long time to affect the vegetation (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollister et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hudson and Henry, 2010</xref>). Indeed, high stability and resistance observed in low-productivity alpine and arctic plant communities to warming by OTCs can be due to the minor warming (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hudson and Henry, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keuper et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the warming effect of OTCs can be confounded with changes in the microenvironment such as soil moisture, wind or snow accumulation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marion et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollister et al., 2005</xref>). Another approach that contrasts the traditional 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> warming experiments is plant community transplantation (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nooten and Hughes, 2017</xref>), following classical transplants of individual plants (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clausen et al., 1948</xref>). Intact turfs of whole plant communities are moved to a lower elevation exposing it to a warmer climate in combination with a new neighborhood community. In other words, transplantation may change both the abiotic and the biotic environment, and can therefore examine the net effect of both direct and indirect impacts of climate warming (
