<p class="p">Thus, different approaches address specific questions in their own way (

Here, we used two experimental warming approaches parallel and integrated them with a gradient approach in a single study in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China to test congruency among them. We conducted warming experiments using

Plant species richness and cover were measured each year from 2012 to 2016. Our study addresses two questions: (1) how do plant communities respond to the three different climate warming approaches? (2) how can the combined approaches improve predictions of plant community responses to climate change?
