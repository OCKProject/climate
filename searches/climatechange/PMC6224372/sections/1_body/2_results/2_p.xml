<p class="p">Species richness gradually decreases toward warmer climates, both in the ambient plots along the elevation gradient and in the OTCs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3, S4</xref>). Transplanting to warmer climates appears to increase species richness in the coldest sites, but decrease species richness in the warmest site. Evenness decreased in OTCs at the warmest site and in plots transplanted to a lower elevation in the warmest climates, i.e., from the Middle to the Low elevation site. The proportion of graminoids increased toward warmer climates only in plots transplanted to the warmest elevation (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Tables 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S3, S4</xref>).
