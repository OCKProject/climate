<p class="p">Warming by both OTCs and transplants changed the species communities over the 5 years “
 <italic class="italic">away</italic>” from the control communities at the origin sites, with the change being stronger at lower elevations (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Species composition in the OTC responded less to warming along the elevation gradient compared to the transplanted communities, i.e., they differed significantly stronger from the control communities at the Middle site. Interestingly, species composition in the OTCs and in plots that have been transplanted to warmer climates seem to change in slightly different directions. Transplanted plots appear to move more consistently “
 <italic class="italic">toward”</italic> the target community, i.e., the species composition in the control plot of the site in which they have been transplanted to (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, orange line moves more toward the gray dashed line). More species showed a stronger positive or negative response the warming treatment in the transplants, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Persicaria vivipara</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Saussurea ceterach</italic> at the High alpine and Alpine site and 
 <italic class="italic">Pedicularis davidii</italic> at the Alpine and Middle site (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S5</xref>). Across all sites, both the transplants and OTC communities were far away from converging toward the target community even after 5 years. And indeed, at the Middle site the OTC showed no indication of moving toward the target community.
