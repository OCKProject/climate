<p class="p">Seven blocks were randomly positioned in each of the sites in 2012, covering an area of ca 400 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The distance between the replicate blocks ranges from 4 to 6 m. In each block, we randomly positioned four 25 cm Ã— 25 cm plots. One was used for 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> warming by OTC, one was transplanted to warmer climates, one was transplanted locally within the same block to control for any transplant effect, and one was used as an untouched control (Supplementary Figure
