<p class="p">To quantify and visualize the temporal changes in species composition between the warming approaches, we used principle response curves (PRC; 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999</xref>). PRC is the multivariate equivalent of repeated measures ANOVA, and analyses the community response through time to one or more treatments relative to a control. It is a partial RDA where treatments and time are included as factorial variables in a model analyzing the effects of the time x treatment interaction while including time as a covariate to control for any overall temporal trends. Treatment effects (

 <sub class="sub">dt</sub>) quantify the compositional difference between treated plots and controls at each sampling date, and temporal trends can be visualized by plotting 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dt</sub> against time. We performed two separate PRCs on the forb community only because of the more detailed taxonomic resolution in the forbs. Rare species, that occurred less than three times in the whole data set were removed for this analysis.
