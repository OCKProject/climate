<p class="p">To test how plant community properties change along the elevational gradient (i.e., represented as change in mean summer temperature among sites) and/or respond to the two different warming treatments (i.e., mean summer temperature contrasts between control and warming treatment), we fit linear models independently for each warming approach with species richness, evenness, or proportion of graminoids as response variable. We checked the fulfillment of the model assumptions visually and evenness had a heavy tail of negative residuals (2–3 observations). For the gradient approach, we fit two models: an intercept-only null model (no effect) and a model with mean summer temperature at each site (effect). For the two experimental warming treatments, we fitted three models: one containing the experimental site (no effect), one with experimental site and temperature contrast (effect) and one with the interactions of experimental site and temperature contrast (interaction). The effects of experimental site and temperature were tested by comparing the difference in Aikaike information criterion (AIC) score Δ
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> among these models differing in their fixed effects (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>). A difference in AIC scores of Δ
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> &gt; 2 between models indicates strong support for the model with lower AIC score (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>). The model with the lowest AIC score was chosen as the best model, except when competing models differed by Δ
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> &lt; 2, then the model with fewest parameters was selected.
