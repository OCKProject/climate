<p class="p">The study was conducted in the Hengduan Mountains, in southwestern China. The study sites are located in Kang-Ding Valley, northwest of Mt. Gongga (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>), which is characterized by steep vertical elevational gradients, and vegetation belts changing from mixed coniferous-broadleaves forest and subalpine coniferous forest, to shrubs and alpine meadows with increasing elevation (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shen et al., 2001</xref>). Long term climate data extracted from Worldclim version 2.0 from the period 1970–2000 in the area show a mean annual temperature of 11.6°C and mean annual precipitation of c. 800 mm (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fick and Hijmans, 2017</xref>). We selected four perennial grassland sites spanning from the mixed leaf forest to the alpine climatic zone, differing on average by 1.75°C (range: 1.5–2.1°C ) mean air temperature (June–August) between the sites (5.3°C between the lowest to the highest site), including a Low (3000 m a.s.l.), Middle (3500 m a.s.l.), Alpine (3850 m a.s.l.), and High alpine (4130 m a.s.l.), site (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>). The geographical distance between adjacent sites is on average 10 km. The sites were selected to be as similar as possible in terms of vegetation, soil and grazing regime to enable between-site comparisons. The vegetation in all sites is dominated by grasses (

 <italic class="italic">Kobresia</italic> spp.), forbs (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Anaphalis nepalensis, Clinopodium polycephalum, Geranium pylzowianum, Polygonum viviparum, Potentilla leuconata, P. stenophylla</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Saussurea</italic> spp.), and some shrubs (
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron</italic> spp.) at the highest sites (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S2</xref> for species list). All the sites are associated with mountain gray-brown soil originating from granite (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">He et al., 2005</xref>). There is moderate livestock grazing by yak, sheep, or horses in all the sites, and fences were used during the study to prevent grazers inside the plots. We simulated grazing by cutting vegetation to ca 5 cm to avoid any fence effects.
