<p class="p">All vascular plant species in each plot were surveyed in 2012 (before treatment), and annually between 2013 and 2016. Percent cover of each vascular species was visually estimated during the peak of the growing season using a 25 cm × 25 cm frame with a grid of 5 cm × 5 cm subplots. Mean vegetation height for each plot was measured at five points in 2013 using a ruler. Forbs were identified to species level, whereas many of the graminoids were identified to genus level, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Carex</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Poa</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Kobresia</italic> spp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Festuca</italic> spp., because of a lack of a detailed flora from the study region and thus difficulties with identification of sterile graminoids.
