<p class="p">A climate station (U30-NRC, Onset, United States) at each site recorded air temperature at 2 m and soil moisture at −5 cm in 10 min intervals since September 2012 and during the whole study period. We measured biomass at each of the sites in 2015 to have an estimate of productivity along the gradient (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We did this by harvesting all above ground biomass from 13 0.5 m × 0.5 m plots at the High alpine site and 20 plots from the other sites, and oven-dried it at 60°C for 72 h before weighing.
