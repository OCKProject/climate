  <p class="p">Change in species richness, evenness, and proportion of graminoids along the elevation gradient, represented by mean summer temperature 
   <bold class="bold">(left)</bold>, and in OTCs and transplants, represented by 1.5 and 1.75Â°C temperature contrasts 
   <bold class="bold">(right)</bold>. Significant interactions of warming effects between sites are shown by solid lines, significant overall effects across sites in stapled lines, and no effects in dotted lines. Different colors indicate the sites, High alpine, Alpine, Middle and Lowland, and symbols show the treatments, control, local transplant, OTC and transplant.
