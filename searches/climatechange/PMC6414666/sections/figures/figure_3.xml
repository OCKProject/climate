   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Density distribution and quantile plot of temperatures from the thermal profile NatFem-ON ±6 °C that resulted in 100% mortality. The 25% to 75% quantile box depicts the average temperature (diamond) and the median temperature line. The bottom bars illustrate temperature ranges within the OTR that induce males (blue) or females (red), the ranges outside the OTR but within the VTR (gray), and the temperatures lower or higher than the most extreme values in all other profiles (black). Note that most temperatures of the NatFem-ON ±6 °C profile fell below the pivotal temperature (purple vertical line) and a substantial portion fell in the gray areas where development is retarded or in the black range of temperatures that may be lethal, perhaps explaining the high mortality of this treatment.
