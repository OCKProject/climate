   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Baseline thermal profiles recorded in the field (hourly) from a male-producing natural nest in Iowa (NatMale-IA in blue), from female-producing natural nests in Ontario (NatFem-ON in green) and Nebraska (NatFem-NE in brown), and female-producing profile (semiNatFem-IA in red) generated by adding 5 °C to each record from the NatMale-IA profile to simulate increased overall mean global temperature. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Comparison of excerpts of the hourly baseline profiles from panel (a) plus the most extreme ±6 °C affine-transformed profiles from Iowa (NatMale-IA ±6 °C in light blue and semiNatFem-IA ±6 °C in pink). (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Excerpts of the Iowa baseline profiles (NatMale-IA in blue and semiNatFem-IA in red) illustrating the full range of affine transformations aimed to increase thermal variance by approximately ±2 °C (purple lines), by ~±4 °C (green lines), and by ~±6 °C (orange lines). These excerpts depict how the transformations preserve the general shape of the original profiles (transformed profiles maintain the inflection points and the timing of the daily maxima and minima). Gray areas demarcate the optimal temperature range for development in Painted Turtles

   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) Sex ratios obtained in the lab from eggs incubated under the profiles recorded in field nests or affine-transformed as described in panels (c,d) above (see text for details), which were replicated in programmable incubators.

Abbreviations: Nat Male IA = male-producing profile recorded in a field nest in Iowa; semiNat Fem IA = semi-natural female-producing profile generated as described for panel (a) above. Nat Fem NE = profile recorded in a natural nest in Nebraska which produced 100% females in Nebraska but induced mostly males using eggs from an Iowa farm. Nat Fem ON = female-producing profile recorded in a natural nest in Ontario (Canada) which also produced 100% females using eggs from an Iowa farm. ORIG = original profiles; ±2 °C, ±4 °C, ±6 °C = amplitude of thermal variance added to original profiles by the affine transformations. M:F = number of males and females obtained in each lab experiment.
