<p id="Par21" class="p">The unidirectional feminization effect of a ±6 °C affine transformation was then tested using natural nest profiles that produced 100% females in a Nebraska Sandhills population and in an Algonquin Provincial Park population (Ontario, Canada), NatFem-NE and NatFem-ON respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,e</xref>). No 100%-female natural profile was available from Iowa because all natural and experimental nests monitored over multiple years (2006–2010) produced male-biased sex ratios (perhaps in response to relatively colder temperatures experienced during the nesting season over those years –  see Supplementary Information).
