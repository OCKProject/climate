<p id="Par20" class="p">The following thermal profiles were utilized (all incubation profiles are included in the Supplementary Information). First, we recorded hourly thermal profiles inside natural nests laid by Painted Turtles at an Iowa turtle farm using iButton dataloggers placed in the bottom, middle, and top of the egg chamber (two dataloggers per level), and documented their resulting sex ratios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Care was taken to carefully and quickly remove the eggs, maintaining the integrity of the egg chamber, placing the dataloggers, positioning the eggs back in their original orientation, and covering the nest with the original substrate. iButtons are small enough that their effect on nest temperature is negligible (as evidenced by the fact that the profiles recorded in the middle of the egg chamber produce identical sex ratios when replicated in the laboratory). We tested the predicted feminizing effect of a rising mean temperature if global gas emissions are not curtailed

 </sup>, by adding 5 °C to each recorded temperature of a natural profile that produced 100% males (Iowa natural male profile: NatMale-IA) which generated a semi-natural profile that induced 100% females (semiNatFem-IA) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). Because eggs incubated under these two incubation profiles produced the expected 100% males and 100% females (respectively) during three consecutive years when replicated in the lab, such that no sex ratio biases were detected that could be attributable to year-to-year differences in the source of eggs or incubator performance (Chi
