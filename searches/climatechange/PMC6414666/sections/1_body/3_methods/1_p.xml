 </disp-formula>where T is the temperature recorded every hour in a nest, M is the daily mean temperature of that nest, and F is a scalar factor. An F = 1.4 stretched the thermal profile by approximately ±2 °C, F = 1.8 by ~±4 °C, and F = 2.3 by ~±6 °C. This affine transformation preserves the shape of the thermal profiles by generally maintaining the inflection points and timing of daily maxima/minima (see Fig.
