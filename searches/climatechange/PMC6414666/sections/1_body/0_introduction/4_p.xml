<p id="Par5" class="p">Here we tested whether accentuated thermal fluctuations around natural nest profiles offset the negative impact that contemporary global warming might have on the persistence of TSD species, by examining embryonic development in the Painted Turtle (

 </sup>, which could have important ecological and evolutionary consequences provided that similar effects were experienced by nests in nature. Namely, if rising average temperature alone induces feminization of TSD turtles but global warming is accompanied by more marked thermal oscillations within natural nests that have a masculinizing effect, then these effects could counter each other, slowing down the feminization of TSD population, and thus decelerating the concomitant demographic collapse. However, natural nests experience more complex thermal oscillations than used in all previous experimental studies (Fig.

 </sup> remain unclear. Here we use a novel and ecologically-relevant experimental approach, replicating and modifying thermal profiles recorded in natural nests. We show that instead of having a moderating effect, increased thermal variation may accelerate the rate at which natural TSD turtle populations could become feminized by climate change. Our data revealed that larger oscillations alter the balance between embryonic development accrued above and below the pivotal temperature by altering the exposure of eggs to temperatures that vary in their potency to sustain development and to trigger male or female development. We also found that geographic populations differed in their responses to identical natural-nest incubation conditions. These interpopulation differences could have a potentially alleviating effect, provided they reflect heritable variation. But adaptive responses would only be possible if they are not precluded by the fragmentation of natural habitats or impeded by the speed at which contemporary global temperatures are changing. Our findings, if applicable to other TSD reptiles, including those that produce males at warmer temperatures, underscore the potentially devastating effect of climate change at a broader taxonomic scale than previously appreciated.
