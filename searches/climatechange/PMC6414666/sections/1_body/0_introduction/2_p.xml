 </sup>. Consequently, extinction risk escalates when feminization reaches levels that impair population growth, because extreme male scarcity limits reproduction and sex ratio bias promotes the loss of genetic variation. Such extreme feminization resulting from contemporary global warming has already been documented in sea turtle populations exposed to rising average temperatures

 </sup>, and their populations may be even more vulnerable to extinction because global warming induces masculinization, and female scarcity can induce demographic collapse faster than female excess. The effects of climate change can be complex, because the influence of skewed sex ratios on population dynamics may be mediated by the species’ mating system

Additional sources of thermal variation affect TSD taxa, such as in sea turtles whose nests may be deep enough to lack daily thermal variation, but which experience fluctuating temperatures associated with precipitation events that are also predicted to be altered by climate change
