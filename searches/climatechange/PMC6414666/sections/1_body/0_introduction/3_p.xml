<p id="Par4" class="p">The effects of temperature fluctuation remain enigmatic because experimental approaches so far have been restricted to using simplistic thermal profiles, such as uniform sinusoidal cycles or high/low alternating temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–m</xref>). These simplistic experiments do not capture the complexity of the incubation conditions found in nature, where diel fluctuations may not follow a uniform cycle and may include seasonal or sub-seasonal trends (Fig.
