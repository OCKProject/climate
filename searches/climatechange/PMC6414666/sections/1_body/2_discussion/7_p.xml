<p id="Par16" class="p">In conclusion, previous research using simplistic incubation conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) suggested that larger fluctuations in incubation temperature might counteract the detrimental effect that contemporary climate change could have on TSD turtles by triggering male development under warmer average temperatures

 </sup>. However, our study using ecologically-relevant experiments, underscores the perils for the persistence of TSD taxa associated with the lack of action to reduce contemporary greenhouse gas emissions to levels that lower or reverse projected climate change. First, higher average global temperatures as predicted for the year 2100 if no additional efforts are made to curtail gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway – RCP8.5)
