<p id="Par17" class="p">For Painted Turtles the drastic effects detected here are preventable only under aggressive mitigation scenarios (RCP2.6), while intermediate actions (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios) will increase average temperatures to levels that result in more moderate feminization. Importantly however, any climate change that increases the thermal variance in TSD turtle nests, even if the average temperature remains intact, could have a detrimental feminizing effect. Thus, the larger fluctuations expected to accompany global warming can have a synergistic effect and actually accelerate the rate of feminization of TSD turtle populations. This would put them at greater risk of extinction than they are already, a risk that exacerbates the effects of other factors such as habitat degradation and anthropogenic exploitation, which combined have rendered this charismatic lineage the most endangered vertebrate group on earth
