<p id="Par15" class="p">The interpopulation variation in the response to identical natural incubation conditions that we observed here may be of paramount importance. If such heterogeneity among populations is heritable (as has been reported for Painted Turtles
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>), the underlying genetic variation may permit the survival of some populations of TSD turtles that are able to produce males at high average global temperatures. Further, the male-biased sex ratios observed at the monitored field sites in Iowa during 2006â€“2010 indicate that colder spells within or between years at some nesting localities (see Supplementary Information) represent male-producing bouts that could also attenuate the overall feminizing trend of climate change at those locations. The same would be true for sea turtles that produce more males when precipitation events cool down nests, except that precipitation may become rarer at some sea turtle nesting sites with climate change

 </sup>, or if the thermal fluctuations induced by precipitation resemble those observed in our study and become feminizing. Male production at some locations could benefit other populations if males could disperse between localities. Unfortunately, species-level recovery from such surviving source populations (from which an influx of males or an influx of heritable thermosensitive variation could derive) may be impossible due to habitat fragmentation that prevents recolonization of areas of extirpation without human intervention, especially for highly endangered species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. Habitat fragmentation can also preclude populations from shifting their distributional ranges on their own to track optimal temperatures at higher latitudes. On the other hand, intraspecific variation in the response of the gene regulatory network controlling sexual development to incubation temperature exists in Painted Turtles

 </sup>. If heritable, such genetic diversity could also provide raw material for natural selection and consequently, for populations of TSD turtles to evolve adaptively to the challenges of climate change. Whether inter- or intra-population variation may have permitted TSD turtles to survive extinction during past episodes of climate change by fine-tuning their TSD mechanism or by evolving sex chromosomes
