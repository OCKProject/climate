<p id="Par12" class="p">This unidirectional pattern of sex reversal was further confirmed by our observations that the NatFem-NE profile (which produced 60% males using Iowa eggs) and the NatMale-IA profile (which produced 100% males using Iowa eggs) induced full feminization when stretched by ±6 °C (NatFem-NE ±6 °C and NatMale-IA ±6 °C treatments) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>), whereas stretching the female-producing profile from Ontario (NatFem-ON ±6 °C) caused 100% mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>). Given that the original NatFem-ON profile was characterized by a wider range of temperatures than the IA and NE profiles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>), the lethality of the NatFem-ON ±6 °C treatment suggests a limit to the thermal variation that is tolerable by developing embryos. This agrees with observations in other TSD turtles

 </sup>, echoing the concern that extreme temperatures imperil population viability via aggravated mortality. However, it should be noted that egg inviability was particularly high across all treatments that year (2017) for unknown reasons (Fig.
