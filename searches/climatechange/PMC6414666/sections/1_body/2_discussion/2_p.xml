<p id="Par11" class="p">Namely, we found that sexual development of embryos from the ‘stretched’ NatMale-IA and semiNatFem-IA profiles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>) was unaffected if the added variation was narrow (restricted to ±2 °C and ±4 °C; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>), whereas complete feminization was induced by wider fluctuations around otherwise male-producing conditions (NatMale-IA ±6 °C) but no reversal was observed around female-producing conditions (semiNatFem-IA ±6 °C; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>). These results resemble previous observations in which a milder simple fluctuation of ±3 °C around a mean of 26 °C or 31 °C had no effect on sexual development of Painted Turtles, but a wider fluctuation of ±5 °C induced sex reversal (and greater mortality around the 31 °C average)

 </sup>, indicating that these effects may be taxonomically widespread among TSD reptiles. Notice, however, that except for our present study, the oscillating profiles used in all previous experiments differed greatly from real nest profiles (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and thus failed to mimic the conditions currently experienced by natural populations, or those forecasted under climate change. Unfortunately, when using ecologically-relevant conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>), as we do here, only a feminizing effect was detected, suggesting that there may be no good news after all.
