<p id="Par14" class="p">Importantly, our observations also revealed profound differences that exist among geographically distant populations in their sex ratio response to identical thermal regimes encountered in nature. Such interpopulation variation in the sex ratios induced by identical incubation temperatures (i.e., their reaction norms) has been reported previously in turtles [examples reviewed in
