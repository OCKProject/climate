<p id="Par10" class="p">Our novel experimental approach represents the first ecologically-relevant test of the effects of increased thermal variance in wild nests (as predicted by climate change) on sex determination in TSD vertebrates, beyond the effect of rising mean temperature. We accomplished this by exposing developing embryos to various thermal profiles, some recorded directly within nests in the field and some modified using mathematical transformations. This range of conditions simulates not only increased average temperature but also accentuated fluctuations as predicted from climate change scenarios. Prior to our study, it remained untested whether thermal oscillations could mitigate the detrimental effects of rising global temperature, or exacerbate these effects such that we might expect faster collapse of TSD populations in the future. This knowledge gap remained because previous studies compared the effect of constant incubation temperatures to simplistic thermal fluctuations in the laboratory that differed greatly from natural nest conditions (Fig.

 </sup>, whereas the thermal oscillations used herein were based on real nest profiles (compare Figs

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–d</xref> with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b–m</xref>). Incubating eggs under thermal conditions modified by our mathematical transformation showed that the feminization of TSD turtles accelerates drastically as thermal fluctuations increase in natural nests, highlighting an unanticipated threat of climate change for TSD vertebrates.
