 <underline class="underline">U</underline>nits (wCTUs) for each profile (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). We observed that thermal oscillations alter the balance between the proportion of development that takes place at feminizing versus masculinizing temperatures by exposing embryos to values outside the viable thermal range (VTR, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) which contribute little or nil to development. This in turn alters how much of development is realized at temperatures within the VTR that vary in their potency to sustain development and in their potency to differentially induce male or female determination/differentiation (which can be overlapping processes in TSD taxa
