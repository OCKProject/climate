<p id="Par8" class="p">Next, because stretching the NatMale-IA and semiNatFem-IA profiles by ±6 °C caused unidirectional sex reversal (i.e. feminization and not masculinization), we examined the generality of this effect by testing whether adding ±6 °C to natural nest profiles that produced 100% females in the wild would also lack a sex reversal effect as for the semiNatFem-IA ±6 °C treatment. For this, we used a natural profile recorded from a population of Painted Turtles from the Nebraska Sandhills and one from a population from Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario (Canada), both of which produced exclusively females at those sites (NatFem-NE and NatFem-ON, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,e</xref>). Notably, we found that when using Iowa eggs, the Ontario NatFem-ON profile replicated in the lab induced 100% females, whereas the Nebraska NatFem-NE profile induced male-biased development (40% females) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>), demonstrating significant interpopulation differences in the responses to identical natural-nest incubation conditions. When the ±6 °C affine transformation was applied to these thermal profiles and Iowa eggs were incubated under those settings, the modified Nebraska profile (NatFem-NE ±6 °C) elicited full feminization just as the NatMale-IA ±6 °C treatment did, whereas the modified Ontario profile (NatFem-ON ±6 °C) resulted in 100% embryonic mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>).
