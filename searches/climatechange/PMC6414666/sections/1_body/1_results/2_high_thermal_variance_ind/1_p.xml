<p id="Par7" class="p">These NatMale-IA and semiNatFem-IA profiles were then modified by an affine mathematical transformation that increased the variance of the profile (by approximately ±2 °C, ±4 °C, ±6 °C) while preserving its general shape (maintaining, in general, the inflection points and timing of daily maxima/minima – see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b–d</xref>). Exposing eggs to such modified incubation conditions had mixed results depending on the amplitude of the oscillations. First, we found that the tighter fluctuations of ±2 °C and ±4 °C around both the male-producing (NatMale-IA) and female-producing (semiNatFem-IA) profiles, had virtually no effect, such that the observed sex ratios matched the expected sex ratios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>). However, wider fluctuations of ±6 °C around the male-producing natural profile (NatMale-IA ±6 °C) feminized all embryos, whereas embryos from the semiNatFem-IA ±6 °C treatment were virtually unaffected and developed as females (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>).
