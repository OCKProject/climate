 </sup>, eggs incubated in the lab produced 100% females (semiNatFem-IA profile in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). An Iowa all-female natural profile was not used because all natural and experimental nests monitored in Iowa over multiple years (2006–2010) produced male-biased sex ratios (likely due to the relatively colder temperatures experienced during the nesting season at the monitored locations over those years – see Supplementary Information).
