<italic>Bitten month</italic> is the month where the victim experienced a snakebite.

Note that the 13th <italic>bitten month</italic> corresponds to the 1st <italic>survey month</italic>, as survey reported snakebite data for the preceding 12&#x02009;months.</p><p>Average meteorological parameters in a given bitten month represent the mean value across all the locations that reported snakebites in a given bitten month (e.g. average rainfall in January 2012 represents the mean rainfall over all the locations that reported a snakebite in January 2012).</p></sec><sec><title>Data sources</title><sec><title>Epidemiological data</title><p>An island-wide community-based National Snakebite Survey was conducted between August 2012 and June 2013.<xref rid="dyy188-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The study sampled about 1% of the Sri Lankan population. Sri Lanka has 9 provinces and 25 districts. The survey design used multistage cluster sampling, with 125 clusters sampled from each province and clusters allocated to districts within each province in proportion to the population size of each district. In each cluster, 40 consecutive households were sampled from a random initial household on the electoral register. In the event of non-response (nobody in the household after two visits), the next house on the electoral register was selected. Data were collected by conducting face-to-face interviews with an adult household member. All snakebite events occurring in the sampled households during the year preceding the date of survey were recorded along with the date of each snakebite.</p></sec><sec><title>Meteorological measurements of weather</title><p>Average meteorological measurements in each bitten month were obtained from the Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka. Meteorological measurements included rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity and maximum relative humidity. Meteorological measurements (i.e. weather data) pertaining to each location and time (i.e. bitten location and month) were then attached to each individual bite report. We then calculated the average meteorological measurements for each bitten month as the average value reported in all the bitten locations in a particular bitten month and used these averaged meteorological values in each bitten month as explanatory variables for the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The National Snakebite Survey in Sri Lanka was conducted over 11 consecutive months. Any snakebite experienced by any household member within the year preceding the date of interview was recorded in the survey. Therefore, the survey included snakebite events occurring between August 2011 and June 2013 (i.e. 23&#x02009;months). We call the month in which the survey was carried out the <italic>survey month</italic> and the month in which the snakebite occurred the <italic>bitten month</italic>. The number of snakebites recorded in each bitten month is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online.</p><sec><title>Accounting for survey methodology</title><p>The number of snakebites recorded in each bitten month depends on both the risk of snakebite and the effective sample size for the given month. The effective sample size for a given month in turn depends on the survey effort in that month (i.e. number sampled in a given month) and the number of survey months that contributed snakebite records to a particular bitten month. Survey effort also varied over time due to the variation in population density and the extent of the geographical area surveyed in a particular month (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). Note that more than 1 survey month can contribute snakebite records to a particular bitten month. For example, only the survey month August 2012 provided records of snakebites in the bitten month August 2011, whereas the August and September 2012 surveys both contributed to the number of snakebite records for the bitten month September 2011. For the data analysis, the number of snakebites recorded in each bitten month was further disaggregated across each of the contributing survey months so that the response variable was the number of bites recorded at each combination of bitten month and survey month, whilst survey effort in each survey month was considered as an offset. Our data include 22 snakebites that occurred during the period of 23 bitten months but with recall duration more than 12&#x02009;months. Therefore, our study had 158 combinations of bitten and survey months (i.e. 11 bites occurring in the same survey month, 125 bites pertaining to the preceding 12&#x02009;months and 22 bites that occurred more than 12&#x02009;months before the survey month but within the 23 bitten months).</p></sec><sec><title>Accounting for recall bias</title><p>The survey recorded snakebite events that occurred throughout the year preceding the date of survey, so the number of recorded snakebites in any bitten month would be affected by recall bias. For this reason, the statistical model included the time difference between survey month and bitten month as a log-linear effect, corresponding to an exponentially decaying recall power.</p></sec><sec><title>Modelling snakebite events</title><p>The National Snakebite Survey reported 695 snakebite events from a sample of 165&#x02009;665 individuals. Twenty snakebite events were removed during data cleaning due to missing values. We fitted a Poisson log-linear model to the number, <italic>Y</italic><sub>s</sub><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, of snakebites occurring in each bitten-survey month, with expected numbers of bites:

The following terms were considered for inclusion in the exposure vector: bitten month <italic>t</italic>, corresponding to a log-linear trend over the study period; sine and cosine functions with periodicities of 12, 6, 4 and 3&#x02009;months to investigate seasonal effects; average values of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity and rainfall with time-lags of 0, 1, 2 and 3&#x02009;months. All of the meteorological variables were de-seasonalized using sine and cosine functions to avoid confounding of weather effects with other, unrecorded seasonally varying factors. We refer to these de-seasonalized series as <italic>weather anomalies.</italic></p><p>Forward variable selection with log-likelihood ratio assessment was used to determine which explanatory variables should be included in the exposure vector <italic>e<sub>t</sub></italic>. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the standard Normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters, and validated using a bootstrap method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Material</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). Goodness of fit of the model was assessed by the ratio between residual deviance and residual degrees of freedom and by residual plots. All computations used the R programming language version 3.2.3.<xref rid="dyy188-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>The expected numbers of reported snakebites in any month, after adjusting for recall bias for each bitten-survey month, were estimated from the fitted log-linear model and used to calculate monthly snakebite estimates and 95% CIs for the whole country. Monthly snakebite estimates were then decomposed into seasonal and weather-related components, and predictions made under future climate scenarios. The only weather-related explanatory variable included in the fitted log- linear model was relative humidity. We used the association between relative humidity and temperature to predict snakebite burden under scenarios corresponding to changes in temperature with rainfall fixed at current levels. Median monthly average levels of maximum relative humidity and maximum temperature over the study period were 89% and 31&#x000b0;C, respectively. We would expect approximately a 2.5% reduction in humidity if the temperature were to increase by 0.5&#x000b0;C, holding all other environmental conditions fixed.<xref rid="dyy188-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> We therefore predicted the country-wide monthly seasonal snakebite incidence under this scenario, i.e. for an average relative-humidity anomaly of &#x02013;2.5%, to reflect a 0.5&#x000b0;C increase in the mean annual temperature in the country.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval for the National Snakebite Survey was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya.

Snakebites showed a complex seasonal pattern independently of the seasonal weather anomalies. The highest snakebite incidence was observed during the period November&#x02013;December, with smaller peaks in March&#x02013;May and August. Under average weather conditions, Sri Lanka can expect monthly snakebite incidence of 46 bites per 100&#x02009;000 population per month on average, increasing to 71 bites per 100&#x02009;000 during November&#x02013;December. Periods of lower-than-expected relative-humidity levels lead to higher-than-expected snakebite incidence and vice versa. Our estimated seasonal snakebite peaks are compatible with previous local data.<xref rid="dyy188-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Similar seasonal patterns have also been observed in other countries in the region.<xref rid="dyy188-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29&#x02013;32</sup></xref></p><p>Regular seasonal weather patterns (i.e. rainfall, temperature and humidity) are closely associated with rotational movement of the Earth around the Sun. We therefore used harmonic mathematical functions to represent annual, biannual, quarterly and three-monthly regular components of variation in incidence. All the variables representing weather conditions were considered for inclusion in the model as anomalies, i.e. departures from expectation for the month in question, again using harmonic mathematical functions to describe their expected patterns of seasonal variation. This use of anomalies, rather than actual values, of weather-related variables enabled us to evaluate the effects of weather conditions independently of other seasonally varying factors with which they would otherwise have been confounded.<xref rid="dyy188-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Therefore, the purely seasonal effects in the model (sine and cosine terms) can be considered as proxies for seasonally varying <italic>expected</italic> weather and agricultural patterns, and <italic>weather anomaly</italic> effects as weather effects that cannot be explained by the purely seasonal pattern. After accounting for the purely seasonal weather pattern, snakebites showed association with maximum ambient relative humidity, but not with rainfall or temperature.<xref rid="dyy188-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Monthly average maximum relative humidity showed the lowest coefficient of variation among the meteorological variables and exhibited more pronounced changes over time than either temperature or rainfall. Thus, maximum relative humidity can be considered as a better representative of relevant monthly weather conditions in our study. A positive correlation between rainfall and snakebite has been shown in a number of studies,<xref rid="dyy188-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36&#x02013;38</sup></xref> but it is possible that these reported correlations could be due to the rainfall acting as a proxy for the combined effects of unmeasured social and environmental factors.</p><p>Lower-than-expected maximum humidity levels in a given month were associated with higher numbers of snakebites and vice versa. This was clearly seen, e.g., in a comparison between May 2012 and May 2013, where estimated incidence was higher and lower, respectively, than the expected incidence according to the pure seasonal pattern. Previous literature has shown that certain snake species can be encountered more frequently on lower humid days and dry seasons, and high snake activity patterns may predispose to snakebites.<xref rid="dyy188-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> During dry periods, Sri Lanka experiences high temperature and low rainfall, leading to low relative humid environmental conditions.

The &#x02018;Maha&#x02019; season is the main agricultural season in the country, starting during November&#x02013;December. This explains the associated high snakebite burden during this time compared with the much lower incidence in the &#x02018;Yala&#x02019; season that starts around May, when agricultural activities are largely confined to areas fed with irrigated water. On the other hand, heavy physical farming activities, leading to greater human interaction with the environment, are usually over before the onset of heavy rains during the agricultural seasons and a correspondingly low snakebite incidence can be observed during the mid-seasons. Subsequently, harvesting starts after the heavy rains and high snakebite incidence can again be observed towards the end of farming seasons.<xref rid="dyy188-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyy188-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Lower relative-humidity levels are expected at the beginning and end of each agricultural season compared with mid-season when rainfall is generally heaviest, and this is reflected in the estimated snakebite pattern during an agricultural season.

The National Snakebite Survey captured the snakebite events that occurred in the preceding year, and it could be anticipated that recorded bitten numbers will suffer from recall bias. We addressed this in our analysis by an exponentially decaying function of recall duration. Our analysis showed a significant and substantial recall effect, and our final monthly snakebite estimates were derived after correcting for this. A particular consequence of recall bias is that the true burden of snakebite in Sri Lanka is substantially greater than would be deduced simply from the number of snakebites recorded during the survey. This explains why a previous report based on a purely spatial analysis<xref rid="dyy188-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> gave the estimated total number of snakebites occurring in Sri Lanka as 80&#x02009;000 bites per year, whereas the present analysis that accounts for recall bias estimates the annual snakebite burden to be approximately 110&#x02009;000 under expected weather conditions, rising to 120&#x02009;000 in years such as 2012, when humidity is lower than expectations.</p><p>The National Snakebite Survey was conducted over 11&#x02009;months. Survey effort varied considerably from month to month due to the variation in population density in the surveyed areas as well as the geographical extent surveyed during a month. Similarly, the effective sample size for each bitten month varied from month to month. These features of the survey methodology were addressed by considering the number of bites pertaining to each combination of bitten month and survey month as the response variable in a log-linear model that included an offset to represent the fraction of population sampled during each survey month. This allowed us to estimate the risk of snakebites at the national level in each bitten month.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our estimates are limited to inference on variation in snakebite incidence over a relatively short period of 23&#x02009;months. Average monthly dew point would have been a better indicator of variation in monthly humidity than the average relative humidity, but the relevant data could not be obtained for the analysis. Our predictions of the effect of increasing temperature in snakebite incidence used the physical relationship between temperature and relative humidity, and the change in relative-humidity level resulting from an increase in temperature was calculated assuming other environmental conditions are fixed. In other words, we estimated the effect of global climate change based purely on a change in expected temperature and no change to rainfall. However, climate-change effects can only be explained fully by considering changes in ecosystems, population growth, land use, urbanization and access to food and water.<xref rid="dyy188-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The aim of the present study has been to evaluate temporal variation in snakebite burden at the national level.
