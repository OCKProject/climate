  <p class="p">Decomposed snakebite incidence plot. Dotted line indicates the estimated snakebite incidence without seasonal and weather effects (i.e. intercept of the fitted model). Dashed line indicates the seasonal variation in snakebite incidence without the weather effect (i.e. intercept and harmonic functions of the fitted model). Solid line indicates the estimated snakebite incidence for the study period including seasonal and weather effects (i.e. full model).</p>
