<p class="p">The expected numbers of reported snakebites in any month, after adjusting for recall bias for each bitten-survey month, were estimated from the fitted log-linear model and used to calculate monthly snakebite estimates and 95% CIs for the whole country. Monthly snakebite estimates were then decomposed into seasonal and weather-related components, and predictions made under future climate scenarios. The only weather-related explanatory variable included in the fitted log- linear model was relative humidity. We used the association between relative humidity and temperature to predict snakebite burden under scenarios corresponding to changes in temperature with rainfall fixed at current levels. Median monthly average levels of maximum relative humidity and maximum temperature over the study period were 89% and 31°C, respectively. We would expect approximately a 2.5% reduction in humidity if the temperature were to increase by 0.5°C, holding all other environmental conditions fixed.
