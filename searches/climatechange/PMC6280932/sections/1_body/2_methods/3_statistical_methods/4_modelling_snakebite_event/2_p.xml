 </italic> is the number of people sampled in survey month 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> divided by the total population of Sri Lanka. The following terms were considered for inclusion in the exposure vector: bitten month 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>, corresponding to a log-linear trend over the study period; sine and cosine functions with periodicities of 12, 6, 4 and 3 months to investigate seasonal effects; average values of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity and rainfall with time-lags of 0, 1, 2 and 3 months. All of the meteorological variables were de-seasonalized using sine and cosine functions to avoid confounding of weather effects with other, unrecorded seasonally varying factors. We refer to these de-seasonalized series as 
 <italic class="italic">weather anomalies.</italic>
