<p class="p">The number of snakebites recorded in each bitten month depends on both the risk of snakebite and the effective sample size for the given month. The effective sample size for a given month in turn depends on the survey effort in that month (i.e. number sampled in a given month) and the number of survey months that contributed snakebite records to a particular bitten month. Survey effort also varied over time due to the variation in population density and the extent of the geographical area surveyed in a particular month (

For example, only the survey month August 2012 provided records of snakebites in the bitten month August 2011, whereas the August and September 2012 surveys both contributed to the number of snakebite records for the bitten month September 2011. For the data analysis, the number of snakebites recorded in each bitten month was further disaggregated across each of the contributing survey months so that the response variable was the number of bites recorded at each combination of bitten month and survey month, whilst survey effort in each survey month was considered as an offset. Our data include 22 snakebites that occurred during the period of 23 bitten months but with recall duration more than 12 months. Therefore, our study had 158 combinations of bitten and survey months (i.e. 11 bites occurring in the same survey month, 125 bites pertaining to the preceding 12 months and 22 bites that occurred more than 12 months before the survey month but within the 23 bitten months).
