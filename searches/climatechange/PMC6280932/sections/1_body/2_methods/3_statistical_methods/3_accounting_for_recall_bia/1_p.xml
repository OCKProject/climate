<p class="p">The survey recorded snakebite events that occurred throughout the year preceding the date of survey, so the number of recorded snakebites in any bitten month would be affected by recall bias. For this reason, the statistical model included the time difference between survey month and bitten month as a log-linear effect, corresponding to an exponentially decaying recall power.</p>
