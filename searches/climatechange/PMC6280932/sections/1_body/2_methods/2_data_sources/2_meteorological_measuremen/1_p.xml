<p class="p">Average meteorological measurements in each bitten month were obtained from the Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka. Meteorological measurements included rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity and maximum relative humidity. Meteorological measurements (i.e. weather data) pertaining to each location and time (i.e. bitten location and month) were then attached to each individual bite report. We then calculated the average meteorological measurements for each bitten month as the average value reported in all the bitten locations in a particular bitten month and used these averaged meteorological values in each bitten month as explanatory variables for the analysis.</p>
