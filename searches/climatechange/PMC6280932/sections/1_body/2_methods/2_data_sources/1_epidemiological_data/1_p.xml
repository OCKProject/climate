<p class="p">An island-wide community-based National Snakebite Survey was conducted between August 2012 and June 2013.

  <sup class="sup">1</sup>
 </xref> The study sampled about 1% of the Sri Lankan population. Sri Lanka has 9 provinces and 25 districts. The survey design used multistage cluster sampling, with 125 clusters sampled from each province and clusters allocated to districts within each province in proportion to the population size of each district. In each cluster, 40 consecutive households were sampled from a random initial household on the electoral register. In the event of non-response (nobody in the household after two visits), the next house on the electoral register was selected. Data were collected by conducting face-to-face interviews with an adult household member. All snakebite events occurring in the sampled households during the year preceding the date of survey were recorded along with the date of each snakebite.
