<p class="p">Global climate change is likely to have adverse effects on health during the twenty-first century, especially in developing countries with low income. Increasing incidences in a number of food-borne, water-borne and vector-borne diseases have been recognized, but snakebite, which is a disease of poverty, has not been emphasized.
