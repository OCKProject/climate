<p class="p">Determining the geographical variation of snakebites provides useful information by identifying high-risk areas. This helps policy makers to target preventive measures and to allocate resources efficiently at the local level. Understanding the seasonal variation in snakebite incidence is also important to determine resource allocation at the operational level, e.g. the distribution of anti-venom based on seasonal requirements and deployment of targeted preventive measures.

 </xref> Geographical variation in snakebite incidence has been studied in Sri Lanka, but temporal snakebite patterns have not been evaluated. In this paper, we analyse the seasonal pattern of snakebite incidence and show the possible effect of global climate change on snakebite incidence in Sri Lanka during the next 25–50 years. Our methodology highlights a general approach to addressing the effects of variable survey effort and recall bias associated with epidemiological surveys of this kind.
