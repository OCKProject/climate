<p class="p">Snakebites showed a seasonal pattern and an independent association with maximum relative-humidity anomaly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyy188-F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). According to the pure snakebite seasonal pattern, the highest expected snakebite incidence occurs during November–December, followed by March–May and August, whilst the lowest occurs during June–July, followed by October. The highest and lowest respective snakebite incidences are 70.7 (95% CI: 57.3–87.2) and 31.9 (95% CI: 23.5–43.3) per 100 000, whilst the overall monthly incidence is 45.7 (95% CI: 35.4–59.0). Lower-than-expected maximum humidity levels contribute to an increase in snakebite incidence and vice versa. For instance, expected snakebite incidences for May 2012 and May 2013 are 70.4 (95% CI: 54.2–91.5) and 32.9 (95% CI: 21.1–51.2) per 100 000, respectively, due to the differences in relative-humidity levels (i.e. –3.588 and 3.404, respectively) in these 2 months (
