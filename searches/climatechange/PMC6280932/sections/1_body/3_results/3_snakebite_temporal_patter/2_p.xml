<p class="p">Our model predicts the total number of snakebites in Sri Lanka during the calendar year 2012 to have been 119 000 (95% CI: 103 000–134 000) after accounting for recall bias and survey effort. Had there been no deviations from expectation in the seasonal weather patterns, i.e. zero anomaly in the maximum relative-humidity levels, during 2012, the predicted number would have been 110 000 (95% CI: 95 000–124 000).</p>
