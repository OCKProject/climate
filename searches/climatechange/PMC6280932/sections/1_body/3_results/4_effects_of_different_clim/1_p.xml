<p class="p">According to our model, a 1% reduction in maximum relative humidity at all times of the year holding rainfall fixed at current levels will increase snakebites by an estimated 11.5% (95% CI: 4.1–19.4). Similarly, a 2.5% reduction in maximum relative humidity, corresponding to a 0.5°C increase in maximum temperature levels, will increase snakebites by 31.3% (95% CI: 10.7–55.7). Under the projection of a 0.5°C increase in maximum temperature levels nationwide, these results imply the following. First, the expected annual snakebite burden will increase to 144 000 (95% CI: 122 000–166 000). Second, the incidence per 100 000 will rise to 92.8 (95% CI: 72.0–119.6) in November, the month of highest risk, and to 41.9 (95% CI: 31.8–55.3) in June, the month of lowest incidence. This will result in an overall monthly incidence of 60.0 (95% CI: 44.5–81.0) (
