<p class="p">Reported monthly snakebites showed a complex seasonal pattern, with contributions from sine–cosine pairs at 12-, 6-, 4- and 3-month periodicities. They also showed associations with maximum relative-humidity anomalies and with recall duration, i.e. the number of months between bitten month and survey month. The expected number of snakebites was higher in months with lower-than-expected average maximum relative humidity. The expected number of 
 <italic class="italic">reported</italic> snakebites decreased with increasing recall duration; the estimated snakebite recall probabilities for recall durations 3, 6 and 12 months were 0.79, 0.62 and 0.39, respectively.
