<p class="p">The fitted log-linear model for the recorded monthly numbers of snakebites is summarized in 
 <xref rid="dyy188-T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Adequacy of the fitted model was assessed using the deviance statistic, a residual vs fitted value plot and an autocorrelation plot. Residual deviance of the model was 146.56 with residual degrees of freedom 147; the associated chi-squared (generalized likelihood ratio) goodness-of-fit test gave no evidence of over-dispersion relative to the assumed Poisson distribution (
