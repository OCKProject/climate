<p class="p">In conclusion, we have shown seasonal variation in snakebite incidence in Sri Lanka, an independent adverse effect of low relative-humidity level and a potential increase in snakebite burden due to changes in global climate. These findings can inform healthcare decision-making at the national level. Our methodology for addressing recall bias and month-to-month variation in survey effort can be implemented in any generalized linear modelling software and is applicable to any epidemiological survey in which these features appear.</p>
