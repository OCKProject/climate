<p class="p">Global climate-change models have projected that Sri Lanka will experience an increase of about 1.0–2.0°C in its maximum temperature levels by 2100 under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 scenarios. Accordingly, we can expect a 0.5°C increase in maximum temperature levels over the next 25–50 years.

 </xref> According to the fitted model, snakebite burden will escalate along with the increasing maximum temperature levels, and we should expect a nationwide increase of snakebites by 31% per calendar year over the next 25–50 years. Either homogenous or heterogeneous temperature increases over a year under global climate change will increase the national burden of snakebite to a similar extent. Increasing temperature will cause expansion of dry seasons and the drying-up of water sources, tanks and rivers. These changes affect snake ecosystems and the associated reduction in humidity levels will lead to further increase in snakebites.
