<p class="p">The National Snakebite Survey was conducted over 11â€‰months. Survey effort varied considerably from month to month due to the variation in population density in the surveyed areas as well as the geographical extent surveyed during a month. Similarly, the effective sample size for each bitten month varied from month to month. These features of the survey methodology were addressed by considering the number of bites pertaining to each combination of bitten month and survey month as the response variable in a log-linear model that included an offset to represent the fraction of population sampled during each survey month. This allowed us to estimate the risk of snakebites at the national level in each bitten month.</p>
