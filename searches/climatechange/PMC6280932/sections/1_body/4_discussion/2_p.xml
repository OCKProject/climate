<p class="p">Regular seasonal weather patterns (i.e. rainfall, temperature and humidity) are closely associated with rotational movement of the Earth around the Sun. We therefore used harmonic mathematical functions to represent annual, biannual, quarterly and three-monthly regular components of variation in incidence. All the variables representing weather conditions were considered for inclusion in the model as anomalies, i.e. departures from expectation for the month in question, again using harmonic mathematical functions to describe their expected patterns of seasonal variation. This use of anomalies, rather than actual values, of weather-related variables enabled us to evaluate the effects of weather conditions independently of other seasonally varying factors with which they would otherwise have been confounded.

 </xref> Monthly average maximum relative humidity showed the lowest coefficient of variation among the meteorological variables and exhibited more pronounced changes over time than either temperature or rainfall. Thus, maximum relative humidity can be considered as a better representative of relevant monthly weather conditions in our study. A positive correlation between rainfall and snakebite has been shown in a number of studies,
