 </xref> Although snakebite events are significant events, still it is possible that victims and family members will forget the event. The National Snakebite Survey captured the snakebite events that occurred in the preceding year, and it could be anticipated that recorded bitten numbers will suffer from recall bias. We addressed this in our analysis by an exponentially decaying function of recall duration. Our analysis showed a significant and substantial recall effect, and our final monthly snakebite estimates were derived after correcting for this. A particular consequence of recall bias is that the true burden of snakebite in Sri Lanka is substantially greater than would be deduced simply from the number of snakebites recorded during the survey. This explains why a previous report based on a purely spatial analysis
