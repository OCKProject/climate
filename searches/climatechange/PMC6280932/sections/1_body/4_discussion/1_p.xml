<p class="p">The National Snakebite Survey showed clear seasonal variation in snakebite incidence. Snakebites showed a complex seasonal pattern independently of the seasonal weather anomalies. The highest snakebite incidence was observed during the period November–December, with smaller peaks in March–May and August. Under average weather conditions, Sri Lanka can expect monthly snakebite incidence of 46 bites per 100 000 population per month on average, increasing to 71 bites per 100 000 during November–December. Periods of lower-than-expected relative-humidity levels lead to higher-than-expected snakebite incidence and vice versa. Our estimated seasonal snakebite peaks are compatible with previous local data.
