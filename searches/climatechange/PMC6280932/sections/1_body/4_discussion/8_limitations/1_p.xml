<p class="p">Our estimates are limited to inference on variation in snakebite incidence over a relatively short period of 23â€‰months. Average monthly dew point would have been a better indicator of variation in monthly humidity than the average relative humidity, but the relevant data could not be obtained for the analysis. Our predictions of the effect of increasing temperature in snakebite incidence used the physical relationship between temperature and relative humidity, and the change in relative-humidity level resulting from an increase in temperature was calculated assuming other environmental conditions are fixed. In other words, we estimated the effect of global climate change based purely on a change in expected temperature and no change to rainfall. However, climate-change effects can only be explained fully by considering changes in ecosystems, population growth, land use, urbanization and access to food and water.

 </xref> The aim of the present study has been to evaluate temporal variation in snakebite burden at the national level. We already know that snakebite burden exhibits spatial variation.

 </xref> Our preliminary investigations suggest that local patterns of temporal variation in snakebite burden also vary across the country. A likely contributory factor to this is that monsoon seasons occur at different times of the year in the different parts of the country. We intend to investigate this, and other aspects of spatio-temporal interaction, in a future study.
