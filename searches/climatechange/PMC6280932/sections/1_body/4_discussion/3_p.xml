<p class="p">Lower-than-expected maximum humidity levels in a given month were associated with higher numbers of snakebites and vice versa. This was clearly seen, e.g., in a comparison between May 2012 and May 2013, where estimated incidence was higher and lower, respectively, than the expected incidence according to the pure seasonal pattern. Previous literature has shown that certain snake species can be encountered more frequently on lower humid days and dry seasons, and high snake activity patterns may predispose to snakebites.

 </xref> During dry periods, Sri Lanka experiences high temperature and low rainfall, leading to low relative humid environmental conditions. More snakebites can be expected during such dry periods. A similar observation has been made in Costa Rica (Latin America), where more snakebites have been recorded in high-temperature and low-rainfall conditions.
