<p id="Par7" class="p">Linear mixed models showed that change in population density (ΔPopulation) had strong and significant effects—in the predicted directions—on both ΔCSTI (

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). Conversely, while climatic predictors had significant effects on ΔCTI and ΔCDTI, the effects were relatively weak and opposite in direction to those predicted. Linear mixed models showed that the relationship between ΔTemperature and ΔCTI was significant only when controlling for changes in disturbance-related indices (i.e., ΔCDI and ΔCSTI; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.011; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), with greater temperature increases associated with reductions in CTI. ΔCDTI tended to be higher (less negative) in areas with greater increases in the SPEI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), and this relationship was non-significant when controlling for changes in disturbance-related indices (i.e., ΔCDI and ΔCSTI;

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>).
