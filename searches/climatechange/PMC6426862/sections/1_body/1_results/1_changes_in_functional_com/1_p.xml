<p id="Par6" class="p">Before calculating community-level functional composition indices, scores across taxa were standardized to a common scale (0–1; see Methods, Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), such that the magnitudes of change in the four indices (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) can be directly compared. The dominant temporal change was a shift toward more disturbance-adapted communities, with 92% of cells (25 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) showing an increase in the community disturbance index (mean ΔCDI = 0.13; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). In comparison, we found clear but weaker trends toward communities composed of less shade-tolerant and less drought-tolerant species: 77% of cells showed a decrease in the community shade tolerance index (mean ΔCSTI was −0.06; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) and 77% of cells also showed a decrease in the community drought tolerance index (mean ΔCDTI = −0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). In contrast, the community temperature index (ΔCTI) showed no clear trend on average, with a mean ΔCTI of 0.01 and high variance, including some grid cells with either strong decreases or increases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>).
