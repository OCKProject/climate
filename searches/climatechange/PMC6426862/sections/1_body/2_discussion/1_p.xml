<p id="Par8" class="p">These results point to a dominant role of anthropogenic disturbances underlying forest compositional changes during recent centuries in these northern temperate forests. Disturbance-related adaptations of different taxa were captured in two indices, one focused on well-established shade tolerance scores, CSTI

 </sup>, thought to capture expected responses to severe disturbances (e.g., clear-cut logging, anthropogenic fire). The other index (CDI) was developed specifically for this study to capture expected responses to a wider range of disturbance severities (e.g., selective logging; see Methods, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This CDI showed the strongest temporal changes, involving increases for a broad spectrum of disturbance-adapted taxa (e.g., early-successional

 <italic class="italic">Betula papyrifera</italic>, as well as more shade-tolerant but logging-favored 
 <italic class="italic">Acer</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Abies balsamea</italic>) at the expense of long-lived late-successional taxa (

 <italic class="italic">Tsuga canadensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus grandifolia</italic>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The CSTI showed less pronounced changes, mostly linked to increases in early-successional deciduous taxa (
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Betula papyrifera</italic>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). These results are consistent with similar land-use-driven shifts toward more disturbance-adapted and less shade-tolerant taxa in recent centuries found for portions of northeastern North America further to the south
