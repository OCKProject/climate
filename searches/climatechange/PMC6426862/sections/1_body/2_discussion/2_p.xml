 </sup>, and as predicted our results showed a shift toward less drought-tolerant communities. However, the magnitude of such changes was not correlated with changes in moisture, and the shift in the average CDTI may have been a correlate of disturbance-driven changes. Taxon-level affinities with disturbance, light and drought were correlated to different degrees (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), and changes in CDTI were significantly affected by changes in the disturbance-related indices CSTI and CDI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). ΔCDI and ΔCSTI were both negatively correlated with ΔCDTI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), mainly due to increases of the disturbance-adapted and drought-intolerant

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Increased CTI was associated with increased CDI due to increases of disturbance- and warm-adapted
