 </sup>, could also have played a role in the observed shift toward more disturbance-adapted tree communities. We are, however, confident in attributing past forest changes to the direct effects of anthropogenic disturbance rather than indirect effects of climate change via increased natural disturbance. First, fire frequency has actually declined in this region due to increased moisture

 </sup> as well as efficient fire suppression since the mid-twentieth century

 </sup>. Second, while insect outbreaks have occurred cyclically during the twentieth century (principally

 </sup> and 
 <italic class="italic">Malacosoma disstria</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>), there is no indication of an increased outbreak frequency

 </sup>. In addition, the tree species most affected by these defoliators (
 <italic class="italic">Abies balsamea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Populus tremuloides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Acer saccharum</italic>) are among the species that actually showed the strongest increases over time in our study area (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). These considerations, along with the significant correlation between change in population density and both ΔCSTI and ΔCDI, provide clear evidence of an overriding influence of land-use-driven disturbances on long-term changes in the composition of forests in southern Québec.
