<p id="Par11" class="p">Our results have important implications for understanding forest dynamics in an era of rapid global changes. First, changes in successional processes induced by disturbance represent more powerful drivers of forest dynamics compared to direct effect of climate change at the temporal scale of a century. Given ongoing changes in disturbance regimes that can be mediated by both land use

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. We found evidence of disturbance-induced compositional changes that countered the direction of expected warming-induced dynamics (e.g., increases in less warm-adapted taxa) despite the clear trend of increasing temperatures during the last century

 </sup>. To the extent that these changes were driven by anthropogenic disturbance, this may help explain the frequently observed lags in responses of tree communities to recent warming

 </sup>. At the same time, we found some disturbance impacts that appear to favor the same taxa expected to increase with greater moisture (e.g., increases in less drought-adapted taxa), thus potentially accelerating this aspect of climate-induced changes. However, the shift we observed towards less drought-tolerant tree communities took place during one of the wettest periods of the last five centuries in northeastern North America
