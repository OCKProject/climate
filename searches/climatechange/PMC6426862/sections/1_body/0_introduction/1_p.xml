  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>, but empirical tests face several challenges. First, the time scale of available historical data might constrain our ability to detect the effects of particular global change drivers. For example, some studies that cover the past 40–50 years capture a period of more pronounced warming than land-use change and thus are perhaps more likely to detect climate change impacts
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. Second, changes that are ascribed to one driver such as climate warming (e.g., elevational distribution shifts) might in fact, upon closer examination, be more likely explained by a different factor such as change in land use
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. This is especially problematic for the warming of the twentieth century, which has been paralleled by major changes in anthropogenic disturbance regimes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>, such that these two drivers of ecosystem dynamics can mask or modify each other’s effects. Finally, the influence of “climate” is often assessed by focusing only on temperature, while changes in precipitation can have equally large ecological impacts
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. Clearly, there is a pressing need for explicit empirical tests of the influence of changes in temperature, precipitation and disturbance regimes on ecological communities across broad spatial and temporal scales.
