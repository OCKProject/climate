 </sup>. Anthropogenic disturbances imposed by land uses come in different forms (e.g., agricultural clearing, logging, anthropogenic fires), which collectively influence forest dynamics by conferring advantages to disturbance-adapted, early-successional, short-lived and fast-growing tree species, which over a period of decades or centuries are successively replaced by late-successional, long-lived, shade-tolerant species
