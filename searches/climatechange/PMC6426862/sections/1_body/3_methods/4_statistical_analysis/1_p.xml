 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) as a random factor in all models. Spatial autocorrelation was taken into account within cluster groups using an exponential spatial correlation structure constructed with the corExp function contained in the nlme package

 </sup>. We first tested for individual effects of potential predictors on community indices: we tested effects of ΔTemperature on ΔCTI, of ΔSPEI on ΔCDTI and of ΔPopulation on both ΔCSTI and ΔCDI. Second, because taxon-level affinities with disturbance, light and drought were correlated to some degree (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), we tested effects of potential predictors after controlling for changes in other community indices

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. Effects of ΔTemperature on ΔCTI and of ΔSPEI on ΔCDTI were tested after accounting for changes in disturbance-related indices (i.e., ΔCSTI and ΔCDI). Conversely, effects of changes in population density on ΔCSTI and ΔCDI were tested after accounting for changes in climate change-related indices (i.e., ΔCTI and ΔCDTI). Finally, we tested correlations between changes in climate- and disturbance-related community indices, with ΔCTI or ΔCDTI as dependent variables (separately) and ΔCSTI and ΔCDI as predictors.
