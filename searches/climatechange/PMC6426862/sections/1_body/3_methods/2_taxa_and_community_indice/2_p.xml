 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> spp.,

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). For each time period separately, community indices were calculated for each 25 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> grid cell as the weighted mean index value across taxa found in that grid cell, with weights determined by taxon frequency. In order to obtain values comparable across the four community-level indices, despite the different scales of taxon-level indices, all taxon-level indices were first standardized to vary from 0 to 1 among taxa prior to calculations of community-level indices (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, each community index potentially ranges from 0 to 1 (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), and changes in community indices (the difference between the 1980–2010 and 1790–1900 periods) potentially range between −1 and 1.
