 </sup>. The year 1901 corresponds to the earliest date for which accurate climate records are available in our study area, while 1980 correspond to the earliest modern inventories used in the analysis. Changes in mean annual temperature were calculated as the linear slope of mean annual temperature per calendar year for each cell separately. To assess changes in moisture regime, we used the SPEI, which is based on the difference between monthly precipitation and temperature-induced potential evapotranspiration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup>. Negative values of SPEI indicate dry events, with values &lt; −1.5 commonly considered as severe drought, while positive values indicate wet events. The 24-month SPEI between January 1901 and December 1980 were calculated in R using the SPEI package
