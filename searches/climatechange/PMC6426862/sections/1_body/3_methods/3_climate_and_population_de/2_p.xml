<p id="Par17" class="p">In the absence of precise and extensive data on land-use history over the relevant spatial and temporal scales in our study area, we used changes in human population density since the early nineteenth century as a proxy for the intensity of anthropogenic disturbances over this time period. Sub-regions of our study area experienced their most intense periods of land use at different times. For example, some areas reached their peak in agricultural development and rural population as early as the end of the nineteenth century

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Other regions reached such peaks between the middle and the end the twentieth century

 </sup>. In order to account for this heterogeneity, we computed changes in mean population density between 1831 and, for each cell separately, the maximum mean population density recorded in one of the three subsequent censuses in 1871, 1951 or 2001 (see details in Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), which represent three key periods of land-use history in our study area
