<p id="Par12" class="p">Preindustrial forest composition was characterized using early land survey data aggregated to a 25 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> grid across southern Québec. Early land survey data were extracted from logbooks reporting the original surveys of 302 townships between 1790 and 1900 (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Surveys were conducted along the boundaries of the townships and subdividing range lines within townships (every 1.6 km, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), where surveyors described the forest composition in the form of lists of taxa (e.g., hemlock, beech and maples) (note that these data were collected in a different way than the General Land Office data widely used to reconstruct past forests characteristics in the northeastern United States

 </sup>). In total, 103,011 lists of taxa from 1790 to 1900 were precisely georeferenced using historical and modern digital cadastral maps and used in this study (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). These observations were divided into two geometric types: point observations (69% of total observations, usually spaced 100–200 m apart) and line descriptions (31% of total observations and usually pertaining to one lot boundary of ~260 m). In order to incorporate these two data types in the same database, a weight was assigned to each observation that represented the length of line observations and the mean spacing of point observations (the mean distance to the previous and next observations

 </sup>). Data were then aggregated to a 25 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> grid; in each grid cell we estimated a taxon’s frequency (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) as the cumulative weight of observations in which the taxon was mentioned divided by the total weight of observations. A previous study validated the high accuracy of this method to estimate the nineteenth-century forest composition by comparison with the results obtained using early forest inventories available for a restricted portion of the study area
