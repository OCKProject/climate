  <p class="p">Changes in temperature, moisture and population. Location of the study area (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), and changes from 1901 to 1980 in mean annual temperature (ΔTemperature; 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (ΔSPEI; 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) and changes in population density since 1831 (ΔPopulation; 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>); see Methods for a description of data sources. SPEI is based on the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and negative values of ΔSPEI indicate an increase in drought, while positive values indicate an increase in moisture. Change in population density was calculated as the difference between population density in 1831 and the highest population density recorded since the end of the nineteenth century. Smoothed distributions are shown next to each map (vertical gray and red lines show 0 and mean values, respectively, and ΔPopulation was log-transformed)
