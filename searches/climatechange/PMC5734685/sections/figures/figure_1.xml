  <p class="p">Five hypothetical range shifts are shown with the relative expected effects on local populations. Letâ€™s suppose only one of the five hypothesized range shifts is actually occurring. In the case an appropriate set of local data on population responses being available, it is possible to identify which specific range shift is actually occurring on the basis of the spatial pattern of positive, neutral, and negative responses.</p>
