  <p class="p">The green ellipse highlights the dendrochronological process that from tree ring data (a) generates site-specific chronologies (b) and, through the comparison of recent and past growth (c), defines the pattern of observed responses (d). The pink ellipse highlights the niche modelling process that from the species distribution (e) provides: first the current climatic suitability (f) and one forecast of future suitability for each GCM (g); than, from the differences between future and current suitability (h), defines the GCM-specific patterns of expected responses (i). The comparisons between the observed and the expected patterns of responses (j) provide an evaluation of how well each GCM explains the current species response (k).</p>
