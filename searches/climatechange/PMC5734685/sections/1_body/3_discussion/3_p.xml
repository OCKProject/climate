<p class="p">All the other predictions are not in agreement with the evidences from measured tree growth. It means that these unsupported models did not catch the real processes occurring in the considered European ecosystems. Several potential factors might prevent the identification of tree responses to climate change. These factors can be linked to the nature itself of the response, to the quality of the available data, to the uncertainty associated with the process of dendrochronological analysis and ecological modelling, and to many other aspects. All these factors can be simultaneous and interacting, amplifying the error and further reducing the sensitivity of our approach. In addition, these factors can act in one or more phases of our approach to tree response detection blurring the observed pattern, undermining the predicted response, or attenuating the agreement. In all these cases, the probability of identifying significant explanations of the observed patterns of variation decreases.</p>
