<p class="p">In this study we adopted a multidisciplinary approach, using methods and expertise from climatology, dendrochronology, and ecological niche modeling. We evaluated the performance of 59 GCMs with regard to the observed response of 123 forest sites across central Europe encompassing three species. Predictions from GCMs were translated into maps of expected response (predicted change in suitability) using a niche modelling approach, while the observed ecosystem responses were estimated using dendrochronological methods. Finally, we identified the GCMs that significantly explained the observed spatial pattern of ecosystem responses using a null model approach.</p>
