<p class="p">In this light, estimating potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems on the basis of the full spectrum of available GCMs, as usually done, can be misleading and unproductive. Indeed, as we showed, future suitability can be over- or under-estimated over a large surface by using the entire set of available GCMs. In addition, natural systems are responding to a climatic variation that is close to the upper limit of the predicted variations. Therefore, considering all the possible scenarios as equally probable, albeit scientifically sound, can drive to underestimate the real level of threat and can push to plan ineffective conservation programs. Instead, as in a case of emergency management, the highest priority should be given to solve the real, specific threat existing. All the other, potential options should be taken for developing secondary plans to put in practice if conditions on the ground change. It means that ecosystem responses should be monitored and the specific process occurring should be identified, allowing to reduce the uncertainty on what is really happening and to improve the applicability of the conservation measures. On our opinion, the time is come for a new generation of ecological studies on climate change impacts, which focuses on a restricted range of future scenarios, representing the real threat the ecosystems are facing in order to support practical and finally effective measures.</p>
