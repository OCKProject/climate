<p class="p">Species distributions do not depend on climate only. Geographical range margins might not correspond to the fundamental niche margins [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and trees might react to non-climate factors such as management history [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], invasive exotic species, or pests [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Under these circumstances, the observed growth variations may not represent tree response to climate change and no agreement with predicted responses is expected. In other cases, trees might respond to climate change varying other parameters than those considered. For example, tree height [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] or recruitment rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] might be more affected than stem diameter; when this is true, using dendrochronological data might be an ineffective choice. Furthermore, tree ring data might come from unrepresentative specimens, site locations might be unsuitable to catch the global range variation, or species distribution information might be incomplete or at low resolution. Models of habitat suitability might be poor performers, too specific or too sensitive, or thresholds for assigning positive, neutral, and negative responses might be misplaced. In all these cases, the probability of type II errors increases and our approach fails.
