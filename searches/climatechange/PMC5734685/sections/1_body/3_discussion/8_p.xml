<p class="p">Our results show that European ecosystems are facing a very harsh variation of climatic conditions, which is compatible with the top end of all the available GCMs. Instrumental measurements of global CO

Indeed, notwithstanding the international community, in the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris, set the target of holding the increase in the global average temperature above pre-industrial levels well below 2°C, with such a level of emissions the rise of global surface temperature for the end of the 21
