<p class="p">Our model-based expected responses suggest that the three species will have different shifts in the years to come, as indicated by the variable number of sites with positive, neutral, and negative expectations. However, the observed responses, derived from dendrochronological data, support the predictions of four models for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> only. These four models could have several applications. For instance, they could be useful in adaptive forestry [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Indeed, the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> in central Europe, where climate suitability is expected to decrease, could become less efficient than in the past and questionable in the long run. Interestingly, the four significant matches between observed and expected pattern only occurs for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and, even more interestingly, all involves GCMs among those with the worst prediction in terms of global warming. In other words, we found the fingerprint of a particularly dangerous scenario of climate change in European forests.
