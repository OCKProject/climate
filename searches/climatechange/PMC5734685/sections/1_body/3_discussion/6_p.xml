<p class="p">On the other hand, the probability of false positive is very low for our approach, because the level of agreement is due to the joint occurrence of multiple events (site-by-site match of observed and expected trends). As a result, when everything works properly and no factor interferes with the analyses, our spatial approach allows to identify very small differences in geographic patterns of variations. In other words, our results show accurately what is happening in terms of geographic response to climate change by Scots pine and, therefore, which specific climate trajectory is driving such response. Overall, our approach can be interpreted as a photographic film with very low-speed and high-resolution, which works properly only with perfect lighting and setting but, under such conditions, provides extremely detailed images of its subjects.</p>
