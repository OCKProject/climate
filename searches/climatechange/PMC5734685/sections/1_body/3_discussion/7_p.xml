<p class="p">The capacity of evidencing with high precision the response of natural ecosystems and the relative climatic pressures makes our spatial approach particularly suitable for the implementation of a monitoring/alarm system. This system should consist of a network of sites where dynamic features of populations (e.g. individual growth, demographic trends, reproductive success) are measured for multiple species. The network of sites could be coordinated at a local, regional, or global scale and it would provide detailed background information for adaptation strategies. Indeed, effective strategies for reducing the impacts of climate change (e.g. adaptive management of forests [

 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]) require as precise as possible pictures of the stress to be faced. Interestingly, some efforts to set up networks of sites where monitoring and ecological research is carried out on the long run have been made (e.g. the global ILTER network [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] with its regional and national affiliates, the ICPForests monitoring network [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]): these networks could represent a perfect basis for producing the necessary information through the explicit application of our spatial approach. This would only require the collection of some additional dynamic variables and a coordination that explicitly take this approach into account but valuable information for adaptation strategies would be available in return.
