<p class="p">As showed, our approach is prone to false negative, failing to reject the null hypothesis even if it is false. In this light, the lack of significant results for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> could mean that one or more of the abovementioned issues prevented us to detect any pattern. It means that the observed responses for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>, which showed a general positive pattern of growth and a stable pattern respectively, could be generated by non-climate linked factors (e.g. different forest management or pest outbreaks) or by their interactions with climate change. It does not necessary imply that these two species are insensitive to climate change, rather it simply shows that our approach failed to disentangle effects from multiple, possibly interacting drivers.
