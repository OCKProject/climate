 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In order to plan effective adaptation strategies, global scenarios of climate conditions at medium and long term are needed. As a response, a large number of climate modelling centres around the world participated in the Coordinated Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which represented the basis for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-5

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for RCP6.0, and 8.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for RCP8.5. These four RCPs include one mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two stabilization scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), and one scenario with very high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5). The goal of working with scenarios is to better understand uncertainties for taking decisions that are robust under a wide range of possible future conditions [
