<p class="p">Our hypothesis is that, if an appropriate set of local data on population responses is available, it is possible to identify which specific range shift is actually occurring, indicating which actual path of climate change the species is responding to. In other terms, we can validate the different GCMs on the basis of the spatial arrangement of positive, neutral, and negative responses in population dynamics (

In order to verify our hypothesis and to provide foresights about future climatic trends, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach based on the comparison of observed and expected spatial patterns of response to climate change. More specifically, we utilized dendrochronological data to define growth variations for European trees in a set of sites and we compared this variations with those expected from an Ecological Niche Modelling approach for the same species. Doing this, we identified which specific models, among those included in the CMIP5, catch the real climate variation driving the response of natural ecosystems. In addition, we quantified the extent of the potential improvement in habitat suitability modelling when our criterion is adopted.
