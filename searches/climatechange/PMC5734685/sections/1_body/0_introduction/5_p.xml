<p class="p">This approach to range shift observation involves monitoring dynamic characteristics of the populations, such as population density, reproductive success, condition of the individuals, or other fitness-related traits whose variation can be interpreted as a response to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], neutral responses is a sign of no major variations in local suitability of core sites, and negative responses highlight the reduction of suitability in trailing edge sites [

 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. On the basis of the spatial arrangement of these responses, it is possible to detect any variation of species range compatible with climate change. On the other hand, it is also possible to validate any prediction of climate change effects on species distribution by verifying whether the spatial pattern of observed responses is coherent with the expected variation in habitat suitability.
