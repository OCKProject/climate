 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], reviewed the efforts to evaluate the performance of the CMIP5 models, both individually and collectively. Basically, the most direct and simple strategy to evaluate a model is to compare its predictions with measured values of the same quantities (e.g., global temperature, cumulative precipitation, solar radiation), as generally done by climatologic literature [

 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Furthermore, other property of CMIP5 climate models have been tested, such as the cross-scale properties of models [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], or uncertainty in responses to climate projections, such as carbon balance alterations [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no research was focused on quantifying how well the available models explain the occurring variations in natural ecosystems and on identifying which specific scenario does it better.
