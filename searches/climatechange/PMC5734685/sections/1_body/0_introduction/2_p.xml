Nevertheless, the range of available scenarios is so large that the uncertainty associated to comprehensive predictions may hamper the understanding of what is actually happening and the deriving decisions are robust but often ineffective. This is particularly true when decisions regard adaptation strategies for reducing the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems. Therefore, it would be important to reduce such uncertainty, identifying which specific scenarios describe and predict the real climatic trend. This would allow to clarify with higher confidence the effect on nature and humankind and to plan more effective strategies.
