<p class="p">In order to identify which specific GCM explains the observed pattern of response by ecosystems, we utilized the recent growth variation for three species of European trees. For each species, we used dendrochronological data from several sites to define the observed spatial pattern of growth variation and an approach based on ecological niche modelling to define the spatial patterns of habitat suitability variation expected under each GCM. Then, we compared the observed pattern of growth variation with the expected patterns of suitability variation in the same sites, using a process based on null-models. The level of agreement between expected and observed patterns was assessed and the GCMs with the highest agreement were identified. These GCMs are those that better describe the specific changes which the trees are actually responding to. Therefore, these GCMs are those indicating the most probable pathways the ecosystems, and the humankind, are on.</p>
