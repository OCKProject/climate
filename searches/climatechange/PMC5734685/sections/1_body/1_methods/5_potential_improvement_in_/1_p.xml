<p class="p">Identifying which specific GCMs explain the real responses of ecosystems allows to estimate the potential error committed using all the available GCMs in habitat suitability modelling by including those that do not represent the real pressure on ecosystems. To do this, we compared the consensus models of future suitability deriving from the entire set of predictions, based on all the 59 GCMs, and from the restricted set of models that explain the observed ecosystem responses. Consensus models were calculated as the average of the individual predictions. We calculated the 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test between suitability values predicted by all the 59 models and by the selected models in each and every raster cell. This means that we performed 434885 individual 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests, comparing all the pixels with mean suitability value &gt; 30. In order to maintain this calculation within reasonable time limit, we adopted a parallel computation approach using a cluster of seven processors in the R-based package ‘parallel’ [
