<p class="p">To define the observed pattern of response for each tree species, we adopted a dendrochronological approach. Site-specific series of average growth were created from measures of tree-ring widths and the recent growth was compared with that of the previous century. This allowed to define whether local populations are growing faster, slower, or as fast as in the past and to obtain a pattern of observed growth variations for each tree species. The sequence of favourable and unfavourable climate is faithfully recorded by the sequence of wide and narrow annual rings in large numbers of tree species [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This pattern of wide and narrow rings can be used as an indicator for monitoring environmental processes in most regions around the world [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2a</xref>) were analyzed for creating site-specific series of average growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2b</xref>). Second, for each site we compared the average growth of the most recent decade with that of the previous century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2c</xref>) through a null-model approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Third, we assigned positive observed trends to sites where the recent growth is significantly faster than before, negative trends to sites where the recent growth is slower than before, and neutral trends to sites where the recent growth is neither faster nor slower than before. Doing this, we obtained a spatial pattern of observed growth trends for each tree species (
