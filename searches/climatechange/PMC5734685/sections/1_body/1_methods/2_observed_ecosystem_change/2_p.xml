<p class="p">Tree ring data were obtained by The International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], which is the world largest public archive of tree ring data, managed by the Paleoclimatology Team at the National Centres for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the World Data Centre for Paleoclimatology at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The ITRDB contains tree ring data from samples collected in the field by using an increment borer to extract a wood core of 5mm in diameter along the radius of the tree. Generally, two cores from 20 trees of the same species were collected in each site [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. From each core, series of tree-ring widths was measured with a variable resolution between 0.01 and 0.001 mm. All the series passed the standard dendrochronological methods of data cleaning and cross-dating [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Species-specific data for each sampling site are provided as a raw data file, containing all the measurements of the tree ring widths for each single series.
