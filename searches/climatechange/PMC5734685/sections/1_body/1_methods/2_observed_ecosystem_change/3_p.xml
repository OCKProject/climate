<p class="p">From the entire database, we selected data from European sites (west of 40.2° E) with series ending after 2000. Then, we selected the species with data from at least 20 sites. We visually inspected the geographic distribution of species sites and ranges and excluded two species because they did not respond to the exigencies of the experimental design. First, we eliminated 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> L. because the sites in the ITRDB were clustered in few areas of the species range. Second, we discarded 
 <italic class="italic">Larix decidua</italic> Mill. because of the too small size of the distribution. As a consequence, we considered series of ring width from all the available sites for three species (i.e. Norway spruce, 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> (L.) H.Karst.: 40 sites; Scots pine, 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.: 57 sites; Sessile oak, 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> (Mattuschka) Liebl.: 26 sites; see
