<p class="p">Finally, for each species we defined the response to climate change (positive, negative, or neutral) in the considered sites as follows. We compared the growth indices during the last decade in the site chronology with those of the previous century. We adopted a null-model based approach for this comparison, contrasting the average growth index of the last 10 years with the averages of 30,000 random selections of 10 years from the previous 100 years. When the recent growth was lower/higher than 5-th/95-th percentile of the randomized previous growths, we rejected the null hypothesis (corresponding to a neutral response) that the recent growth was drawn at random from the distribution of the randomized previous growths [
