<p class="p">The downloaded raw series of ring width data for each site were detrended and the results were averaged into one site-specific chronology. Detrending allows samples with large differences in growth rates to be combined, and can be used to remove age-related effects and potential disturbance signals [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] on growth trends. The detrending process involves fitting a curve to the ring-width series and dividing each ring-width value by the corresponding curve value to generate a series of growth indices. To do this, we used a modified negative exponential curve [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] (or a linear model when the suitable nonlinear model could not be used) in the R-based [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] package ‘dplR’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The obtained index values are unitless, with a nearly stable mean and variance, allowing indices from numerous trees to be averaged into a site chronology. We combined the indices to produce a standardized site chronology using Tukey’s Biweight Robust Mean [
