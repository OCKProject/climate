<p class="p">In order to predict the variation of climate suitability under future respect to current conditions, we projected the fitted models into the available Global Climate Models (GCMs). We used GCMs elaborated by 19 research centres for the four RCPs for 2050 (average for 2041â€“2060) and downscaled at the same spatial resolution as the current models (i.e. 2.5 arc-min) using WorldClim as baseline climate [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189468.s005" class="xref">S5 Table</xref> for a complete list) and we used the same model parameterizations as in the current conditions for projecting climate suitability into the future and for creating the final consensuses model. As a result, we obtained one single spatial prediction of future climate suitability for each GCM.
