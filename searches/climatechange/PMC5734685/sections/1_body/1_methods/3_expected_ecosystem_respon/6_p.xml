<p class="p">The expected pattern of response (positive, negative, or neutral) under each GCM was defined by generating a map of suitability variation as the difference between future and current model predictions. From the map of variation, we identified the areas where climatic suitability is expected to increase, reduce, or remain almost the same by selecting one positive and one negative threshold of variation. Since the frequency distribution of suitability variation had very high kurtosis and skewness, we selected two thresholds corresponding to the medians of positive and negative values. Finally, the expected responses were assigned to the same sites of the observed responses on the basis of their location. Doing this, we assigned negative expected responses to sites falling in areas with decreasing suitability, neutral expected responses to sites in areas with almost constant suitability, and positive expected responses to sites in areas with increasing suitability. As a result, we obtained one spatial pattern of expected responses for each of the considered GCMs.</p>
