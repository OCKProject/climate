 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. EUFORGEN provide distribution maps for 34 species of European trees compiled by experts, based on existing bibliography and other information sources. Distribution maps are supplied as polygons for the main range, plus points for dispersed localities. We generated 5,000 random points across the study area (i.e. Europe, west of 40.2Â° E) and assumed as presence sites those falling into the species range, or close to the dispersed localities (&lt; 2.5 arc-minutes), and as absence sites those falling outside. These presence/absence data were used for fitting the habitat suitability models on current climatic conditions.
