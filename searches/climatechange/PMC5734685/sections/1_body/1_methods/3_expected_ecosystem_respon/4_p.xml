<p class="p">Ecological modelling is associated to a certain degree of uncertainty coming also from the model building procedure itself [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. For incorporating the model-linked uncertainty into the outputs, we adopted an ensemble modelling approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Therefore, we used different methods for calibrating models of climate suitability on species distribution data. In particular, we fitted Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], Generalized Boosting Models (GBMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], and Classification Tree Analyses (CTAs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] in the R-based [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] package ‘biomod2’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Each independent model was projected into the current climate across the study area and three-fold cross-validated by calculating the true skill statistic (TSS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Finally, we calculated the TSS-weighted sum of the independent models for generating the specific consensus model of current habitat suitability.
