<p class="p">We used climate surfaces from the WorldClim databank [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] for defining the species-specific climatic niche. The databank consists of climate data with global coverage for 19 climatic variables interpolated using measures for the period 1950â€“2000. In particular, we used climate surfaces with pixels of 2.5 arc-minutes of geographic degree, corresponding to a resolution of approximately 5 km [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Climate variables were assigned to the presence/absence points and selected for reducing multicollinearity by discarding those with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) &gt; 8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. After this selection eight variables were retained for modelling (see
