<p class="p">To define the spatial pattern of expected responses, we adopted an approach based on ecological niche modelling. First, we defined the species-environment interactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] from the current species distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2e</xref>), by fitting a set of models within an ensemble approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Second, we projected the defined interactions into climate surfaces for present conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2f</xref>) and for the different scenarios of future climate (i.e. GCMs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2g</xref>). Third, we assigned negative responses to sites where future climate suitability is lower than current, neutral responses to sites where future climate suitability is similar to current, and positive responses to sites where future climate suitability is higher than current (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g002" class="xref">Fig 2h</xref>). Finally, by combining all sites, we obtained the spatial pattern of expected response under every tested scenarios of climate change (
