<p class="p">The dendrochronological analyses identify sites with positive, neutral, and negative responses for all the three species. The Norway spruce, 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>, has positive responses in 18 sites, neutral responses in 18 sites, and negative responses in four of the 40 sites of this species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189468.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). The Scots pine, 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic>, has positive responses in 10 sites, neutral responses in 37 sites, and negative responses in 10 of the 57 sites of this species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189468.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The Sessile oak, 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petrea</italic>, has positive responses in three sites, neutral responses in 18 sites, and negative responses in five of the 26 sites of this species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189468.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). Overall, the percentage of non-stable sites (i.e. with positive or negative responses) is pretty high, being 55%, 35%, and 31% for the three species, respectively. The non-stable sites have more often positive than negative responses for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> (Ï‡
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 8.91, p &lt; 0.01) but positive responses are as frequent as negative for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>.
