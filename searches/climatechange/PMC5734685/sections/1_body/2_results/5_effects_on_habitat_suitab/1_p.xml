<p class="p">The difference between the consensus model of the entire set of 59 models and the consensus of the selected four models for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> has a clear geographic pattern. This is particularly high in a large area of north-eastern Europe (see green areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) and particularly low on the Alps and in Scandinavia (see pink areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). As indicated by the pixel-based 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests, the difference is significant in a large area of central and eastern Europe as well as in several smaller areas in Scandinavia, Alps, and Balkans (see darker areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The future suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> is significantly higher when predicted by the entire set of models in an area of 1425251 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and it is higher when predicted by the four selected models in 202256 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. These areas indicate the extent of the error potentially done by predicting future suitability including GCMs that do not represent the real pressure on ecosystems.
