<p class="p">The GCM predicting the pattern of variation with the highest agreement with the occurring responses is MIROC-ESM-CHEM [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189468.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and the second best is MIROC5 [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189468.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), both parameterized under the RCP8.5 (indicated in figures as "mi85" and "mc85" respectively). Both MIROC-ESM-CHEM and MIROC5 are global climate models developed by the University of Tokyo, the National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan, and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology for the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The third and the fourth GCMs, which obtained almost significant agreements, are CNRM-CM5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] ("cn" in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189468.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) at RCP8.5 ("cn85" in figures) and BCC-CSM1-1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189468.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] ("bc" in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189468.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) at RCP6.0 ("bc60" in figures). These GCMs are models developed for the CMIP5 by the National Centre for Meteorological Research of France and the Beijing Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration, respectively. These four GCMs are those explaining the geographic pattern of growth variation in
