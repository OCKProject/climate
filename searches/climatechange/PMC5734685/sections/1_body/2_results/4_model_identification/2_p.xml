<p class="p">Among the best four GCMs, the level of agreement with the observed pattern grows with the change intensity of climate scenario (

The fourth GCM is based on the RCP6.0 but, at the same time, it is the less significant among the best four (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189468.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, the very best explanation of the occurring pattern derives from the GCM predicting the highest temperature increase in the study area (i.e. mi85). Similarly, the second model to obtain significant agreement with the observed pattern predicts very high increases in air temperature and annual precipitation across Europe by 2050 (i.e. mc85). Our results indicate that these GCMs catch the climate variation which
