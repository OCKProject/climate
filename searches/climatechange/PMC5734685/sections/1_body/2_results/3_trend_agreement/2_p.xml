<p class="p">The four models explaining the spatial pattern of observed responses agree in predicting a substantial split of suitable areas for

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189468.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). In particular, Fennoscandia and Alps are expected to remain climatically suitable even on the long run (i.e. 2050), while a strong reduction of suitability is expected to occur in central Europe with variable extent and intensity among the considered GCMs. This general pattern of geographic variation in climate suitability is common to all the best performing four models. Overall, the level of agreement increases with the strength and amplitude of the suitability reduction. Indeed, the best explanation of the occurring pattern corresponds to the largest contraction predicted for the main suitable areas and a small enlargement at the western range margin.
