<p class="p">Future predictions of species climatic suitability vary largely with the different GCM considered. The number of sites with negative expected responses lays between 10 and 21 (mean 15.63) for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>, between 15 and 37 (mean 23.10) for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic>, and between 0 and 9 (mean 1.41) for 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>. The number of sites with neutral expected responses lays between 17 and 29 (mean 23.97) for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>, between 15 and 29 (mean 22.09) for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic>, and between 14 and 23 (mean 21.59) for 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>. The number of sites with positive expected responses lays between 0 and 8 (mean 0.41) for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>, between 1 and 20 (mean 11.81) for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic>, and is 3 for 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>. The mean percentage of non-stable sites (i.e. with positive or negative expected responses) is 40%, 61%, and 17% for the three species respectively. These values represent the GCM-specific expected responses that are compared with the observed ones.
