<p class="p">Ecological niche models under current climatic conditions obtain very high validation scores for all the three species. Individual models for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> have TSS and AUC values in the range 0.77–0.86 (mean 0.82) and 0.94–0.98 (mean 0.96) respectively and the consensus model for the same species have TSS = 0.88 and AUC = 0.98. Individual models for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> have TSS and AUC values in the range 0.77–0.83 (mean 0.80) and 0.93–0.96 (mean 0.95), respectively and the consensus model for the same species have TSS = 0.85 and AUC = 0.97. Individual models for 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> have TSS and AUC values in the range 0.77–0.83 (mean 0.81) and 0.93–0.96 (mean 0.95), respectively and the consensus model for the same species have TSS = 0.85 and AUC = 0.98. These values guarantee good fittings and are solid bases for robust predictions.
