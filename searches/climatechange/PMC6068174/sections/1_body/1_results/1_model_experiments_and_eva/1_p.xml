 </sup> (BAU scenario (RCP8.5) and moderate mitigation scenario (RCP4.5)) (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>, Supplementary Information for simulations domain, and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). For the historical and future period, we performed six sets of simulations, with and without irrigation. By comparing the historical period simulations, with and without irrigation, we estimate the impact of irrigation on heatwaves in the historical climate period as described by the TW. The results of these simulations reveal a significant role for irrigation in enhancing the magnitude of extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and hence the intensity of heatwaves. (By “extreme” we mean maximum simulated value over this period.) Over the irrigated region and NCP, the extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over a 30-year period increases by about 0.5 and 0.3 °C, respectively, as a result of irrigation during historical period. This impact of irrigation is even larger, if we consider the average TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> instead of extreme values, and more pronounced during the relatively drier months of early summer (May and June) (see Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). These are the months when irrigation has the largest impact on land surface conditions.
