<p id="Par11" class="p">Irrigation enhances the response of maximum TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> to climate change. The response of maximum TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over irrigated areas due to the combination of irrigation and climate change (estimated from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, f</xref>) is about 3.9 °C. This is larger than the sum of: (i) the response of maximum TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over irrigated areas to irrigation alone (estimated from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, d</xref>), of about 0.5 °C, and (ii) the response of maximum TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over the same areas (without irrigation) to climate change alone (estimated from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, c</xref>) of about 2.9 °C. This non-linearity in the response of TW to the combination of irrigation and climate change is likely caused by an enhanced water vapor feedback mechanism over irrigated areas. This topic will be investigated in our future research.
