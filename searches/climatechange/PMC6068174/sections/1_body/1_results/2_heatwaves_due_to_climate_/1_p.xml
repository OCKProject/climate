<p id="Par10" class="p">The impacts of climate change are significantly larger than those of irrigation. The extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> over irrigated area and NCP are projected to increase by an additional 3.4 and 3.3 °C, respectively, assuming a BAU scenario of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with irrigation, while increases of extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> are 2.9 and 3 °C over irrigated area NCP, respectively, without irrigation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The spatial distribution of TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> under current and future climate features three regions with significantly warmer conditions: the NCP close to the Eastern coast, the Yangtze river valley, and the Southern coast. All these regions are characterized by relatively low elevation (lower than 50 m) compared to the surrounding area (e.g., Yan Mountain and Yaihang Mountain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>)), which is a major factor explaining occurrence of relatively warm conditions. Over several locations in the NCP and along the Eastern coast of China, such as the areas around Weifang, Jining, Qingdao, Rizhao, Yantai, Shanghai, and Hangzhou under the BAU scenario, TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> exceeds the critical threshold for human survival of 35 °C, during several episodes over a 30-year period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Moderate climate change mitigation efforts, represented by the RCP4.5 scenario of GHG emissions, reduce the risk of such heatwaves significantly; however, deadly heatwaves are still projected even under those conditions, though significantly less frequent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In interpretation of the results of this study, we emphasize that TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values as low as 30 °C would qualify as “Extremely Dangerous” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Service Heat Index (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>).
