 </sup> as a hotspot for extreme heatwaves based on observations from the last few decades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The response of extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> to the GHG forcing over NCP is significantly larger than the corresponding response over the Persian Gulf region or that over the Ganges and Indus valleys (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). In comparison to the Persian Gulf and South Asia, NCP is the only region within that Asian belt that is not influenced by a warm ocean or sea next to it. This observation may explain some of the enhanced response in this region. If we use the 95% percentile value of TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as a measure of the intensity of extreme heatwaves, this variable increases by about 3 to 4 °C over the NCP, under RCP8.5, compared to an increase of 2 to 3 °C under the same scenario over the Persian Gulf region or the South Asia region (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Taking this enhanced response to GHG forcing together with the simulated impact of irrigation in this region brings the extreme TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> simulated by our model to approach and exceed the 35 °C threshold. NCP is likely to experience significantly warmer conditions and more severe heatwaves towards the end of the twenty-first century compared to the early decades of the twentieth century.
