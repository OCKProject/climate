<p id="Par8" class="p">In this study, we project based on an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model simulations that climate change would add significantly to the anthropogenic effects of irrigation, increasing the risk from heatwaves over the NCP region, an area with extensive irrigation development covering a relatively large fraction of the land surface. Under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, NCP is likely to experience deadly heatwaves with TW exceeding the threshold defining what Chinese farmers may tolerate, while working outdoors without air conditioning.</p>
