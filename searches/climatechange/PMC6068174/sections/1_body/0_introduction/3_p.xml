 </sup>. The choice of TW is motivated by the fact that the skin of a sweating human body can be approximated by this temperature, and the choice of 6 h is rooted in the assumption that a healthy human may not survive outdoors at a TW of 35 °C for more than 6 h. Hence, TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of 35 °C is assumed as physiologic threshold for survival of humans
