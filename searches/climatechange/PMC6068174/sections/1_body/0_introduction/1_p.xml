 </sup>. This region, inhabited by about 400 million, is one of the most densely populated in the world (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The rich soils in this region were formed by sedimentary deposits from the Yellow, Huai, and Hai rivers, providing excellent conditions for agriculture. The rainfall levels are relatively low compared to similar locations in South China, making irrigation necessary for supplementing soil water during the spring to early summer growing season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This fertile plain has experienced vast expansion of irrigated agriculture which impacts significantly the surface radiation, surface energy balance, and boundary layer development in ways that impact surface humidity, and temperature. In observations that describe regional climate patterns, NCP stands out as a hot spot in the China-wide map of the maximum wet-bulb temperature (TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) observed in the last few decades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). Given these past observations, the region is expected to remain vulnerable to heatwaves in the future.
