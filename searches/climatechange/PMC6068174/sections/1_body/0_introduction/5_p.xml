 </sup> as one of the impacted regions, the relatively coarse resolution and global focus of their analysis precluded identification of hotspots for heatwaves at regional and local scales within China. The same studies did not include analysis of the impact of irrigation on heatwaves. The high resolution of our simulations, including representation of irrigation processes, makes it feasible to address these two important topics.
