<p id="Par6" class="p">Previous studies concluded that irrigation impacts the land-surface energy balance and atmospheric boundary layer development significantly

 </sup>. The direct effects of irrigation are to enhance evapotranspiration, to cool the surface temperature, and to moisten the air

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. The cooler surface emits significantly less long-wave radiation upward (Stephanâ€“Boltzmann law), and the moistened air emits significantly more long-wave radiation towards the surface (water vapor greenhouse effect). As a result, irrigation tends to enhance the net long-wave radiation available to fuel total flux of latent and sensible heat into the atmosphere. Similarly, irrigation may impact how the surface absorbs incoming solar radiation

 </sup>, but the sign of that effect would depend on the nature of land cover before irrigation. In addition, irrigation impacts the development of the atmospheric boundary layer

 </sup>. Irrigation reduces the sensible heat flux resulting in lowering of the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer. Hence, irrigation enhances the total flux of heat only slightly, but results in a significantly shallower boundary layer. Considering the total energy of the surface air in the atmospheric boundary layer, including latent and sensible forms, as measured by the TW over extensively irrigated plains such as those in the NCP, we would expect an enhanced magnitude of the boundary layer energy per unit mass as measured by variables such as moist static energy or the TW.
