 </sup>, we emphasize the important role of humidity, and demonstrate a new approach to characterize heatwaves through the use of TW consistent with the physiologic threshold discussed above, and the use of 6-h period as the duration of a heatwave reflecting how long humans may survive at that threshold temperature. However, the magnitude of the projected enhancement of the risk of deadly heatwaves in China seems larger than the projected enhancements along the coasts of the Persian Gulf or over the Ganges and Indus valleys (Fig.Â
