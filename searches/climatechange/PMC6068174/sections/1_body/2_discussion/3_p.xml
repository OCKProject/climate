 </sup>. Although the emissions per capita from China may not stand out compared to other nations, national climate change policy in China will need to carefully evaluate and weigh the projected negative impacts of severe heatwaves on local population against the positive impacts of economic development. Enhanced investments in renewables, already adopted widely in China, may offer an alternative pathway that achieves economic development and mitigates local impacts of future global climate change. However, even under moderate mitigation scenarios severe heatwaves are projected for NCP which may necessitate simultaneous development of effective public health adaptation measures to avoid the deadly impacts of future heatwaves.
