<p id="Par13" class="p">Although the model used in this study has been tested extensively over China and other regions of Asia, significant limitations may persist. The representation of surface processes and other physical parametrizations in our model represent a significant source of uncertainty. In order to minimize that source, we have tested the model against observations of surface temperature, humidity, and TW. As shown in the Supplementary Information (see Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>), incorporation of irrigation improves significantly the skill of the model in reproducing the observed surface climate. Another source of uncertainty is the choice of the CMIP5 Global Climate Model simulations used in specifying the lateral boundary conditions for MRCM, historically and in the future. In order to reduce this uncertainty, we carefully selected only three climate models that show satisfactory performance in simulating the climate of this region (selection criteria described in the Methods section). Our results are based on the ensemble of simulations from three sets of experiments using the three different GCM simulations as boundary conditions.
