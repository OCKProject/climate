 </sup> participant models. Since the regional climate model is constrained by atmospheric lateral boundary conditions, selection of the GCMs is important. In this study, three GCMs are carefully selected based on a screening process, including rigorous evaluation of the GCM performance in simulating key climate variables for the historical period over the target domain (see selection of GCMs section below). The selected models are the Community Climate System Model Version 4 (hereafter referred to as CCSM)

To quantify the impact of a range of GHG concentrations, four future projection simulations, with and without irrigation module, are performed with two different RCP scenarios

Each set of experiments consists of three ensemble members forced by three GCMs. The historical baseline period consists of 31 years from 1975 to 2005 and the projected future period covers 31 years from 2070 to 2100.
