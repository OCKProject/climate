 <sub class="sub">max</sub> data are transferred from the 0.75° × 0.75° horizontal grid to the 25-km MRCM grid. In the second step, consistent MRCM and ERA-Interim climatologies of TW
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is computed for each day of the year on the MRCM 25-km grid. In the final step, the magnitude of the bias for each day of the year is estimated by the difference between 30-day running means of the two climatologies. The daily bias is then applied to the MRCM daily values of TW
