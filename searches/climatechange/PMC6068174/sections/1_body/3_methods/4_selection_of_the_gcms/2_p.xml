 </sup> based on their performance over Southeast Asia. And then we select 6 GCMs out of the 19 by requiring an oceanic horizontal resolution of 1.11Â° or higher, capable of simulating complex ocean processes over this region. Over land, the surface temperature, TW, relative humidity, and precipitation from GCMs are objectively analyzed and compared to CRU
