 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) (dove tree or handkerchief tree in English, gongtong or gezishu in Chinese), included in Davidiaceae (by some in Nyssaceae or Cornaceae), is a rare and endangered tree species with small populations restricted to the humid mountains of south-central and southwestern China, mostly confined to the mountains surrounding the Sichuan Basin. The forests containing 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> as one of the dominants are mainly scattered at 1300–1900 m altitude (but at 2300–2800 m in Yunnan) in areas with cool, foggy and cloudy climatic conditions. At these altitudes, 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> co-dominates with other Tertiary relict plants including 
 <italic class="italic">Tetracentron, Cercidiphyllum, Tapiscia, Dipteronia, Pterostyrax, Carya, Liquidambar,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Decaisnea</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Davidia involucrata</italic> also occurs, but very rarely, between 900–1300 m, growing with some evergreen broad-leaved trees of 
 <italic class="italic">Cyclobalanopsis, Castanopsis, Lithocarpus, Phoebe, Machilus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Neolitsea</italic>. No adequate studies have been carried out to estimate the potential impact of climate change on this Tertiary relict species, and so far no conservation strategies that consider climate change have been proposed.
