<p class="p">The “best” model was evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation with MaxEnt, with performance assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. AUC scores may range between 0.5 (randomness) and 1 (exact match), with those above 0.9 indicating a good performance of the model

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. We applied the maximum sensitivity plus specificity (MSS) logistic threshold, which is very robust with all types of data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref>, to obtain a map of absence/presence (with the probability of presence shown as continuous values from the threshold to 1). The resulting map, which is the average of the multiple runs from the cross-validation, can be regarded as the “standard” model (
