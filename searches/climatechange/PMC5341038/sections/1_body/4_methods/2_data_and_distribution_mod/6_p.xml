<p class="p">As suggested by many authors, uncertainty should be addressed in Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) because it can produce large biases on the niche predictions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref> and references therein. Thus, although our model performed well (AUC = 0.982 ± 0.006), a “consensus ensemble approach” or “consensus approach”
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref> was applied in order to visualize the variability in the predicted suitable areas among all generated models. A map showing such variability (or uncertainty) was obtained as follows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>): first all 20 continuous projection maps were converted into binary maps (applying the MSS threshold), and then were calculated how many models predict each pixel as a suitable area. Thus, a continuous map with pixels ranging from 0 to 20 was obtained. Converting these values to probabilities (i.e., 0 as 0%, 10 as 50%, or 20 as 100%), we finally obtained an estimate of each pixel’s probability of being predicted as suitable area. Every pixel for which at least 95% of the models (i.e., 19 of 20 and 20 of 20) forecast species presence was regarded as a pixel of high probability of being predicted by modeling (“presence pixel”). In an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in our models, those pixels not ranking as “presence pixels” were removed from the “standard” output maps to obtain a “refined” model where only those predicted areas with 95% of confidence are shown (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) with this method, the robustness of the forecast is improved
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. A proof of this is that the reduction of suitable area when the uncertainty is taken into account is mainly focused on those pixels with low logistic probability (threshold to 0.5, area loss = 46.54% for the present time; 0.5 to 1, area loss = 3.99 for the present time;
