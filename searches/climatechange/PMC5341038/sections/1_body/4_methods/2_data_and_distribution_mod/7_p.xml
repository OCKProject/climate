<p class="p">All ENM predictions were visualized in ArcGIS v. 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The suitable area (in km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for all models at each time slice for 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> was also calculated in ArcGIS. To estimate suitable area gains or losses (or unchanged areas) for both past and future scenarios with respect to the present, binary output maps were overlapped with the Intersect Tool of ArcGIS. To provide conservation advice on 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic>, the digitized map of Chinese protected areas was overlapped with the species occurrences and both binary maps of the present and future scenarios.
