 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. Although finer resolutions are available (30 arc-sec) for the bioclimatic variables, these may not be appropriate given uncertainties associated with geo-referencing approximate localities (or with geo-reference errors). We designed as the study area a region considerably larger than the current species range (15–56°N and 72–143°E). Although such an approach may tend to generalize conditions found near the occupied localities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, we have considered most of East Asia as the study area, given the complexity of this region in terms of topography and Neogene biogeographic history (including substantial marine transgressions/regressions) and the need to include also the areas where recent (Pliocene and Pleistocene) 
 <italic class="italic">Davidia</italic> fossils have been found.
