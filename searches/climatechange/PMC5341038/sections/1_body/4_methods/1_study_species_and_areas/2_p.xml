<p class="p">Today scattered stands of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> range approximately from 98–110°E, 26–32°N in south-central and southwestern China, including Hunan, Hubei, Chongqing, Sichuan, southern Shaanxi, southern Gansu, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces. The latitudes are subtropical. Vegetation types in this area are diverse, according to altitudes, mainly including subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests, deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved mixed forests, warm temperate coniferous forests, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests, cold-temperate coniferous forests, alpine scrub and meadow; however, by far most of the vegetation consists of what is commonly referred to as the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. A striking feature is that within the transitional altitudinal zone from subtropical warm and humid evergreen to the temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests, where in some cases there is also an admixture of species of gymnosperms, a number of extant Tertiary relict plant species thrive today
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. The climate is dominated by the Asian monsoon system, including the East Asian summer monsoon, the Indian summer monsoon, and the East Asian winter monsoon, with dry continental winds in winter and moist oceanic winds in summer. In general, in the subtropical areas, lands east of longitude 103° are more influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon, while to the west the Indian summer monsoon dominates.
