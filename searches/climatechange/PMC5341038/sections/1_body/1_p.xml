<p class="p">China enjoys great species diversity, with ca. 30,250 seed plant species. The key areas of south-central China and Indo-Burma (including most parts of Yunnan) are two of the 25 designated global biodiversity hotspots
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Two plant diversity centers with high levels of endemism are located in this region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. The area was never covered by extensive, unified ice-sheets, owing in part to its complex topography
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> and to moderate cooling as compared to other regions of China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Moreover, these areas did not suffer the extreme aridity that is usually associated with the glacial periods: within China, south-central and southwestern areas were those with the smallest LGM precipitation deficits, rainfall being even higher than at present during the autumn and winter seasons
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. So the mountains of south-central and southwestern China have had a relatively stable long-term environment, and are now referred to as the Pleistocene glacial refugia

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Refugia represent climatically stable areas and remain a high conservation priority as important sites for the long-term persistence of species. Today, they are in danger of overexploitation. Climate change has also become a great threat to these species and their forests.
