 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> as expressed by occurrence probability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>). Our model showed excellent performance (AUC = 0.982 ± 0.006). Temperature seasonality (bio4), followed by the precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18) and the annual mean temperature (bio1) (data not shown) were the most important variables determining the potential distribution of the species.
