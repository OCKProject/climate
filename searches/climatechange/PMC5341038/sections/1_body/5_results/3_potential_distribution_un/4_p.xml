<p class="p">Under the 2070-MPI RCP 2.6 scenario, the predicted area of the potential habitat in 2070 would be reduced in a similar manner as in the 2070-CCSM RCP 2.6 model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7F</xref>), with the sole exception of the East Himalayas (which do not appear as suitable in the MPI model). As for the MPI, most of the potential habitats are included within the ones for the present time (95.4%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), although the predicted suitable habitats with high probability (0.5‒1) would account for somewhat less (25.6%) of all the area of potential habitats (threshold‒1) (
