<p class="p">Under the 2070-CCSM RCP 8.5 scenario, the area of potential habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">Davidia involucrata</italic> would be reduced (up to 59.1%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8" class="xref">Fig. 8B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and such losses would mainly occur in south-central China. In contrast, there would be a slight area extension in the western margin of its current potential habitats in southwestern China; in the East Himalayas, there would be both gains and losses of potential habitats. The area overlapping with the present potential habitats is still high (about 75%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8" class="xref">Fig. 8C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The suitable habitats with high probability (0.5â€“1) would account for only 36.5% of all the area of potential habitats (thresholds-1) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>).
