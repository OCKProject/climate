<p class="p">Under the 2070-GFDL RCP 2.6 scenario, the potential habitats would be considerably reduced (to 194,921 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; that is, a loss of 63.6% of the present potential area; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), being mainly limited to the western margins of the Sichuan Basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7D</xref>). Most of the potential habitats, however, are included within the present ones (76.3%); the non-overlapping areas of 2070-GFDL RCP 2.6 with the present would be limited to a stretch of land running from the NW Sichuan Basin to SE Gansu (that is, a slight northwestwards expansion), and to a lesser extent, in the East Himalayas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7E</xref>). The suitable habitats having high probability (0.5‒1) would constitute only 20.7% of all the area of potential habitats (threshold‒1) (
