<p class="p">We used scenarios mid-Holocene-CCSM, mid-Holocene-MIROC and mid-Holocene-MPI to model potential climatic habitats of

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and were mainly located in Guizhou and the southern Sichuan Basin. The area further to the west (e.g., the East Himalayas) and the northern areas bordering the Sichuan Basin (except the mid-Holocene MPI) were, in contrast, generally not potential habitats during the mid-Holocene (although the East Himalayas appeared as potential when uncertainty is not taken into account:
