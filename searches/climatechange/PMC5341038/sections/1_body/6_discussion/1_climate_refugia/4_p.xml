<p class="p">It can be concluded that past refugia of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> were restricted to the same locations as contemporary populations (that is, 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> survival, as usually reported for plant species in subtropical China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>, especially the mountains in the Sichuan Basin and its adjacent areas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>). This would probably be true again in the future, although sizes might well be smaller. Being aware of the extent and locations of the future climate refugia of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> in China and the East Himalayan region will help us to implement effective conservation management.
