<p class="p">At the mid-Holocene, although the potential habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> were somewhat reduced probably because of less stable temperature seasonality (bio4) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Figs 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8" class="xref">8</xref>). The potential areas of overlap between the current and future distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> likely serve as 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> macrorefugia of this species from ongoing climate change. Given that no major changes are detected regarding the climatic variables more influential for 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> except for bio1 (annual mean temperature), it seems clear that the expected rise of over 3 °C for the year 2070 would mean that the potential habitats for the species will be limited to the areas that show higher probability (&gt;0.5) of maintaining the current climatic conditions. Only a few further western areas are identified as new climate refugia looking into the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Figs 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8" class="xref">8</xref>). Although the 2070 models that do not take into account for uncertainty show a large expansion towards the west (to the much colder mountains of NW Sichuan, SE Gansu, SE Qinghai and SE Xizang; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs S1V‒Zm</xref>), the “refined” models only show limited range extensions, probably because most of these latter regions, despite being colder, are generally drier (now and in 2070) than the mountains of south-central and southwestern China (and, not suitable for harboring 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> stands).
