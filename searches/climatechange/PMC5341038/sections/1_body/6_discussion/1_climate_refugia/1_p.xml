Thus, a location is classified as a refugium only if the supported population persists to the present. The refugium may represent the entire distribution of a species and be the last holdout before extinction, or be an isolated population that is disjunct from a more extensive distribution elsewhere. Refugia may be located within a former distribution as a result of a range contraction (
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> refugia or climate relicts); such populations persisting through several glacial cycles become long-term refugia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" class="xref">49</xref>. Identifying and characterizing climate refugia provide an important context for understanding the development of modern distributions of species, traits and local adaptation
