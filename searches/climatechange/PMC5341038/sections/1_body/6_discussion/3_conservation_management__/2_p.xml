<p class="p">Besides planning and establishing the protected areas, we further propose to monitor population size and demographic structure of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> and conserve the species 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>, and to implement propagation of the species outside its natural range (as artificial stands in experimental plots), to enhance its chances for long-term survival.
