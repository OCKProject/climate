 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. All the paleoendemic species are habitat specialists. Niche evolution might be impossible for these Tertiary relict trees. They cannot evolve significantly new adaptations or disperse to new localities in the time projected for climate change, nor can they compete with non-paleoendemic evergreen broad-leaved species. Clearly,
