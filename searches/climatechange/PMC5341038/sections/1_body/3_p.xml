<p class="p">Species distribution modeling (SDM) combines species occurrence data with environmental variables, under the assumption that the distribution of known localities reflects survival patterns of species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. SDM has proven useful for estimating such patterns and the resultant risk of extinction. It can produce spatially explicit and comprehensive maps that are particularly valuable for identifying areas where conservation efforts and management strategies are most needed. Our main objective is to apply an SDM approach based on Tertiary relict tree species 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic>â€™s occurrence data and climatic surfaces at four different time points (LGM, mid-Holocene, present, and the year 2070), so as to estimate past distributions of climatically relevant areas, model the present potential distribution range, and predict potential distribution and vulnerability under future climate change. We hypothesize that the mountains of south-central and southwestern China have been long-term stable refugia of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic> and that there would be a decline in areal extent of suitable habitats for this tree species under future climate change. In order to provide a basis for conservation management of 
 <italic class="italic">D. involucrata</italic>, our aim is to map the past, current and future suitable habitat distributions of this paleoendemic species, and propose establishment of protected areas.
