To reduce the rate of species extinctions in a world dominated increasingly by human, natural protected areas are often the strategy on which conservation measures are built. However, in light of global climate change, conservation strategies and decisions regarding the location of protected areas must consider future regional climate changes and their effects on species distribution, including retractions and expansions of species ranges
