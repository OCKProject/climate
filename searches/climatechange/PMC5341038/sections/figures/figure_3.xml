  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) A “standard” model for the present time period is obtained by averaging the multiple runs (20 in our case) from the cross-validation (or from another sampling technique, e.g. subsample); (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) a map showing the variability in the predicted suitable areas among all generated models (20) from the cross-validation (“uncertainty” map); (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) A “refined” map is obtained by removing the pixels that are forecast by &lt;95% of the models (that is, the pixels shaded in yellow, brown and light green). Purple lines: national boundaries between China and India (at issue). Maps were generated using the software ArcGIS v. 9.3.
