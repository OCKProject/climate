The results regarding the mid-Holocene and the LGM demonstrate that south-central and southwestern China have been long-term stable refugia, and that the current distribution is limited to the prehistoric refugia. Given future distribution under six possible climate scenarios, only some parts of the current range of <italic>D. involucrata</italic> in the mid-high mountains of south-central and southwestern China would be maintained, while some shift west into higher mountains would occur. Our results show that the predicted suitable area offering high probability (0.5&#x02012;1) accounts for an average of only 29.2% among the models predicted for the future (2070), making <italic>D. involucrata</italic> highly vulnerable. We assess and propose priority protected areas in light of climate change. The information provided will also be relevant in planning conservation of other paleoendemic species having ecological traits and distribution ranges comparable to those of <italic>D. involucrata</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Since the maximum extension of ice sheets during LGM (Last Glacial Maximum, from 26,000 to 19,000 calendar years before the present, with cold conditions also prevailing until 14,500 yrs ago), the global climate has undergone rapid and remarkable changes toward a generally warmer current level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. To reduce the rate of species extinctions in a world dominated increasingly by human, natural protected areas are often the strategy on which conservation measures are built. However, in light of global climate change, conservation strategies and decisions regarding the location of protected areas must consider future regional climate changes and their effects on species distribution, including retractions and expansions of species ranges<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Determination of the extent of threatened plants&#x02019; response to climate change can be useful in formulating flexible conservation strategies for China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Identifying past, contemporary and future climate refugia of Tertiary relict plants can clarify their conservation significance.</p><p>China enjoys great species diversity, with ca. 30,250 seed plant species. The key areas of south-central China and Indo-Burma (including most parts of Yunnan) are two of the 25 designated global biodiversity hotspots<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Two plant diversity centers with high levels of endemism are located in this region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The area was never covered by extensive, unified ice-sheets, owing in part to its complex topography<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and to moderate cooling as compared to other regions of China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, these areas did not suffer the extreme aridity that is usually associated with the glacial periods: within China, south-central and southwestern areas were those with the smallest LGM precipitation deficits, rainfall being even higher than at present during the autumn and winter seasons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. So the mountains of south-central and southwestern China have had a relatively stable long-term environment, and are now referred to as the Pleistocene glacial refugia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Before and during the Ice Ages, a number of famous gymnosperms such as <italic>Ginkgo, Metasequoia</italic> and <italic>Cathaya</italic> disappeared from the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, and coincidentally, some temperate deciduous broad-leaved tree taxa died off in North America (e.g., <italic>Davidia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; <italic>Tetracentron</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; <italic>Cercidiphyllum</italic> in review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), Europe (e.g., <italic>Tetracentron</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; <italic>Cercidiphyllum</italic> in review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), the Russian Far East (e.g., <italic>Tetracentron</italic> in Kamchatka<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), and Japan (e.g., <italic>Davidia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>; <italic>Tetracentron</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Most of them now only survive in the humid subtropical areas of south-central and southwestern China. A number of these paleoendemics have highly restricted distributions, usually in the form of small, localized populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Refugia represent climatically stable areas and remain a high conservation priority as important sites for the long-term persistence of species. Today, they are in danger of overexploitation. Climate change has also become a great threat to these species and their forests.</p><p><italic>Davidia involucrata</italic> Baill. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) (dove tree or handkerchief tree in English, gongtong or gezishu in Chinese), included in Davidiaceae (by some in Nyssaceae or Cornaceae), is a rare and endangered tree species with small populations restricted to the humid mountains of south-central and southwestern China, mostly confined to the mountains surrounding the Sichuan Basin. The forests containing <italic>D. involucrata</italic> as one of the dominants are mainly scattered at 1300&#x02013;1900&#x02009;m altitude (but at 2300&#x02013;2800&#x02009;m in Yunnan) in areas with cool, foggy and cloudy climatic conditions. At these altitudes, <italic>D. involucrata</italic> co-dominates with other Tertiary relict plants including <italic>Tetracentron, Cercidiphyllum, Tapiscia, Dipteronia, Pterostyrax, Carya, Liquidambar,</italic> and <italic>Decaisnea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>Davidia involucrata</italic> also occurs, but very rarely, between 900&#x02013;1300&#x02009;m, growing with some evergreen broad-leaved trees of <italic>Cyclobalanopsis, Castanopsis, Lithocarpus, Phoebe, Machilus</italic> and <italic>Neolitsea</italic>. No adequate studies have been carried out to estimate the potential impact of climate change on this Tertiary relict species, and so far no conservation strategies that consider climate change have been proposed.</p><p>Species distribution modeling (SDM) combines species occurrence data with environmental variables, under the assumption that the distribution of known localities reflects survival patterns of species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. SDM has proven useful for estimating such patterns and the resultant risk of extinction. It can produce spatially explicit and comprehensive maps that are particularly valuable for identifying areas where conservation efforts and management strategies are most needed. Our main objective is to apply an SDM approach based on Tertiary relict tree species <italic>D. involucrata</italic>&#x02019;s occurrence data and climatic surfaces at four different time points (LGM, mid-Holocene, present, and the year 2070), so as to estimate past distributions of climatically relevant areas, model the present potential distribution range, and predict potential distribution and vulnerability under future climate change. We hypothesize that the mountains of south-central and southwestern China have been long-term stable refugia of <italic>D. involucrata</italic> and that there would be a decline in areal extent of suitable habitats for this tree species under future climate change. In order to provide a basis for conservation management of <italic>D. involucrata</italic>, our aim is to map the past, current and future suitable habitat distributions of this paleoendemic species, and propose establishment of protected areas.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study species and areas</title><p><italic>Davidia involucrata</italic> is a deciduous broad-leaved tree and its fruit stone is heavy and woody, composed of fibers, each nut containing 3&#x02013;6 seeds.

Its relative rarity has also been recognized: the species was already included in the first red book of China (as a &#x0201c;rare&#x0201d; species)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, although in the red list of 2013&#x02014;which follows the internationally recognized IUCN categories&#x02014;the species is listed, surprisingly, as LC (&#x0201c;Least Concern&#x0201d;), that is, with no conservation concerns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. <italic>Davidia involucrata</italic> is scattered in isolated mountain slopes, or in valleys where the soil often contains much gravel, or by streams, or scree slopes harboring unique assemblages of plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Today scattered stands of <italic>D. involucrata</italic> range approximately from 98&#x02013;110&#x000b0;E, 26&#x02013;32&#x000b0;N in south-central and southwestern China, including Hunan, Hubei, Chongqing, Sichuan, southern Shaanxi, southern Gansu, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces. The latitudes are subtropical. Vegetation types in this area are diverse, according to altitudes, mainly including subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests, deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved mixed forests, warm temperate coniferous forests, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests, cold-temperate coniferous forests, alpine scrub and meadow; however, by far most of the vegetation consists of what is commonly referred to as the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. A striking feature is that within the transitional altitudinal zone from subtropical warm and humid evergreen to the temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests, where in some cases there is also an admixture of species of gymnosperms, a number of extant Tertiary relict plant species thrive today<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The climate is dominated by the Asian monsoon system, including the East Asian summer monsoon, the Indian summer monsoon, and the East Asian winter monsoon, with dry continental winds in winter and moist oceanic winds in summer. In general, in the subtropical areas, lands east of longitude 103&#x000b0; are more influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon, while to the west the Indian summer monsoon dominates.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data and distribution modeling</title><p><italic>Davidia involucrata</italic>&#x02019;s occurrence data for the whole of geographic distribution range were compiled from our extensive field survey (carried out within the area comprised between 26&#x02013;32&#x000b0;N and 98&#x02013;110&#x000b0;E), the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (CVH; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cvh.org.cn/">http://www.cvh.org.cn/</ext-link>), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/">www.gbif.org/</ext-link>). Although many records from CVH did not specify latitude and longitude, we were able to geo-reference detailed locations, using only specimens with locations specified in the label information. In total, after removing duplicate records within each pixel (2.5 arc-min, <italic>ca</italic>. 5&#x02009;km), we obtained 203 presence records.</p><p>A set of 19 bioclimatic variables at 2.5 arc-min resolution covering the distribution range (and neighboring areas) of <italic>D. involucrata</italic> under current conditions (<italic>ca</italic>. 1960&#x02013;1990) were downloaded from the WorldClim website (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org">www.worldclim.org</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Although finer resolutions are available (30 arc-sec) for the bioclimatic variables, these may not be appropriate given uncertainties associated with geo-referencing approximate localities (or with geo-reference errors). We designed as the study area a region considerably larger than the current species range (15&#x02013;56&#x000b0;N and 72&#x02013;143&#x000b0;E). Although such an approach may tend to generalize conditions found near the occupied localities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, we have considered most of East Asia as the study area, given the complexity of this region in terms of topography and Neogene biogeographic history (including substantial marine transgressions/regressions) and the need to include also the areas where recent (Pliocene and Pleistocene) <italic>Davidia</italic> fossils have been found.</p><p>As the modeling algorithm, we employed the maximum entropy algorithm as implemented in MaxEnt v. 3.3&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, whose output is a map of habitat suitability ranging from 0 to 1 per grid cell. MaxEnt for species habitat modeling has some advantages compared to other SDM methods, including its convenience, its use of presence-only species records, and a generally excellent predictive performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We used only &#x02018;linear&#x02019; and &#x02018;quadratic&#x02019; feature to avoid producing too complex a model, which could lead to extrapolation errors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The distribution model for <italic>D. involucrata</italic> under current conditions was projected to three time slices: mid-Holocene (ca. 6000&#x02009;yr BP), LGM (ca. 21,000&#x02009;yr BP), and 2070 (average for 2061&#x02013;2080). For both past scenarios, we used paleoclimatic layers simulated by the Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Earth System Model (MIROC-ESM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and the New Earth System Model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-ESM-P: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm/">http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm/</ext-link>). To predict potential shifts of the geographic distribution that might be caused by global climate change, we used three of the models with the best performance among the various available ones that have participated in the 5th Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP5) experiment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>: CCSM4, the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model 3 (GFDL-CM3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and MPI-ESM-LR. The three models were run in two of the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that were used in the Fifth Assessment IPCC report, RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. RCP 2.6 represents the most &#x0201c;benign&#x0201d; scenario (i.e., a likely increase of 0.3&#x02013;1.7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for ca. 2081&#x02013;2100), whereas RCP 8.5 is the most extreme scenario (a likely increase of 2.6&#x02013;4.8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for ca. 2081&#x02013;2100). All 19 bioclimatic variables for both past and future climate scenarios were also downloaded from the WorldClim website, at the same resolution (2.5 arc-min).</p><p>Selection of bioclimatic variables was done as follows: after a correlation analysis in 203 presence points and a random sample of 10000 pseudo-absence points within the study area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), we grouped bioclimatic variables with strong collinearities (i.e., a Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;|0.85|). Then, with all possible combinations of the 19 variables (but excluding those with more than two parameters from the same group of highly correlated variables) we calculated Variance Inflation Factors (VIF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>); datasets with VIF &#x0003e;10 were excluded to avoid multi-collinearity. VIF were calculated using <italic>vif</italic> function of <italic>usdm</italic> package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> in R. The best combination among 6236 candidate parameter combinations was chosen following corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), and consisted of six variables: annual mean temperature (bio1), isothermality (bio3), temperature seasonality (bio4), precipitation seasonality (bio15), precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), and precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19).</p><p>The &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; model was evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation with MaxEnt, with performance assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. AUC scores may range between 0.5 (randomness) and 1 (exact match), with those above 0.9 indicating a good performance of the model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The MaxEnt jackknife analysis was used to evaluate the relative importance of the six bioclimatic variables employed, based on their gain values when used in isolation. In <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation, occurrence data is divided randomly into <italic>k</italic> equal-size groups, and models are built using <italic>k</italic> &#x02212; 1 bins for calibration in each iteration, with the left-out bin used for evaluation; background data are sampled by Maxent from the entire study region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. We applied the maximum sensitivity plus specificity (MSS) logistic threshold, which is very robust with all types of data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, to obtain a map of absence/presence (with the probability of presence shown as continuous values from the threshold to 1). The resulting map, which is the average of the multiple runs from the cross-validation, can be regarded as the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p>As suggested by many authors, uncertainty should be addressed in Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) because it can produce large biases on the niche predictions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and references therein. Thus, although our model performed well (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.982&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.006), a &#x0201c;consensus ensemble approach&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;consensus approach&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> was applied in order to visualize the variability in the predicted suitable areas among all generated models. A map showing such variability (or uncertainty) was obtained as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>): first all 20 continuous projection maps were converted into binary maps (applying the MSS threshold), and then were calculated how many models predict each pixel as a suitable area. Thus, a continuous map with pixels ranging from 0 to 20 was obtained. Converting these values to probabilities (i.e., 0 as 0%, 10 as 50%, or 20 as 100%), we finally obtained an estimate of each pixel&#x02019;s probability of being predicted as suitable area. Every pixel for which at least 95% of the models (i.e., 19 of 20 and 20 of 20) forecast species presence was regarded as a pixel of high probability of being predicted by modeling (&#x0201c;presence pixel&#x0201d;). In an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in our models, those pixels not ranking as &#x0201c;presence pixels&#x0201d; were removed from the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; output maps to obtain a &#x0201c;refined&#x0201d; model where only those predicted areas with 95% of confidence are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>), and this procedure was applied for the present time and for all past and future scenarios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).

The combination of distributional, genetic, and biological information can be used to conserve <italic>D. involucrata</italic> and nearby Tertiary relict species through effective and efficient management planning in the Nature Reserve system and in other management activities (e.g., translocations).</p><p>Besides planning and establishing the protected areas, we further propose to monitor population size and demographic structure of <italic>D. involucrata</italic> and conserve the species <italic>in situ</italic>, and to implement propagation of the species outside its natural range (as artificial stands in experimental plots), to enhance its chances for long-term survival.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Tang, C.
