  <title class="title">Schematic of linked processes across the aquatic—terrestrial interface in a flood pulse river—floodplain system like the Chobe River in Botswana.</title>
  <p class="p">Hydrological, geomorphological, sedimentary, and ecological processes influence fecal microbial dynamics, water quality, and human waterborne disease risk in surface-water-dependent populations. These interactions are coupled to sociocultural and economic processes, influencing landscape change and exposure to waterborne disease, feeding back to further environmental degradation and pathogen pollution potential.</p>
