  <title class="title">The study was conducted in northern Botswana in Southern Africa.</title>
  <p class="p">The Chobe River (blue line) is a transboundary waterway and 1 of only 3 perennial sources of water within Botswana, with water flow (light blue arrow) moving from the national park towards the urban areas, where the water treatment facility is located (blue X). Water quality samples were collected biweekly at established transect points (black triangles). Surface waters are abstracted to produce drinking water through centralized water treatment facilities and distributed to the population. Circles represent buildings color coded by the type of infrastructure (agricultural, commercial, residential, or tourism related; see legend). In this system, annual floods are driven by distant and regional wet season precipitation, with the largest input arising from floodwaters that occur in association with tropical rains in the upper watersheds of the Zambian and Angolan Highlands (inset, northern aspect of the Cuando-Chobe River Basin). The peak of the flood pulse arrives in the Chobe River at the end of the wet season/beginning of the dry season, after traversing more than 1,000 km from the highland areas.</p>
