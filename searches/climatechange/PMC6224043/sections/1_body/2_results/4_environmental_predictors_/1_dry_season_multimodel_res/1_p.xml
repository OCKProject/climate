 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A.1</xref>. River height lagged 1 week, and maximum temperature lagged 1 and 4 weeks had the highest weighted importance within all model subsets. Indeed, average coefficient estimates and variable importance did not differ greatly between model subsets with different
