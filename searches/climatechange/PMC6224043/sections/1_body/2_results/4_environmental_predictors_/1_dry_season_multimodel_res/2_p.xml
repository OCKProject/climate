<p class="p">As the Chobe River height decreases during the dry season, floodwaters drain back into the channel from the surrounding floodplains. Multimodel inference estimates indicated that a 1-meter decrease in river height in the dry season was associated with a 16.7% (1-week lag) and a 16.1% (4-week lag) increase in under-5 diarrhea cases. Maximum temperature had a more complex relationship with diarrheal disease, with a positive influence on diarrheal disease initially at the 1-week lag but a negative relationship when lagged by 4 weeks.</p>
