<p class="p">Average coefficients and variable importance estimates in the wet season also did not vary widely between model subsets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A.2</xref>). Rainfall lagged 8 weeks was the most important predictor of under-5 diarrhea in the wet season. Each additional 10 mm of rainfall lagged 8 weeks was associated with a 6.5% increase in under-5 diarrhea incidence. Minimum temperature lagged 1 week had moderate importance in 2 model averages, which estimated a 5.8% increase in diarrhea for every 1 Â°C decrease.
