<p class="p">We also tested the data using distributed lag nonlinear models, which allow for nonlinear relationships between predictors and the outcome variable. All environmental variables were included as predictors (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, and river height) lagged from 0 to 8 weeks. The results generally agreed with the results presented above. In the dry season, decreasing river height was associated with a significantly higher risk of diarrheal disease at lag weeks 4–6. In the wet season, higher rainfall was associated with larger diarrhea risk at lag weeks 7 and 8. Associations between other environmental variables and diarrhea incidence were generally nonsignificant, which may be due to our moderate sample size. Of note, the estimated exposure—response relationships were relatively linear, which supports our use of generalized linear model multimodel inference above.
