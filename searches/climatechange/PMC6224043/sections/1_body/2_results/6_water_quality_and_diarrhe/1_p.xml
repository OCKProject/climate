<p class="p">Univariate regression analyses showed that both TSS and

 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> concentrations were significantly associated with under-5 diarrheal disease (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002688.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). TSS had a positive association with diarrhea incidence in the dry season unlagged (beta = 0.060, 95% CI = 0.180, 0.102), lagged 3 weeks (beta = 0.041, 95% CI = 0.008, 0.073), and lagged 4 weeks (beta = 0.042, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.080). In contrast, TSS had a significantly negative relationship with under-5 diarrhea in the wet season lagged 2 weeks (beta = −0.098, 95% CI = −0.151, −0.045) and 6 weeks (beta = −0.063, 95% CI = −0.119, −0.007). 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> had an unlagged positive association with diarrheal incidence in both the wet season (beta = 0.003, 95% CI = 0.001, 0.004) and the dry season, associated with rare rainfall events (beta = 0.011, 95% CI = 0.003, 0.017).
