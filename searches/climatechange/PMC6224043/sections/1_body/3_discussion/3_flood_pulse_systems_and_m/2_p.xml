<p class="p">Typically, human health impacts are associated with the rise in water levels and advancement of floodwaters, although the timing of this relationship can be complicated [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Cholera in the Bengal Delta region provides an important contrasting example. In this system, cholera outbreaks occur biannually, a pattern that is unique to this region [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Here, the flood pulse is important in distributing the cholera pathogen, with disease outbreaks corresponding to high flood levels and water movement distributing pathogens across floodplains. This contrast suggests that differences in pathogen reservoirs (aquatic versus terrestrial) play a critical role in the timing of diarrhea—flood relationships and human exposure dynamics. Advancing our understanding of these human—environment couplings will provide critical insight into forecasting flood—waterborne disease dynamics across different landscapes—including for emerging diseases—by pathogen type.
