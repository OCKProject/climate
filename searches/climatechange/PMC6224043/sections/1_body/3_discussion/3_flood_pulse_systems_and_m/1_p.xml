In such flood pulse systems, floodplain environments are periodically flooded with sediment, with fecal microbial transport occurring between the floodplain and the river channel [

The character of the flood pulse (alternating cycles of increased water flow, volume, inundation, and draining) establishes the degree of connectivity, with lateral exchange of matter and microbial organisms including waterborne pathogens moving across hydrological connectivity gradients [
