<p class="p">From dryland to tropical systems, surface water plays a critical role in human health. Floods and rainfall variability are expected to increase under climate change across many systems and can induce dramatic shifts in surface water quality. While presenting a clear risk in populations using unsafe water sources, rapid change in suspended solids and other water quality parameters may overwhelm conventional water treatment processes, impacting the provision of safe drinking water and increasing the potential for waterborne pathogen exposure and diarrheal disease. Long-term solutions to diarrheal disease and climate preparedness should include increased national focus on water sector development using technologies that are robust to local environmental conditions but can be serviced and maintained locally. In populations with high HIV burdens, expansion of diarrheal disease surveillance and intervention strategies might be needed, engaging other at-risk sectors beyond the under-5 age group. Ultimately, the success of public health strategies across systems will depend on understanding how sociocultural and environmental factors are coupled across scales and influence waterborne disease exposure risk, transmission dynamics, and population vulnerability in the face of expected climate change.</p>
