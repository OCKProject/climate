<p class="p">Flood pulse dynamics in the Chobe River arise from precipitation events in catchment headwaters more than 1,000 miles away and determine the magnitude, duration, and timing of river flow and consequent effects on dry season diarrheal disease in downstream populations. Climate controls on hydrometeorological conditions can vary significantly across a watershed. For example, rainfall in the Angolan Highlands catchment area is driven by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Congo Air Boundary even as more local circulation changes contribute to the increasingly arid conditions experienced in Botswana in the interior of Southern Africa. Distant meteorological events and teleconnections associated with, for instance, the Walker circulation can further influence diverging climate dynamics (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]). As these hydrometeorological processes are intimately linked with diarrheal disease incidence, we can expect shifts in diarrheal disease patterns to be responsive to both local and distant climate dynamics and associated changes under climate change. It is evident that exclusive use of local or country-level climate data would be inadequate to forecast climate impacts on diarrheal disease in this region. It is further evident that clumping regions into larger diarrheal disease studies likely masks critical information necessary to understand environmentalâ€”health relationships and climate vulnerabilities.
