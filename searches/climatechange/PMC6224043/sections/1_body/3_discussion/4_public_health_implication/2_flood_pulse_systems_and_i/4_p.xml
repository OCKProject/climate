<p class="p">Many treatment facilities in Africa and elsewhere, however, rely on manual control strategies to determine the coagulation doses needed for water treatment [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Even when elevations in TSS levels are detected, calculation of the optimum coagulant dose is complex and nonlinear, further complicating successful application of manual approaches [

Failure of the operator and/or equipment in water treatment plants to detect and account for these fluxes when applying chemical dosing can compromise water quality as the coagulation step has crucial influence on disinfection and microorganism removal [
