<p class="p">In developing countries, much attention has been focused on household treatment of water as a primary public health intervention for diarrheal disease [

Many of these regions have water treatment plants that are operational, but clean water is not consistently available. In this study, households in the 8 villages had access to and reported utilizing improved water produced by centralized water processing plants (97% [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]). This infrastructure should protect the population from in-river water quality declines and waterborne disease, yet biannual diarrheal outbreaks continue to occur, coinciding with degraded river water quality. While numerous factors may influence the ability of water treatment and distribution systems to provide clean water to a population, hydrological variability as observed in this system across seasons can create extreme shifts in TSS levels (which include natural organic material [NOM]), alkalinity, and pH, presenting a challenge to conventional water treatment processes.
