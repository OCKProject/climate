<p class="p">Elevations in suspended solids not only influence microbial survival in the river but also through the water treatment facility if these elevations are not detected and accounted for in the treatment process. Conventional water treatment includes a coagulation step, which involves the application of chemicals to remove suspended solids (sediments and NOM) from the water into large floc aggregates that are subsequently eliminated through sedimentation and filtration steps [
