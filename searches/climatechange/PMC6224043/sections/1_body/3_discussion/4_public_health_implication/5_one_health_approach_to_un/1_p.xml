<p class="p">Pathogen-specific transmission pathways and host exposure and infection dynamics interact in particular ways with environmental and socioecological variables to influence the occurrence of diarrheal disease across populations and landscapes, predominantly in regions of poverty, where environmental exposures are enhanced, as is vulnerability to climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). These interdependent influences complicate simple climateâ€”diarrheal disease evaluations, affecting the development of sustainable interventions. While critical hydrometeorological drivers were associated with in-river water quality declines and diarrheal disease outbreaks in this study, this is only part of the story. For example, our previous work in this system has identified significant associations between the spatial and temporal patterns of dry season

 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> and TSS increases, protected land use, floodplain habitat, and riparian fecal counts from elephant and other wildlife [

 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> concentrations in the early wet season above the water treatment plant intake.
