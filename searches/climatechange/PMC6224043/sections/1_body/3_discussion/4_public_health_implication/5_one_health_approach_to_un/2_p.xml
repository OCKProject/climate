<p class="p">These findings identify important couplings between flood pulse dynamics, seasonal fluxes in wildlife densities, land use, and water quality, with impacts on safe drinking water and diarrheal disease in children and adults. The complexity of the couplings in this system underscore the need for the inclusion of dimensions not normally considered part of the domain of public health. This is particularly true for emerging infectious diseases influenced by environmental processes and consequently expected to be impacted by climate change.</p>
