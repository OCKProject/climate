<p class="p">Under climate change, rainfall variability is expected to increase across Southern Africa in the 21st century, with a spread in the rainfall probability distribution, increasing the frequency of droughts, extreme rainfall events, and floods in the future [

Predicted increases in hydrological extremes associated with climate change will further elevate the vulnerability of populations dependent on surface water resources in these landscapes.
