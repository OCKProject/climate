<p class="p">In this system, the presence of surface water and flood pulse dynamics in a riverâ€”floodplain system had a significant association with diarrheal disease case reports in children under 5 years of age as well as all other age groups reporting to health facilities. Timing of seasonal outbreaks differed from that observed at the level of the country, where surface water is largely absent [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], highlighting the important influence landscape characteristics can have on disease dynamics and population vulnerability. In this study, diarrheal incidence was highest on average in the dry season in August, with the second outbreak occurring in the wet season towards the end of January. Importantly, the timing of outbreaks was similar across age groups. Important seasonal differences were identified in the average number of diarrheal cases reported for the age groups 1 to 4 years and 5 years and over (

The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to lower immunocompetence in the youngest children relative to the other age groups and greater general susceptibility to waterborne pathogen communities across seasons. Diarrhea type also varied significantly by season (
