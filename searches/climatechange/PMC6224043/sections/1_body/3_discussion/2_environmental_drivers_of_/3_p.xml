<p class="p">In our analysis, cross-validation results reveal important heterogeneity in the ability of our environmental models to accurately predict diarrheal case reports across the 8-study villages. Diarrheal disease as a syndrome is complex, driven by a variety of pathogens, each varying in their transmission and persistence dynamics in the system, elements that will vary, together with environmental drivers, within and between years. Sociocultural influences will also shape exposures, secondary transmission, and case detection. These complexities are evident in the demographic and clinical variation seen by season in the outpatient data. However, across models, river height lagged 1 week in the dry season and rainfall lagged 8 weeks in the wet season remained consistently important across all years in predicting diarrheal disease case reports.</p>
