 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], rainfall has been identified as a critical predictor of diarrheal disease. Consistent with these studies, rainfall with an 8-week lag had a significant influence on under-5 diarrhea, with a 10-mm increase in rainfall associated with an estimated 6.5% rise in the number of cases reported. Rainfall, minimum temperature, and river height were all associated with increases in
