 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) and was linked to maximum temperature and flood height, with a 1-m drop in floodwaters during floodwater recession from floodplains associated with a significant increase in diarrheal cases of 16.7% and 16.1% lagged 1 and 4 weeks, respectively (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002688.s002" class="xref">S2</xref>). River TSS levels were strongly predicted by river height and had a significant positive association with diarrhea in the dry season (lagged 0, 3, and 4 weeks; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002688.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Here, as floodwaters receded from surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased within the river channel. Differences in lagged relationships suggest that hierarchical environmental processes are occurring, where primary source exposure and secondary transmission dynamics may further contribute to variation in the observed timing of environmentalâ€”health couplings.
