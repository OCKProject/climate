<p class="p">Multimodel inference was carried out using groups of candidate regression models, each developed with the same structure but different predictor variables. Under-5 diarrhea observations, which are overdispersed count data, were modeled using negative binomial regression. 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> and TSS concentration data were Gaussian in structure and were modeled using ordinary least squares regression. Models for under-5 diarrhea were developed using all combinations of 12 different environmental variables: minimum temperature (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), maximum temperature (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), rainfall (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), and Chobe River height (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks). Models for 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> or TSS included the same environmental variables lagged 0 and 4 weeks. These lag times were chosen to represent the acute (0/1 week), short-term (4 week), and long-term (8 week) effects of environmental variability. All regressions included a dummy variable for year and an autoregressive term (diarrhea incidence lagged 1 week) as predictor variables. This resulted in 4,096 candidate models of under-5 diarrhea for both the wet and dry season, and 256 candidate models for both 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> and TSS for each season. In summary, within a multimodel ensemble, every model had the same regression structure (either Gaussian or negative binomial) and included a dummy variable for year and an autoregressive term. The only differences between the models were the environmental variables included as predictors.
