<p class="p">These top model sets were used to calculate averaged variable coefficients and relative variable importance. The average coefficient for variable 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> was calculated by taking a weighted average of the coefficient estimates for variable 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> from each subset model. Each coefficient estimate was weighted by the Akaike weight of its respective model. Relative variable importance is a measure of how often a predictor variable is included in the best performing models. The relative importance of variable 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> was calculated by adding the Akaike weights of all models that included variable 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> as a predictor. These importance measurements do not add up to 1 because models can include multiple environmental predictors.
