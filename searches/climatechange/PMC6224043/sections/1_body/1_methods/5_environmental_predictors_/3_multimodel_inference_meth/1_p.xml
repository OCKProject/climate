<p class="p">Five different subsets of the candidate models were created by (1) retaining all models, (2) selecting models with all coefficients statistically significant at

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.10, (4) selecting models with all coefficients statistically significant at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and (5) selecting only the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion, corrected for the small sample size relative to the number of parameters used in each model (AICc). The Akaike weight of each model within the subset was then calculated. Akaike weights provide a relative likelihood that a specific model is the best model in a given subset [
