<p class="p">Three separate analyses were performed to determine the associations between environmental variables and weekly under-5 diarrhea cases, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic>, and TSS. The analyses differed only in the outcome of interest and the basic structure of the models. Since water quality variables were measured over a shorter time period, the models predicting 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic> and TSS included fewer observations (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 42 [wet season], 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 54 [dry season]) than models without water quality variables (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 164 [wet season], 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 236 [dry season]). A priori, we believed that different environmental drivers were important for the dry and wet season outbreaks of diarrhea in children under 5. Hence, analyses were performed separately for the wet and dry seasons.
