<p class="p">Multimodel averaged predictions are simply the Akaike weighted average of the subset constituent model predictions. Pseudo 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>-squared was calculated for the averaged model, top model, and null model by squaring the correlation between the averaged predictions and observations of weekly diarrhea. In addition, leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was performed by omitting 1 year of data from model fitting and then generating and evaluating model averaged predictions for the missing year. Because our models include a dummy variable for year, which cannot be estimated for the omitted year, correlation rather than root mean square error (RMSE) was used to evaluate model predictive performance.
