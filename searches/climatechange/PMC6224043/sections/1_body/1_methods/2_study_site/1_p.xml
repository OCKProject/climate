<p class="p">Botswana is a semiarid, landlocked country in Southern Africa. The country has a subtropical climate with annual wet (November—March) and dry (April—October) seasons. Intra- and inter-annual precipitation variability is high, resulting in frequent droughts and flooding. This study focuses on Chobe District, located in the northeastern part of Botswana (

The Chobe River floodplain system, which is the primary source of water for the district, floods annually (flood pulse), with the peak flood height occurring in the late wet season/early dry season (April). The district contains 1 primary hospital, 3 private clinics, and 12 government health clinics that serve a total population of approximately 25,000 people (Central Statistics Office of Botswana, 2011). Medical services are provided by the government, with patients paying a nominal fee for health services. Chobe District is also home to the Chobe National Park, which provides an important habitat for the largest elephant population in Africa, as well as an abundance of other wildlife species (
