<p class="p">The Chobe River supplies all domestic water needs for the study villages (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8), providing a unique environment to assess the impact of surface water dynamics on the health of dependent populations. Water is pumped directly from the river into a conventional water treatment plant and then distributed through direct reticulation to households (private outdoor and indoor taps) or to public taps [

Turbidity and pH are measured manually; values are used to determine the amount of coagulant that is automatically deployed over time in the water treatment process. A second fully automated plant was deployed in 2014, serving 2 out of the 8 study villages. Since 2016, frequent—daily and sometimes multiple daily—water purges occur in the second system, which continues to date. The majority of households have access to improved sanitation, with only 14% of households reporting lack of access in a recent survey of 3 of the study villages, most frequently due to pit latrines being at capacity [
