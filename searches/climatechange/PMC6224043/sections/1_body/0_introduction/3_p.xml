<p class="p">Botswana provides an ideal model system to isolate the role of surface water and flood dynamics on climateâ€”diarrheal disease couplings. Botswana is an arid to semiarid country in Southern Africa with only 3 sources of permanent surface water throughout the country. Rainfall is limited and only occurs during a defined wet season, with little or no rainfall during the dry season. At the national level, diarrheal disease remains a persistent health threat to children and adults alike [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Using this study system and a unique dataset, we evaluated the influence of meteorology, surface water quality, and flood pulse dynamics on diarrheal disease and discuss the implications for public health and climate preparedness needs in systems where populations are dependent on surface water resources.
