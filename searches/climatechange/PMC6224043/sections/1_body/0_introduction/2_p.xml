<p class="p">Floods are identified as the most pervasive hydrometeorological hazard (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]), are expected to increase in frequency under climate change [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and are linked strongly with the occurrence of diarrheal disease outbreaks in affected populations [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, flood and flow regimes can vary significantly by waterway, and range from large rivers in temperate regions with more regular flow to dryland river—floodplain systems in arid and semiarid regions where highly variable flow occurs annually (flood pulse), with extreme flooding as well as droughts a common outcome [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In flood pulse systems, there is a predictable advance of floodwaters onto surrounding floodplains and retraction back into the river channel with flood recession, linking aquatic and terrestrial landscapes and microbial communities. These annual flood dynamics are highly variable and can change dramatically in flow volume, duration, frequency, and timing [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. These systems tend to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with system behavior and biota characterized by flood dynamics and the geomorphology of the river—floodplain system [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. These interacting hydrological, geomorphological, and sedimentary processes are fundamental determinants of microbial dynamics, water quality, and waterborne pathogen exposure in humans and animals in flood-prone areas but have not yet been adequately characterized, hampering our ability to address current and climate-mediated population vulnerabilities.
