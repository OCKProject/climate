 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Worldwide, degraded water quality, waterborne disease, and infectious diarrhea remain prominent and persistent concerns that are expected to worsen under future climate change projections [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Of these, nearly half a million deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age, with the greatest burden of disease focused in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Chronic oral exposure to fecal contaminates is also linked to environmental enteropathy, a subclinical disorder marked by chronic gut inflammation, small bowel structural change, decreased gut permeability, and gut immune dysfunction, which can influence oral vaccine efficacy [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The societal impact of diarrheal disease in children can be lasting, underscoring the need to advance our understanding of environmental couplings to develop effective public health strategies that will not only reduce current disease burdens but minimize future climate change impacts.
