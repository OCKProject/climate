  <title class="title">Nonlinear exposure—response relationships between rainfall and diarrhea incidence in the wet season.</title>
  <p class="p">These relationships were generated using distributed lag nonlinear models that controlled for minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, and year. Relative risk estimates (black lines) and confidence intervals (grey areas) are shown across different rainfall levels (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis). All relative risks are in reference to rainfall of 0 mm. (A—H) represent the response functions at lag weeks 1 through 8. We can see from (G) and (H) that increases in rainfall at lag weeks 7 and 8 are associated with increased risk of diarrheal disease.
