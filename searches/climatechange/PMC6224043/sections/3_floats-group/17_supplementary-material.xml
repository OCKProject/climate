  <p class="p">The rows represent the seasonal data and the model structure (i.e., averaged model with environmental predictors or null model without environmental predictors) used to fit the model. The columns indicate the omitted year, which was also used to test model prediction accuracy. Table values represent the correlation of the averaged model prediction with the observation for the omitted year.</p>
