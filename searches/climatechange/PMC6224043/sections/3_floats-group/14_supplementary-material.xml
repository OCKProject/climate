  <title class="title">Nonlinear exposure—response relationships between river height and diarrhea incidence in the dry season.</title>
  <p class="p">These relationships were generated using distributed lag nonlinear models that controlled for minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, and year. Relative risk estimates (black lines) and confidence intervals (grey areas) are shown across different river height levels (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis). All relative risks are in reference to a river height increase of 6 m. (A—H) represent the response functions at lag weeks 1 through 8. We can see from (D—F) that declines in river height at lag weeks 4–6 are associated with increased risk of diarrheal disease.
