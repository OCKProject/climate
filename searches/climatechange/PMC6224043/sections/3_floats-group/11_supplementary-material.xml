  <title class="title">Dry season average coefficients and variable importance using standardized diarrhea data.</title>
  <p class="p">Summary of multimodel inference predicting under-5 diarrhea (standardized). The rows of the table represent each environmental variable at 1-, 4-, and 8-week lags. The columns of the table represent different model selection criteria, i.e., average coefficient estimates for each environmental variable derived from different model subsets. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of models that were averaged in a given model subset. Lastly, the colors indicate the weighted importance of each variable within the model subset, with 1 being the highest possible weighted importance. “NaN” indicates that a variable was not used in any of the models within a model subset.</p>
