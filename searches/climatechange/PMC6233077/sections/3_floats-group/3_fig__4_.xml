  <p class="p">Caterpillar fungus production increases at higher elevations and colder winter temperatures. The probability of high, medium, and low production levels along a winter temperature gradient is shown at three representative elevations (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>). Points depict where regions fall along the production gradient, based on their habitat areas’ mean environmental conditions (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>). Production probabilities are the result of ordered logistic regressions using collection data from 33 administrative units. Dashed vertical lines mark −4 °C, the approximate temperature threshold beyond which the species distribution models predicted little suitable habitat. “Other Qinghai” and “Southern Gansu” include habitat south of the Yellow River. Northern areas of Qinghai and Gansu have mean temperatures below −12 °C during the coldest quarter. MTCQ, mean temperature of the coldest quarter. (See
