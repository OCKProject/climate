  <p class="p">LEK of caterpillar fungus production through time. Points represent the mean proportion of responses for each type of change observation (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) and their perceived causes (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>), calculated across all studies conducted in a given year, and weighted by the level of confidence in each study. Regression lines show temporal trends for each response but should not be used for inference. Annually aggregated responses about changes are based on data from 29 studies (including this one) and &gt;817 interviewees (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>); responses about causes are from 22 studies and &gt;413 interviewees (
