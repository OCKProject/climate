<p class="p">Here, we examine how multiple anthropogenic factors are affecting a niche commodity throughout its range. We investigate whether caterpillar fungus production is decreasing regionally, and if so, why. We follow a multiple evidence base approach that makes use of data from field interviews in Tibet, a systematic literature review, official collection records, and regional climate data. We weigh the evidence for whether overexploitation and climate change are affecting its production by synthesizing findings from the LEK of those involved in its collection and trade, assessing the environmental conditions that determine both the spatial extent of its range and its production within a location, and analyzing how the climatic factors important to its growth have changed in recent decades. We demonstrate how complementary insights from LEK and Western science can improve understanding of valuable biological resources, illuminate multiple threats to their sustainability, and identify hotspots of vulnerability.</p>
