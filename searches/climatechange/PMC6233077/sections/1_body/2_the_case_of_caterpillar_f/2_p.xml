<p class="p">The intensity of the harvesting boom in environmentally and economically marginal areas has led to widespread concern over the ecological and social sustainability of caterpillar fungus collection (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Each May to June, collectors dig infected caterpillars out of the ground with the fungus still attached, typically before it begins producing spores, because reproductively mature specimens are considered undesirable by consumers (

 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). This harvesting strategy is expected to have a negative effect on long-term population dynamics. Assessing trends in caterpillar fungus remains difficult due to spatially and temporally patchy records of collection amounts, with even less data on collection effort (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Although case studies assert that production is decreasing because of high collection pressure and ecosystem degradation (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), such claims are location-specific and often rely on inconclusive evidence or an incomplete understanding of the fungus’ life cycle (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Climate change has also been invoked as causing changes in caterpillar fungus abundance (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). While correlative modeling studies found associations between climatic conditions and caterpillar fungus habitat, they predicted both net range expansions and contractions under future climate scenarios (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Little attention has been paid to how recent climate change may have already affected caterpillar fungus (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>), despite a growing understanding of how it has altered Himalayan ecosystems, causing vegetation changes and permafrost thaw in the regions inhabited by the fungus (
