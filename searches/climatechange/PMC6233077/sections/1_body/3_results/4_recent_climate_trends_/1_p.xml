Linear regressions of climatic conditions each year from 1979–2013 revealed that winter temperatures have warmed significantly during this period across nearly all caterpillar fungus habitats in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, as well as around Lhasa and Qinghai Lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Winter warming has been strongest in Bhutan, with mean winter temperatures increasing by 3.5–4 °C across most of its predicted habitat (+1.1 °C per decade, on average), pushing all but the highest-elevation areas close to the −4 °C winter temperature threshold identified by the species distribution models. Changes in precipitation have been spatially heterogeneous, with large areas of caterpillar fungus habitat experiencing significant reductions in summer precipitation, while others have experienced significant increases. Winter precipitation has also increased significantly over much of the Tibetan Plateau. However, parts of Nepal and Bhutan have undergone significant winter drying trends, with the largest proportional decreases in winter precipitation concentrated in Bhutan’s most productive caterpillar fungus administrative unit, Wangduephodrang.
