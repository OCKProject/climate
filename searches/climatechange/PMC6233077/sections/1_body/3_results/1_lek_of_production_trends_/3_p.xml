<p class="p">In the past decade, overexploitation was the dominant cause reported in Bhutan, Nepal, and India. Within China, overexploitation was also the dominant cause reported in Qinghai, while climate change was dominant in Tibet and Sichuan, followed closely by interannual weather fluctuations in Tibet and overexploitation in Sichuan. Habitat degradation was noted, although less frequently, in all countries except Nepal, mostly in the form soil degradation. This was related to impacts of caterpillar fungus harvesting in about half of the cases. The highest proportion of climate change responses were from our interviewees in central Tibet, who mentioned warming and drying trends as problematic for caterpillar fungus production. Collectors in Dolpa, Nepal who cited climate change reported decreasing winter snow (66%), earlier spring snowmelt (52%), and warming (38%) as causes of decreasing production (
