 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>), 94.5% of our 400 caterpillar fungus occurrences and 93.9% of the habitat predicted by the species distribution models fell outside of areas likely to have permafrost. In regions where permafrost is present (excluding three provinces on the eastern Tibetan Plateau with little permafrost), caterpillar fungus occurs at its margin, with a median distance of 3.2 km between caterpillar fungus occurrence locations and their nearest likely permafrost areas (mean = 5.6 km, SD = 7.4 km,
