<p class="p">To increase our understanding of the environmental conditions associated with suitable caterpillar fungus habitat throughout the Himalayan region, we created four species-distribution models. Each of the models showed strong predictive performance according to a suite of evaluation statistics (

 </ext-link>). The models consistently ranked precipitation of the wettest or coldest quarter (i.e., monsoon rainfall or winter precipitation), nonvegetated cover, and elevation as the most important predictors of habitat, followed by mean temperature of the coldest quarter (i.e., winter temperature) (

 </ext-link>). Precipitation seasonality and isothermality were least influential overall and were removed by two of the four models. Several of the variables’ response curves exhibit well-defined ranges, indicating that, with all other variables held at their means, habitat suitability is highest at elevations between 3,200 and 4,900 m, with ∼15–55% nonvegetated cover, and with mean winter temperatures between −15 °C and −5 °C, declining steeply at temperatures warmer than −4 °C (
