<p class="p">On average, core production areas on the Tibetan Plateau (Nagchu, Yushul, and Golog) were predicted to be among the highest-producing due to their cold winter temperatures and relatively high elevations (

Low-producing areas closest to the −4 °C winter temperature threshold, above which the species distribution models predicted little suitable habitat, include Arunachal Pradesh, Yunnan, and Bhutan. However, there is more environmental heterogeneity within these regions than can be captured by their means: for example, along steep elevation gradients in the southern Himalaya (
