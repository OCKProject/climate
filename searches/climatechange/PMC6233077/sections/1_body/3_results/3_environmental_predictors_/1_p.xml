<p class="p">We then examined how the key environmental predictors of caterpillar fungus habitat relate to its production level at a subregional scale. We grouped administrative units into low (&lt;0.26), medium (0.26–0.72), and high (&gt;0.72) production levels (kg km
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) based on mean collection amounts across multiple years, where available, divided by the predicted habitat area in each administrative unit. Ordered logistic regressions to determine the environmental conditions associated with these production levels generated three models with similar levels of support (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The models indicated that within suitable habitat areas, the production level of caterpillar fungus increases at higher elevations and where there are drier and colder winters. Inclusion of winter precipitation led to higher production estimates in the drier, central Tibetan Plateau. The most parsimonious model showed that the odds of caterpillar fungus production moving to a higher production level increase by 57%, on average, with every 100-m increase in elevation and decrease by 64% with every 1° increase in mean winter temperature, with the other variables held constant (
