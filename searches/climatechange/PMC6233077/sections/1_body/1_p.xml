<p class="p">A more complete understanding of how these factors are affecting species and ecosystems can be achieved by bringing together insights from different knowledge systems in a “multiple evidence base” approach (

While Western science is well-suited to quantifying phenomena across large spatial extents, particularly through the use of remotely sensed data, local ecological knowledge (LEK) qualitatively integrates observations across many variables and longer timescales than are typically possible for scientific field studies (

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). Because people who depend on an ecosystem for their livelihoods over many years tend to be well-attuned to its dynamics, their LEK can give insight into complex issues, such as climate change and species declines (
