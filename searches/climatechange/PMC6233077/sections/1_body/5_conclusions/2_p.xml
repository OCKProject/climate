<p class="p">Combining Western scientific methods with local environmental knowledge proved crucial for understanding recent trends in caterpillar fungus in the Himalayas. While environmental modeling highlighted the influence of climate change on the decline in caterpillar fungus populations, local environmental knowledge emphasized the role of local harvesting pressure. Harvesters gave insight into population trends where quantitative data were largely lacking or underestimated due to hidden flows, such as those associated with poaching. Our integration of LEK from multiple locations provided a synoptic view and more complete understanding across the speciesâ€™ range and through time. Meanwhile, Western scientific methods allowed relationships to be quantitatively analyzed at a regional scale to understand the role of global change factors, which are not always well-captured by site-specific knowledge.</p>
