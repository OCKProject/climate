<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">The sustainability of the caterpillar fungus ecology and economy is threatened by the combined pressures of climate change and overexploitation for traditional medicine. Based on the geographic distribution of the caterpillar fungus, we infer that it requires winter temperatures well below 0 Â°C, while avoiding permanently frozen soil. Such conditions are typically present at the margin of permafrost areas. Our study revealed that, outside of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, nearly all recorded caterpillar fungus locations are within a narrow distance of areas likely underlain by permafrost. Given that winter temperatures have warmed significantly from 1979 to 2013 across much of its range, and especially in Bhutan, its populations are likely to have been negatively affected. However, an upward shift in the elevation of permafrost and thus of potential caterpillar fungus habitat in response to changing climate will not necessarily be accompanied by simultaneous shifts in the caterpillar species, the fungus, and the vegetation and edaphic conditions on which they depend.</p>
