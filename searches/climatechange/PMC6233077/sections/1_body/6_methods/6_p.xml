Although collection amounts are subject to underreporting and cannot perfectly approximate the amount of caterpillar fungus growing each year, we assume that collection quantities are a reasonable proxy for true production quantities, given that harvesters in many areas search exhaustively for it. To determine how environmental factors relate to production amounts, we performed ordered logistic regressions with production bin as the outcome, and with the variables selected by a majority of the species distribution models as the predictors.
