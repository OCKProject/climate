<p class="p">To triangulate how the habitat area relates to permafrost—another aspect of Himalayan ecosystems affected by climate and topography—we overlaid the caterpillar fungus presence points and predicted habitat area on a global permafrost map (
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>). We then calculated the proportion of points and habitat area in regions likely to have permafrost, as well as the average distance from presence points to likely permafrost areas. Because the permafrost map itself is a modeled output derived from similar inputs to those used in our species distribution models, we did not include it in our habitat models to avoid confounding the caterpillar fungus–climate relationships.
