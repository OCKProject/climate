<p class="p">In June 2017, we conducted semistructured interviews with caterpillar fungus collectors, local traders, and community leaders in Sichuan, Qinghai, and the Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet), China (with approval from Stanford Universityâ€™s Internal Review Board, protocol 41289). After obtaining oral informed consent, we asked interviewees open-ended questions about their perceptions of whether caterpillar fungus production amounts were changing, and why. If they reported decreasing amounts, we asked them to specify whether these were true decreases in production or only decreases in the amount collected per capita. Forty-nine people responded to our questions about changes, and 39 also responded to questions about causes.</p>
