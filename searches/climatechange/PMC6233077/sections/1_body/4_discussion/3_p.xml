<p class="p">LEK of environmental factors referred most frequently to the effects of winter precipitation on caterpillar fungus yields. The apparent discrepancy between the regression result that caterpillar fungus production is higher in areas that receive less winter precipitation, and the LEK result that production is higher in years with more winter precipitation (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>) may reflect their different scales of analysis (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). While the regressions elucidate a cross-regional pattern of production level based on average environmental conditions—indicating that drier, colder, and higher-elevation habitats are generally more productive—LEK primarily reflects local-scale, temporal patterns of how interannual variations in winter weather affect relative production amounts within a specific location. Significant winter drying trends in Nepal and Bhutan are therefore unlikely to have created a wholesale shift toward more productive habitats, but they may be shifting the timing of snowmelt and reducing moisture availability needed to promote fungal fruiting (
