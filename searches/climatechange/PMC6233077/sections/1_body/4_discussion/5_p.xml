<p class="p">Our results also identify a universal upper constraint on caterpillar fungus habitat that aligns closely with a single landscape characteristic—presence of permafrost—which appears to influence the distribution of the species. A previous suggestion of its distribution around a climatically defined potential treeline is also temperature-based (
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>). However, our finding of its balancing act between preferring higher elevations and winter temperatures well below 0 °C, and its need to avoid areas likely to have permafrost, suggest the likely importance of key microclimatic controls, such as seasonal timing of soil thaw, temperature, and moisture availability.
