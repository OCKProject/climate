<p class="p">Winter temperature emerged as a key control on caterpillar fungus, limiting not only its distribution, as reported previously in Nepal (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>), but also its production level. The species distribution models detected upper and lower winter temperature thresholds beyond which they predicted little suitable habitat. Within this temperature range, the logistic regressions found that production levels decrease as winter temperatures increase. Significant winter warming to date throughout habitat areas in India, Nepal, and especially Bhutan is therefore likely to have caused production declines in those countries, possibly pushing some areas beyond the viable temperature range. This interpretation is further supported by genetic evidence that natural selection on the fungus toward higher elevations and concomitant adaptations for cold tolerance have resulted in a loss of ability to cope with more heterogeneous environments (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>), thus potentially lowering its fitness under warmer temperatures. In contrast, significant winter warming in the exceptionally cold northeastern Tibetan Plateau may have shifted new areas above the low-temperature threshold, thereby promoting the increased production observed there. In several instances, LEK explicitly linked climate warming to decreasing caterpillar fungus production (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). However, causally linking gradual temperature changes to the complex caterpillar fungus life cycle may be beyond the scope of most collectorsâ€™ LEK, thus underscoring the complementary role of Western science in identifying additional causes of the population trends that collectors observe (

 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>).
