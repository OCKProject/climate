<p class="p">LEK of production trends may be affected by various sources of perception bias. Two of the trends most pertinent to the caterpillar fungus system are shifting baselines (through which knowledge of past conditions is lost, thereby masking evidence of longer-term trends) and interference among harvesters (through which increased competition exaggerates perceptions of population declines) (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). We mitigated the influence of the former by integrating LEK collected at different points in time, and the latter by distinguishing per capita decreases in collection from declining production wherever possible. Our interviewees primarily referred to their harvesting rate, or “catch per unit effort,” as a reliable indicator of overall caterpillar fungus population trends (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). They were attuned to the growing number of collectors vying to find it and took this into account when ascribing caterpillar fungus’ decreasing availability either to true declines in production or to fewer pieces per capita due to higher competition. The shift toward attributing decreasing harvest amounts to overexploitation rather than merely to competition reveals the growing perception among collectors that their harvest rates are now negatively affecting production of the fungus.
