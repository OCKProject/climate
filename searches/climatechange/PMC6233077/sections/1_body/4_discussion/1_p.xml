<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Our multiple evidence base approach using data spanning nearly two decades and four countries revealed that caterpillar fungus production is declining throughout much of its range. While collectors increasingly attribute the decline in caterpillar fungus to overharvesting, habitat and production modeling suggest that climate change is also likely playing a role. Fewer collectors attributed population declines to climate change or habitat degradation. However, climate change may be amplifying the negative effects of harvesting and playing a role in the ecosystem degradation observed by some collectors, thus interacting with collection pressure to affect the status of this resource (

Collectors’ reports of fluctuating production among years, which they linked to interannual variations in weather, are also consistent with the oscillating production predicted by a theoretical host–pathogen model of caterpillar fungus population dynamics (

That data-free, mathematical model indicates that sustainable harvesting of caterpillar fungus should be possible, but that constant, high collection pressure could reduce the system’s ability to recover from perturbations, reduce yields, and eventually drive the fungus to extinction (

Our finding of a temporal shift from a larger proportion of collectors reporting production fluctuations toward a larger proportion reporting a persistent decline in production lends empirical support for these theory-based model predictions (
