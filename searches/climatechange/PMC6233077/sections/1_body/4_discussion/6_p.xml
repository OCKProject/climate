<p class="p">Although the spatial resolution of our models cannot fully capture the microclimates inhabited by the fungi and their caterpillar hosts, these organisms are nonetheless likely to be affected by the substantial climatic and cryospheric changes occurring in this region. Since the 1980s, the number of days with frozen soil on the Tibetan Plateau decreased by 15–22 d per decade within caterpillar fungus’ elevation range (
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>), the permafrost limit has moved upward in elevation by 25–100 m (
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>), and the number of frost days is projected to continue decreasing throughout the Himalayan region as it continues to warm (
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>). Climate warming can also cause more oscillations above and below freezing, which is damaging even for freeze-tolerant species (
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>). An increase in the frequency of freeze–thaw cycling or a shift in the timing of soil thaw with climate warming could thus reduce caterpillar fungus fitness and potentially begin to introduce phenological mismatches between the timing of caterpillar, fungus, and vegetation activity (
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>). In theory, caterpillar fungus should be able to shift its range upward in response to changing climate (
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>), but it is unknown whether all of the necessary elements of the ecosystem—including edaphic conditions, vegetation, caterpillar species, and the fungus itself—will respond in the same ways and at the same pace to climate change, nor how these climate responses may interact with habitat degradation or other factors (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>). Evidence that vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau did not shift upward in response to climate warming from 2000 to 2014 (
 <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>) suggests that a lag in creation of a new suitable habitat may prohibit caterpillar fungus from simply “moving up the mountain” as climatic conditions change.
