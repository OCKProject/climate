<p class="p">The activities of biocrusts were reactivated three days before experiments. Samples in 5 cm-diameter lids were rehydrated with sterile distilled water and then put into a microclimate with a light intensity of 100 μmol m

The whole simulated experiments were completed within 3 months. During the experiments, SW and equivalent NRW in mm were separately added to biocrusts. The NRW amount was based on the actual values measured in the field in autumn, and it was added uniformly to the surface of biocrusts with a small atomizer. Next, the CO
