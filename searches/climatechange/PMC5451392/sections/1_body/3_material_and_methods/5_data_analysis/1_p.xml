<p class="p">Variances of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange rate response to the combinations of different temperature and light intensity were analyzed by one-way ANOVA at the 95% confidence degree. The relationships between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange rate and temperature and light intensity were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. All above analyses were performed by using SPSS 18.0 software. The influences of light intensity, temperature and real-time NRW amount on the carbon exchange rate of biocrusts were analyzed using structural equation models. Data modeling was conducted on Amos 17.0 software.
