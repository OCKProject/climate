<p class="p">Mesocosm experiments were conducted in the Field Experiment Station of the Hobq Desert (40°21′N, 109°51′E) in September, 2014 and 2015. Newly collected samples were placed in open areas between sand dunes as soon as possible after harvesting, more than 2 m away from vascular plants. The bottoms of biocrust samples were adjoined the sands below and the upper surfaces of biocrusts were in the same horizontal plane with soil surface, just like under natural conditions. Each sample area was big enough to ensure real thermal conditions and temperature changes between night and day. Care was taken to maintain the natural thickness and completeness of samples during collection, transportation, and placement. The measurement interval was 1 h from 18:00 to 5:00 a.m., and was 0.5 h after that. At least 30 replicates were set up for each type of biocrust samples. Properties of biocrusts including thickness, coverage, roughness, and other feature, were kept as consistent as possible. All samples were measured at different time points until carbon exchange was no longer detected after sunrise. Samples were also set to monitor the real-time NRW amount at different time points. Microclimate parameters (including temperature, light intensity, and air relative humidity) were synchronously recorded by climate observatory and light meter.</p>
