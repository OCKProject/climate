<p class="p">The ACs and MC used in our experiments were sampled from our Field Experiment Station (Hobq Desert, 40°21′N, 109°51′E). As a transitional zone of plateau desert and desert steppe, the region is a typical continental monsoon climate with an average elevation of 1040 m and an annual mean temperature of 6.1 °C (the lowest is −34.5 °C and the highest is 40.2 °C). The annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively is 293 mm and 2400 mm. The average wind velocity is 3.3 m s
