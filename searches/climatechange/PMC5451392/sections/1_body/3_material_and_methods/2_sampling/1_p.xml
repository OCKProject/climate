 </sup>. Biocrusts were sampled with a 5 cm-diameter metal ring sampler and transferred to 15 cm-diameter petri dishes at Dalate Site and Shapotou Site in September of 2014 and 2015, after no rainfall events for at least three days. Sampling positions were in open areas at least 0.2 m far away from shrubs and coverage of the same biocrusts type was determined to be basically the same. Biocrusts samples were transported to the laboratory as soon as possible to prepare for experiments. Natural thickness and completeness of biocrusts samples were ensured throughout the process of collection and transportation. The characteristics of the five types of biocrusts are shown in Table
