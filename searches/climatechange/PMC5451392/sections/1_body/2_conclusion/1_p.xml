<p class="p">The effect of temperature on biocrust carbon exchange was regulated by water content and light intensity together. Non-rainfall water and light intensity should be considered in the future associated study, and the carbon input in cloudy days after rainfall, at dusk and dawn all should be counted. Additionally, warming under NRW did increase more coverage of cyanobacteria crusts than lichen crusts and moss crusts. But the increased degrees for light-colored (

 <italic class="italic">Scytonema</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Nostoc</italic>) were distinguishing, the responses of cyanolichen crusts and chlorolichen crusts were even quite different. So the coverage of biocrusts could be applicable for monitoring early alterations caused by climatic changes. And it is greatly urgent to accurately determine biocrust types and community composition, particularly to differentiate the types of lichen crusts and dark-colored cyanobacteria crusts. The comparison of different biocrust types in the same successional stage also should be more accurate. That is, other than the aforementioned NRW and light intensity, the transitional states between ACs, and lichen crusts with obvious carbon-fixation differences all should be fully considered in the future study about biocrusts responding to climate change.
