<p class="p">NRW accumulation occurs in the period from nightfall to early morning, with variable temperature, light intensity and NRW amount, and this is an ideal natural opportunity to study the interactions between biocrusts carbon exchange and water, temperature and light. Therefore in this study, we selected 4 types of biocrusts that are highly dominated by variant cryptogams and possess different carbon assimilation mechanisms, namely 2 cyanobacteria crusts (AC1 and AC2), 1 lichen crust with cyanobacteria as photobiont (LC1), the other with green algae as photobiont (LC2) and 1 moss crust (MC). In order to obtain intrinsic potentiality and adaptation patterns of biocrustal carbon exchange responding to temperature, light and water, various light intensities and temperature conditions that were similar to the nights with abundant NRW, as well as two moisture gradients of saturated water (SW) and equivalent NRW (E-NRW) were firstly designed. The respiration rate (R), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), gross photosynthesis (Pg), and light compensation points (LCPs) of different biocrusts were measured, and the pattern of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange were synchronously analyzed by multivariate nonlinear regression. The ratios of respiration to gross photosynthesis (R/Pg), which could reflect the biological differences of various biocrust types utilizing water, were also explored. Then, by 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> mesocosm experiments, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchanges of all chosen biocrusts were analyzed in NRW abundant seasons, the crucial factors and the patterns of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange were determined by structural equation models, and the influencing degrees were quantifiably perceived by path coefficients. Finally, the community changes of biocrusts under the background of global climate change were predicted, and the suggestions for subsequent relative studies were proposed.
