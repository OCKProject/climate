<p class="p">Light, as the necessary condition for the carbon fixation of cryptogams, is the driving energy of the earthâ€™s temperature change. Either seasonal or diurnal carbon exchange at global scale influenced by temperature is actually driven by solar irradiation. Since photosynthesis of most plants mainly occurs in daytime with abundant sunlight, previous studies paid more attention to the effects of temperature and water rather than light
