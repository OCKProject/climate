 </sup> values of various biocrusts were at the 0.20~0.30. Variations of surface temperature (Ts), air temperature (Ta), and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange (CE) were all directly driven by light intensity, and the driving force for Ts was the strongest, followed by Ta, for CE was the weakest. Ts had the strongest effect on NRW in two ACs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,b</xref>). However, in LC2 and MC, light intensity directly affected NRW and also indirectly affected NRW via Ta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c,d</xref>). Therefore, CE was influenced by light intensity, Ta, Ts, and NRW together. For the CE of ACs, influence of Ta was the strongest, followed by Ts, then NRW, and that of light intensity was the minimum. For the CE of LC2 and MC, Ta and NRW both had strongest effect, followed by Ts, influence of light intensity was the weakest, but still higher than that of ACs.
