<p class="p">R of all biocrusts under E-NRW also increased with temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), the sequence from high to low was MC &gt; LC2 &gt; LC1 &gt; AC2 &gt; AC1. For Pn and LCPs, both increased with temperature, but Pn (except LC1 was never detected) had no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) between temperature gradient of 2.5 °C. At the same temperature, LCP in AC1 was lowest, in turn followed by AC2, LC2 and MC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Under light intensity lower than LCPs, the time window of positive Pn and the increasing amplitude with decreasing temperature manifested in the order: AC1 &gt; AC2 &gt; LC2 (LC2 slightly above MC). But the order reversed under higher light intensity, the increasing amplitude with rising temperature was in the order of AC1 &gt; AC2 &gt; LC2 ≈ MC. The pattern of Pg was similar to that of SW except for LC1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), Pg also increased with light intensity and temperature, and the increasing amplitude was also highest in ACs, and then in turn was LCs and MC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). The magnitude under the same temperature and light intensity from highest to the lowest was MC, LC2, AC2, and AC1. When light intensities were higher than 25 μmol m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the warming of 2.5 °C in ACs also resulted in quite different Pg.
