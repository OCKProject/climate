<p class="p">Temperature also significantly influences Pn and Pg, and generally Pn and Pg all increases with temperature below their optimum. However, respiration intensity often also increases with temperature when moisture is abundant

 </sup>. To offset and exceed increased respiration consumption, biocrusts must produce higher Pg under the rising temperature. The questions are that the preference temperatures of assimilation and catabolism are not always the same. The increased temperature and decreased moisture all increase respiration, while carbon sequestration increase only when temperature reduction and rainfall enhancement
