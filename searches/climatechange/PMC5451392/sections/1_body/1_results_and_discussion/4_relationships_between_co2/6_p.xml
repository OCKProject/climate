 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> light and E-NRW, carbon exchange was positively related with temperature, just like light-colored crusts from cool desert. So biocrust carbon input under NRW is always positively correlated with light, while the effect of temperature depends upon both the range of water content and light intensity. Namely, when water is limited and light is relative abundant, the effect of temperature is positive; but when water is enough, it is negative, regardless of light intensity. So it is difficult to judge the effect of temperature on carbon flux just by dark-colored crusts or light-colored crusts
