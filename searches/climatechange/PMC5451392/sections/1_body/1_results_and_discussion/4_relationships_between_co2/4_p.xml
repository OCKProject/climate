<p class="p">Other than genetic factors, the light intensity is very important to photosynthetic efficiency. Although AC2 also had carbon-fixation advantage under weak light, it had higher Pn and Pg than AC1 under higher light intensity. LC and MC also required a higher light intensity to release their higher photosynthetic productive potential. But compared to the daytime after raining, biocrusts under NRW were actually in a condition with limited light. Thus Pn and Pg of all biocrusts significantly positively correlated with light intensity, and light intensity explained 82~94% variances of carbon exchange under light lower than 10 μmol m
