<p class="p">Regression models also showed that 54~81% variances of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange were explained by temperature and light intensity under SW. Light intensity accounted for 52~79% variance of Pn and 49~80% variance of Pg. In general, the models had more predictive power for Pg than for Pn. For CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange under E-NRW, temperature and light intensity accounted for 79~96% of the total variance, and 82~94% of the variances were explained by light intensity at low light (≤10 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). At higher light intensity (≥25 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), temperature accounted for 48~84% variance of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange in the two ACs; but its explanatory powers for the other three types of biocrusts were lower, although the explanations for Pg (14~70%) were still significant (&lt;0.0001).
