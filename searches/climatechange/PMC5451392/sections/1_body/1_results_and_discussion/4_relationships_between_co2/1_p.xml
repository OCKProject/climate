<p class="p">Based on multivariate nonlinear regression analysis (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), temperature, water content were both significant predictors of R (accounted for 83~98% of the total variance). R was positively related to temperature and water content, but the disparities of the explanatory degrees obviously existed among different biocrusts. For instance, 78% variances of R in AC1 was explained by water content, and temperature accounted for more variance (59%) of R in AC2. The predictive power of water content and temperature approached for two LCs, and 69% variance of R in MC was explained by temperature.
