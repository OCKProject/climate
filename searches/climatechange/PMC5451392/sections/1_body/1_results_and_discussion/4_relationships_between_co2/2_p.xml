<p class="p">Under the two water conditions and the light intensity ranges, Pn and Pg were both positively related to light intensity. Under all combinations of experimental light intensity and SW, light intensity had more influence on Pn than temperature, and Pn was always negatively related to temperature. However, for Pn under equivalent NRW, light intensity had more predictive power than temperature only under light intensity less than 10 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and Pn was negatively related to temperature. But the predictive power of temperature was stronger than light intensity that was equal to or more than 25 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, so Pn was positively related to temperature at this condition.
