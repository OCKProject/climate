<p class="p">Although the direct effects of light intensity and temperature on carbon exchange of biocrusts are distinct under different moisture conditions, diurnal and seasonal carbon exchanges are fundamentally driven by solar irradiation. With the aggravation of global warming, more solar shortwave radiation pass through the atmosphere and arrive at the earth, which result in more aggravated changes in air temperature and soil surface temperature, and will further affect the responses of biocrusts to climate parameters. Based on the importance of soil moisture to climate change

 </sup>, together with the negative correlationship between Pn and temperature under nocturnal weak light, we found that warming facilitated the cover of ACs more than that of LC2 and MC; AC2 more than AC1; and LC2 more than MC, and the decreased NRW amount caused by climate change would decrease the cover of LC2 and MC more than ACs. Whereas the coverage of ACs increased more or decreased less than that of lichens and mosses meant that the cover of LC2 and MC would decline on the whole pattern, and this is similar to most of the existing results
