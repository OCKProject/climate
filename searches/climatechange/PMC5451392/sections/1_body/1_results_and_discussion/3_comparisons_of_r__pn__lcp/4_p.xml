<p class="p">Fourthly, LCPs were significantly influenced by the water condition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>), under E-NRW the LCPs decreased and the values were lower than that of SW, except for AC1 at equal or lower than 2.5 °C. And the larger decreasing amplitude occurred at 7.5~10 °C. Under light condition, the CO

 </sup>, light intensity is the primary factor in the carbon balance between assimilation and dissimilation. The suitable conditions of assimilation and dissimilation are usually not synchronous, but adaptable plants just need low environmental conditions (low temperature, weak light and low water condition included) to activate assimilation

 </sup>. Our experiments showed that under either SW or E-NRW conditions, the light intensity that AC1 required to activate positive Pn was the lowest, followed by AC2 and LC1, and LC2 and MC needed the highest. This was mainly due to their genetic characteristics of dominant cryptogams. The photosynthetic organisms in the two ACs and LC1 are all cyanobacteria, containing abundant amounts of chlorophyll a and phycobilin, allowing them to capture low light that cannot be utilized by other plants. Cyanobacteria also possess CO
