<p class="p">Thirdly, Pn under E-NRW was lower than that under SW for the same temperature and light intensity. We know that the carbon sequestration capacities of different stages of biocrusts are significantly different, and that of MC is the highest, followed in turn by LC and AC; or later stages are higher than earlier stages, light-colored biocrusts are lower than dark-colored ones

 </sup>. We also confirmed these patterns both in Pn and Pg. But we thought this did not only depend on biomass of cryptogams, but also on their genetic characteristics. The RuBisCO activities of cyanobacteria are remarkable lower than that of green algae and mosses. Although the two ACs are both dominated by cyanobacteria, AC2 had a higher carbon fixation rate than AC1 under stronger light, because the abundant
