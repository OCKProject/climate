 </sup>. Based on our data, the different responses were mainly determined by their community traits because the low R/Pg meant approaching carbon balance. During NRW accumulation period, AC1 had strongest competitive advantage due to lowest R/Pg under weak light of all temperatures (highest Pn and lowest R). AC2 had advantage because its R/Pg at −2.5~0 °C was second only to that of AC1. Though LC2 could utilize vaporous water to activate photosynthesis and had relatively high assimilation efficiency

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>, its R/Pg at −2.5~5 °C was lower than that of MC. So its competition power just followed ACs. MC well adapt to water-deficit environments due to effectively allocation water
