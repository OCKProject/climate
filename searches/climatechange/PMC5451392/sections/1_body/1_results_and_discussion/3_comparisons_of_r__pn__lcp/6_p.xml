<p class="p">Finally, the amplitude of R increasing with increased temperature under E-NRW was lower than that under SW. Dark respiration is an oxidation-reduction process in which soil communities absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide in darkness. In biocrusts, it generally increases rapidly with the rising temperature
