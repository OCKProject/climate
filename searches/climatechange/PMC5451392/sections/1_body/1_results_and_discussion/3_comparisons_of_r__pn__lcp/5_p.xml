 </sup>. We found that LCPs under SW and E-NRW behaved very differently. The LCPs under E-NRW almost were all lower than that under SW in all experimental temperatures. The decreasing amplitude in the higher temperature range (5 °C~10 °C) was larger than that under temperature lower than 5 °C. This showed biocrusts could regulate LCPs to gain a maximum photosynthetic carbon fixation rate according to the water conditions. Additionally, biocrusts with lower LCPs were more competitive in utilization NRW. And free cyanobacteria possessed stronger CCM than other autotrophs under high water content
