<p class="p">R of all biocrusts increased as temperature increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), but at the same temperature, the order from high to low was: MC &gt; LC2 &gt; LC1 &gt; AC2 &gt; AC1. Pn obviously increased with light intensity, but decreased with rising temperature for the same biocrusts, though no significant difference over different temperatures. LCPs also varied with temperature, specifically, the lower the temperature, the lower the LCP. At the same temperature, the LCP of AC1 was the lowest, and in turn followed by AC2, LC1, LC2, and MC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). The pattern of Pg was similar to Pn, namely increased with light intensity and temperature, but the increasing amount was highest in ACs, followed by LCs, and MC was the lowest. At the same temperature and light intensity, the maximum Pg was in the order: MC &gt; LC2 &gt; LC1 &gt; AC2 &gt; AC1. And the difference of 2.5 °C in ACs resulted in quite different Pg.
