<p class="p">This paper will argue that the key elements of cropping system adaptation to climate change are:

   <label class="label">(i)</label>
   <p class="p">Access to elite germplasm from other regions that currently experience conditions likely to occur in the target region as a result of climate change;</p>

   <p class="p">Evaluation of potential new cultivars under the full range of climate conditions they are likely to encounter over their commercial life;</p>

   <p class="p">Seed systems that deliver new varieties to farmers quickly, and then just as quickly replace them, keeping pace with the changing climate.</p>
