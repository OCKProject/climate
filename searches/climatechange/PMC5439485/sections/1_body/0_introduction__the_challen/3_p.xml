<p class="p">Concerns about such effects have prompted widespread efforts to identify major genes affecting drought, flooding, and heat tolerance. Some alleles with large effects on these traits have been identified ((e.g., in rice,

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ye et al., 2015</xref>), but they are relatively rare, and will likely provide only a small portion of the genetic variability needed for adaptation. Adaptation will be achieved by: matching phenology to growing season length through changes in cultivar day-length and temperature response (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mickelbart et al., 2015</xref>). The genetic architecture of these traits tends to be highly polygenic. Even control of flowering time has been shown to be influenced by many genes with small effects (e.g.
