<p class="p">Slow varietal turnover in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is likely to result in large part from lack of information about and access to new varieties on the part of smallholder farmers. It may also result from failure of new varieties to match old ones in key quality or other characteristics even when they exceed them in yield potential, disease resistance, or stress tolerance. However, there are many cases of rapid adoption of new varieties in smallholder agriculture when new varieties offer clear and significant advantages over currently-used varieties, and when farmers have access to seed.</p>
