 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brennan and Byerlee (1991)</xref> proposed the 
 <italic class="italic">average area-weighted age of varieties in farmers’ fields</italic> as a measure of the rate of varietal replacement on-farm. Reliable estimates of this important parameter are rare; a few are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In many regions, farmers continue to grow varieties that were developed early in the Green Revolution; this slow rate of varietal turnover is likely contributing to the yield stagnation reported in many parts of the world by 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ray et al. (2012)</xref>. To take just a few examples, over 25% of the South Asian wet-season rice area is still planted to the variety Swarna, which was released about 35 years ago (IRRI, unpublished data). In India, the average age of wheat varieties in farmers' fields increased from 9 years in 1997-8 to 13 in 2007-8 (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krishna et al., 2014</xref>). Because the time it takes to develop and release a wheat variety via pedigree breeding in India is 10–15 years, this means most Indian farmers are using varieties selected over 20 years ago. 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smale et al. (2008)</xref> showed that slow varietal replacement was retarding wheat productivity growth in Punjab, India. The situation is similar throughout the developing world; hundreds of millions of farmers are growing landraces or older improved varieties that are not optimized for today's climate or production systems. By growing older varieties, farmers are also missing out on the benefits of many years of genetic gains from the breeding programs that serve them, but that are insufficiently linked to them as a result of dysfunctional varietal release and seed systems.
