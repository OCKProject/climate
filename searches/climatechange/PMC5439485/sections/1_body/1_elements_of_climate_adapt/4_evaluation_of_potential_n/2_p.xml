<p class="p">Year-to-year and location-to-location variation in the amount and timing of rainfall, as well as in the occurrence and severity of extreme temperature events, is substantial in many crop-producing regions, and may be increasing as a result of climate change (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stratonovitch and Semenov, 2015</xref>). The annual weather variability at any particular location can be greater than the variation in long-term average temperature or rainfall at individual locations within a breeding program's target region. Therefore, although crop cultivars are bred in and for specific regions, they need to be adapted to weather variability within those regions, both within and across years. Cultivars developed by multinational seed companies and international crop research centers are evaluated across many locations and several years during development to ensure that they are exposed to a representative sample of the TPE they will encounter in farmersâ€™ fields (

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gaffney et al., 2015</xref>). As a result of this extensive evaluation, they exhibit very broad adaptation to the range of environmental and management conditions that occur within the TPE. This can translate into adaptation even to regions where the cultivar was not originally tested, because similar production environments can occur across regions and even continents. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kebede et al. (2013)</xref> have shown that maize variety trials conducted in subtropical areas of Mexico and southern Africa yield highly correlated results. The similarity of production environments across vast regions has led to the selection of varieties exhibiting very broad adaptation to a range of climatic conditions. For example, the maize inbred line CML312 has contributed to hybrids grown throughout Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Early Green Revolution wheat and rice varieties were grown on millions of hectares in North Africa and South Asia (

This breadth of adaptation, achieved via testing of breeding materials in a very extensive sampling of the TPE during selection, resulted in increased tolerance to a range of naturally-occurring stresses. In the US Corn Belt, wide-area testing was shown to have increased tolerance to stresses such as drought, low fertility, and cold (
