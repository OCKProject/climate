<p class="p">Although climate change is occurring rapidly, it is still relatively gradual in historical terms. The best predictor of the climate in the very near future, (i.e. the next ten years) is the current climate. Farmers who are at least risk with respect to climate change are those who use varieties bred very recently. The most important climate change adaptation tools for crop production are thus breeding and cultivar delivery systems that rapidly and continuously develop new varieties and replace old ones. Farmers working in cropping systems served by highly competitive commercial seed industries, e.g. maize and soybean producers in the US Corn Belt, are served by such systems. Most farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are not; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al. (2016)</xref> noted that the time to develop and deliver maize varieties in sub-Saharan Africa is currently around 30 years, a period in which substantial climate change has occurred. Farmers in much of the developing world are using varieties selected in a rather different climate.
