<p class="p">How, then, can breeders of the staple crops in the developing world acquire the elite germplasm needed to rapidly adapt to a changing climate? Multinational seed companies, which focus on highly commercialized crops like maize and soy, often have operations or alliances in different countries, and can move their elite proprietary germplasm among these countries. On the other hand, small national programs and regional seed companies usually lack the international connections needed to cope with a rapidly changing climate, and sharing of germplasm between national programs in different countries is limited and difficult. Of more direct use are the new elite materials continually being generated by CGIAR breeding programs, which focus strongly on developing commercial varieties with improved heat, flooding, and drought tolerance that are freely available to, and widely used by, national programs and seed companies (eg 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cairns et al., 2013b</xref>). The preservation and expansion of the CGIAR's global breeding networks is critical to the developing world's capacity to adapt to climate change. These networks, which often test varieties in a broad range of environments and regions, generating materials with a broad range of adaptation, are often the only accessible sources of elite germplasm from other countries for small breeding programs. They are critical to climate change adaptation in the developing world.
