<p class="p">What of the plant genetic resources collections of national agricultural systems and the international crop research institutes of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)? CGIAR gene banks, as well as those of the USDA, still freely provide breeding programs with access to the great diversity in their collections (

However, these collections consist mainly of unimproved landraces, which are important sources of alleles for stress tolerance and disease resistance but are usually narrowly adapted to their environment of origin, and are unsuitable for modern commercial agriculture because they lack the fertilizer responsiveness and yield potential farmers need now. Most breeding programs cannot afford to use unimproved gene bank accessions directly as parents in breeding for greater heat and drought tolerance, due to the yield penalty usually associated with them. Although inexpensive molecular marker systems are reducing the cost of localizing and exploiting genes for stress tolerance in unimproved materials, breeders still have great need of elite, commercially-acceptable materials from regions already experiencing the expected climate. Elite varieties from warmer, drier, or wetter regions are the critical building materials needed to construct varieties adapted to the future climate in their own target regions. Some public germplasm collections also acquire and maintain older elite improved varieties, but the vast majority of their improved holdings were developed over 30 years ago, in a different climate and under different agricultural conditions.
