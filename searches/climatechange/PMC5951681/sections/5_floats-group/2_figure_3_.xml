   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) The spatial distribution of predicted genomic variation based on projecting the GDM model onto geography and current environmental conditions. Regions with similar colors are predicted to have similar genomic compositions. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) The predicted genomic vulnerability based on comparing the GDM model projected onto current environmental conditions with the GDM model projected onto predicted environmental conditions for 2070. The higher the difference (darker red), the more genomic change required to track climate between current and future conditions. Black points are sampling sites.
