   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) A map of the geographic locations of the 36 sampling sites in southeastern Australia. Sampling locations are indicated with dots color coded in a rainbow gradient based on latitude. Black asterisks indicate the six sites also used for growth chamber experiments. The gray background shading indicates the species distribution polygon. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Principal coordinate analysis of the genomic distance between individual samples. Samples are color coded by site to match the map. The percentage on each axis indicates how much of the genomic variation between individuals was explained by the axis. Note that PCoA axes 1 and 2 are switched from standard for easier visualization of the latitudinal gradient. The inset shows the regression of PCoA axis 1 against latitude.

    <p class="p">Dendrogram based on genomic distance between samples showing the strong clustering of technical replicates (denoted with an ‘R’ after the sample name and highlighted in yellow). Note that three of the technical replicates failed to pass quality control and are not included in the dendrogram. Additional sample pairs show strong clustering. In each of these cases, the individuals of the pair are from the same sampling site, indicating samples that are closely related.</p>
