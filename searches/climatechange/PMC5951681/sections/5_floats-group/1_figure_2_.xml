   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Non-linear relationship between environmental distance and genomic distance. Points are site pairs; the line is the predicted relationship. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Relationship between predicted genomic distance and observed genomic distance. Points are site pairs; the line indicates where observation and prediction match. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) The geographic spline showing little predicted genomic change between sites less than 500 km apart and increasing genomic variation as geographic distance increases beyond 500 km. Points are site pairs. (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) Geographic splines from 100 iterations of sampling 70% of sites. Each grey line is an iteration; the black line is the full model prediction. (
   <bold class="bold">E–H</bold>) Predicted splines showing the estimated relationship between genomic distance and the environmental variable: (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) total nitrogen content at 100–200 cm of soil depth, (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) mean temperature of the coldest quarter, (
   <bold class="bold">G</bold>) precipitation of the wettest quarter, and (
   <bold class="bold">H</bold>) isothermality.
