<p class="p">As a result, we included four environmental variables in the final model: isothermality (bioclimatic variable 3), mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bioclimatic variable 11), precipitation of the wettest quarter (bioclimatic variable 16), and total soil nitrogen at 100–200 cm (nitrogen at depth) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>). To quantify the predictive power of the GDM model, we used a cross validation approach by generating 1000 models with a random 30% of sampling sites removed. GDM proved satisfactory at predicting genomic differences between removed sites (cross validation correlation mean = 0.73, standard deviation = 0.12).
