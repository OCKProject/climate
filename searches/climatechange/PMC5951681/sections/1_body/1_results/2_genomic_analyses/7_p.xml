<p class="p">To project the final GDM model onto the current environmental landscape, we first delineated the geographic extent of the analysis by defining an 
 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> distribution polygon. We then projected the GDM model onto this region based on the current values of the environmental variables across the landscape. For visualization, the dimensionality was reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) and the first three axes were assigned to RGB colors to represent genomic composition, with similar color for similar predicted genomic composition. The resulting map partitioned the landscape into a number of regions with different predicted genomic compositions, including northern coastal, northern inland, and southern regions (
