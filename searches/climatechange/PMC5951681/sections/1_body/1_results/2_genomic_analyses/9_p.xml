<p class="p">We also used the GDM model to compare the genomic composition under future environmental conditions at a single location to the genomic composition under current climate conditions across the landscape. This comparison is useful for identifying optimal seed sources for restoration sites given climate change scenarios. We demonstrated this utility by selecting two hypothetical reforestation sites and identifying distinct regions that would provide favorable seed sources for each site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The analysis for the southern reforestation site identified a large portion of the southern distribution, centered at the reforestation site. For this site it appears that the selected areas are largely a result of the pattern of isolation by distance, in particular the lack of genetic differentiation for long geographical distances. The analysis for the northern reforestation site identified a more limited range of areas across the landscape, although this could be driven in part by a decreased power due to lower sampling intensity in the north. Within 500 km of the site, the analysis identified a core region centered on the reforestation site and small regions along the northern coast. There were a number of areas within 500 km of the site that were not good matches. In addition, a number of more distant areas along the southern coast were also identified, indicating these selected areas are driven more by patterns of isolation by environment than isolation by distance. Overall, the map suggests that there is a lower availability of seed sources to match the northern reforestation site.
