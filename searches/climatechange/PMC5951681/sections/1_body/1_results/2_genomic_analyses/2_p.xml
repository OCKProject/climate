<p class="p">The PCoA of genomic distance among samples showed continuous variation with little suggestion of discrete population structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1B</xref>). This analysis, which was based on genomic data with no geographic information included, showed that the samples largely formed a single cluster, with the first PCoA axis correlating with latitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1B</xref>). Outside of the main cluster, samples from the northernmost site separated out along the first PCoA axis (vertical axis) and a few samples from two other sites separated out along the second PCoA axis (horizontal axis). Together, the first two PCoA axes explained 3.0% of the genomic variation among individuals. The Mantel test, examining the correlation between geographic and genetic distance matrices, estimated that geographic distance between samples explained 2.3% of the variation in individual genomic distance, indicating weak, but statistically significant, isolation by distance (p=0.0001). We summarized genomic diversity between sampling sites using pairwise F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>. For all comparisons F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> was low (mean F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> = 0.04, sd = 0.02) (

 <sub class="sub">st</sub> of 0.10 occurs between sites 3 and 13, which are separated by over 1200 km. Similar to the individual-level PCoA of genomic distance among samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1B</xref>), the site-level PCoA of F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> between sampling sites also corresponded roughly to latitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4" class="xref">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, the first two axes of the PCoA of F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> between sampling sites explained a higher percentage of variation (37.1%). All sites with more than four individuals genotyped had similar levels of allelic diversity and expected heterozygosity (
