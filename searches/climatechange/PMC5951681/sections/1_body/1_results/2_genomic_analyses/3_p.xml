Of the 28 environmental variables considered for the model, we removed 12 variables because the single variable model explained less than 5% of the deviance (bioclimatic variables 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19; elevation; water at depth; Prescott Index; and MrVBF). We removed an additional nine variables due to high correlation and lower explanatory power than another remaining variable (bioclimatic variables 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 15, 18; surface nitrogen; and surface phosphorus) (

We ran permutation testing on a model with the remaining seven variables, along with geographic distance. This highlighted an additional two variables with low statistical significance and low explanatory power. We removed these two variables (surface water and bioclimatic variable 8) from the final model. We also removed phosphorus at depth because, although it explained a substantial amount of genomic variation, the sampled sites were not well distributed across the range of phosphorus values.
