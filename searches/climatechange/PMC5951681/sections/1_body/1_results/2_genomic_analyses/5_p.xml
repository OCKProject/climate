<p class="p">Geographic distance showed a non-linear relationship with genomic distance. The geographic spline predicted no genomic differentiation until close to 500 km, at which point an increase in geographic distance predicted an increase in genomic distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>). Randomly subsampling sites showed that the predicted genomic distance for large geographic distances was quite variable, but for sites less than 500 km apart, all iterations consistently predicted little genomic differentiation between sites (
