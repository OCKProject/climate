<p class="p">We conducted a climate controlled growth experiment to examine phenotypic variation among sampling sites and assay phenotypic plasticity. We grew seedlings from six sites, with six maternal lines per site, at two different climate regimes (average summer conditions and 5Â°C hotter than summer conditions). We measured variation in three seedling growth traits: seedling height, total leaf length, and relative height increment. For analysis of seedling height and total leaf length, we analyzed a total of 291 seedlings (from 32 maternal lines representing six sampling sites) that were determined to be well established at the five week measurement. For analysis of the relative height increment, we analyzed a total of 560 seedlings (from all 36 maternal lines) for which we were able to calculate this metric. There were four seedlings that were outliers for the relative height increment. These outliers had little effect on the results of the linear models, so we included them in the final analysis.</p>
