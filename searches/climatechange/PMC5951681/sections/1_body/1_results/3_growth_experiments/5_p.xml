<p class="p">Both our climate controlled growth experiment and our outdoor drought experiment found high levels of phenotypic variation in all measured traits. While most of the variation remained unexplained, sampling site explained a small, but statistically significant, amount of the variation. We determined whether phenotypic divergence between sites could be due to local selection using a Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>-F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> analysis (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilbert and Whitlock, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leinonen et al., 2013</xref>). We estimated Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> for each trait under each experimental condition and compared these values to the genome-wide distribution of F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8" class="xref">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> were not significantly different, indicating that phenotypic differences between sites could be a result of genetic drift alone. While not statistically significant, seedling height did show differences between Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> in both hot (Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>-F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> = 0.33, p=0.11) and warm (Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>-F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> = 0.24, p=0.14) chambers. This indicates that local selection could be driving the divergence in height between sites, but our analysis lacked statistical power due to small sample sizes.
