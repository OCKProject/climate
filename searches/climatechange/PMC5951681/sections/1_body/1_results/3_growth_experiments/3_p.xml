<p class="p">We then conducted an outdoor drought experiment using a subset of seedlings from the chamber experiment. We analyzed 146 seedlings representing 20 maternal lines from five sampling sites. These seedlings were grouped into 73 pairs, with one of each pair assigned to each treatmentâ€”well-watered versus drought. We analyzed variation in four response variables: stomatal conductance, leaf length to width ratio, relative chlorophyll content (SPAD index), and specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area divided by dry mass).</p>
