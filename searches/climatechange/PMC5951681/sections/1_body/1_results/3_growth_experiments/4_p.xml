<p class="p">The drought-treated seedlings had significantly lower stomatal conductance rates than the well-watered ones, indicating that the seedlings were affected by the watering treatment (p&lt;0.00001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6" class="xref">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Treatment explained most of the variation in stomatal conductance (62.3%), while maternal line and sampling site explained only a small amount of variation (5.8% and 0.9% respectively). For the remaining three response variables (leaf length to width ratio, SPAD, and SLA), much of the variation was unexplained (40.5%–70%). Treatment was not statistically significant and explained little to no variation (0.0–4.4%). Sampling site and maternal line were statistically significant in the linear models at the p=0.05 level and explained some variation (6.7–21.2%) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6" class="xref">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Smaller, thicker leaves, and thus lower SLA values, were expected for drought-treated seedlings and for seedlings grown from seed collected from drier areas. Consistent with this expectation, the seedlings subjected to drought conditions showed lower SLA values. However, seedlings from drier sampling sites (D and T3) showed higher SLA values than more mesic sites (B, G, and 11), contrary to expectation (
