<p class="p">The models for all three response variables showed that all fixed effects (sampling site, maternal line nested within sampling site, and experimental condition) were statistically significant at the p=0.05 level (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4" class="xref">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Experimental condition explained a small percentage of the variation (1.2–8.1%), as did sampling site (1.8–17.7%). Maternal line tended to explain a larger amount of variation (10.6–27.6%). However, most of the variation remained unexplained (56.6–71.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4" class="xref">Supplementary file 4</xref>). None of the three response variables showed significant variation in phenotypic plasticity across sites (p&gt;0.50 for all maternal line/sampling site by experimental condition interactions) (
