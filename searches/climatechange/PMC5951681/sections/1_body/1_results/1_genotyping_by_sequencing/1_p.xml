<p class="p">We selected leaf material from 39 sites, sampling 3–10 trees per site (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elshire et al., 2011</xref>) and used a reference alignment approach to call genotypes. We conducted a preliminary analysis based on 123,227 SNPs and removed 69 samples due to greater than 60% missing data. Visual examination of a cluster dendrogram of genomic distance between samples showed that technical replicates cluster closely together (

After removal of poor quality and geographic and genomic outlier samples, we re-ran the genotyping with the remaining 280 samples, resulting in 9,781 SNPs after filtering. A second preliminary PCoA identified an additional five outlier samples that we considered sufficiently differentiated from the main
