<p class="p">We obtained 
 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> leaf samples from mature trees at 39 sampling sitesâ€”38 sites across the species' native range and a single site in Western Australia, well outside the species' natural distribution. We collected samples through a community science project described in 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Broadhurst et al., 2018</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1" class="xref">Supplementary file 1</xref>). From each site, a citizen scientist collected leaf samples from up to 30 trees, put the samples in silica gel for drying, and shipped them to CSIRO for processing. In addition to leaf material, they also collected seeds from the sampled trees when available.
