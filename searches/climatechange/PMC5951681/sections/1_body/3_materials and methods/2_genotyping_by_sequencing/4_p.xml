<p class="p">We reran GATK's joint genotyping on the final sample set. We again used GATK to remove variants that were indels, SNPs with no variation relative to the reference, and non-biallelic SNPs. We determined final filtering thresholds by examining parameter distributions. A locus was retained for subsequent analysis if ExcessHet &lt; 13.0 (‘phred-scaled p-value for exact test of excess heterozygosity’), -0.3 &lt; InbreedingCoeff &lt; 0.3 (‘likelihood-based test for the inbreeding among samples’), MQ &gt; 15.0 (‘Root Mean Square of the mapping quality of reads across all samples’), -10.0 &lt; MQRankSum &lt; 10.0 (‘Rank Sum Test for mapping qualities of REF versus ALT reads’), and QD &gt; 8.0 (‘variant call confidence normalized by depth of sample reads supporting a variant’). We ran a second preliminary PCoA analysis to identify additional outlier samples. Finally, we used VCFtools (v0.1.12b, [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>]) to remove SNPs with greater than 60% missing data and thin the SNPs so that none were closer than 300 bp.
