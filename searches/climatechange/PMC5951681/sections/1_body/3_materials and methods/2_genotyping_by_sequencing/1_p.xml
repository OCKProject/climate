<p class="p">We selected 3 to 10 trees per sampling site for sequencing and we processed each of the seven trees from Western Australia twice, using different leaves from the same tree to serve as technical replicates. No power analysis was used to determine sample size during the design of the study. Sample size was determined based on our experience and judgment, with consideration of the availability of samples. We sequenced these 379 samples using a modified Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) protocol (

Briefly, we extracted genomic DNA from approximately 50 mg of leaf tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant 96 Kit, digested with PstI for genome complexity reduction, and ligated with a uniquely barcoded sequencing adapter pair. We then individually PCR amplified each sample to avoid sample bias. We pooled samples in equimolar concentrations and extracted library amplicons between 350 and 600 bp from an agarose gel. We sequenced the library pool on an Illumina HiSeq2500 using a 101 bp paired-end protocol at the Biomolecular Resource Facility at the Australian National University, generating almost 260 million read pairs.
