<p class="p">We used GATK's

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>]) for a preliminary round of joint genotyping across all samples based on the individual variant calls and again increasing the heterozygosity (-hets) to 0.005 and the indel heterozygosity (-indelHeterozygosity) to 0.0005. For basic filtering, we used GATK to remove variants that were indels, had no variation relative to the reference, were non-biallelic SNPs, had QD &lt; 2.0 (‘variant call confidence normalized by depth of sample reads supporting a variant’), MQ &gt; 40.0 (‘Root Mean Square of the mapping quality of reads across all samples’), or MQRankSum &lt; -12.5 (‘Rank Sum Test for mapping qualities of REF versus ALT reads’). We removed samples with more than 60% missing data and SNPs with more than 80% missing data. We examined the genomic distance between samples to verify that technical replicates clustered closely together. We used a preliminary PCoA, based on genomic distance between samples, to identify outlier samples. We removed outlier samples and poorly sequenced samples from the dataset for final genotyping and all downstream analyses.
