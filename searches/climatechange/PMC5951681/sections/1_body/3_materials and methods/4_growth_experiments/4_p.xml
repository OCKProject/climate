<p class="p">We investigated phenotypic plasticity by examining interaction plots between maternal line and experimental condition for three response variables: seedling height, total leaf length, and relative height increment. We statistically tested for an interaction between sampling site/maternal line and experimental condition with linear mixed-effect models using

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bates et al., 2015</xref>]) for each of the three response variables. Due to a lack of power to consider maternal line nested within sampling site, we ran two models for each response variable—one with maternal line and one with sampling site. These models included the experimental condition, sampling site or maternal line, and their interactions as fixed effects. We included germination chamber and block as random effects. We visually identified four outliers with a relative height increment over 0.035. We ran the models with and without outliers to determine if they affected the results.
