<p class="p">After completion of the chamber experiment, we conducted an outdoor covered drought experiment on the 16 week old seedlings. No power analysis was used to determine sample size during the design of the experiment. Sample size was determined based on our experience and judgment, with consideration of the availability of space in the covered growth facility. We selected 160 seedlings from five sampling sites, with four maternal lines per site. We paired each seedling with a seedling of similar size from the same maternal line and treatment chamber. We randomly assigned each seedling of the pair to a different treatment group. We transplanted the seedlings to PVC tubes (9 cm diameter x 50 cm height with sand, perlite, and slow release osmocote) and kept them well watered for seven weeks, allowing them to acclimate to the outdoor conditions. Then we imposed two treatments: well-watered and drought. For the well-watered treatment, we watered the seedlings to saturation as needed (between three times per week and twice per day, depending on the weather). For the drought treatment, we watered as necessary to reach (but not exceed) 50% saturation.</p>
