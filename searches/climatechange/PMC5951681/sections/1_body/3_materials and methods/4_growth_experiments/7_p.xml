<p class="p">We measured leaf traits on each seedling three weeks after the initiation of treatment. We measured stomatal conductance with a porometer (SC-1 Leaf Porometer by Decagon Devices) and determined that water stress was induced in the drought-treated seedlings. We determined the leaf length to width ratio from a scan of the most recent fully expanded leaf from each seedling using image analysis software (WD3 WinDIAS Leaf Image Analysis System by Delta-T Devices). This leaf was initiated prior to the start of treatment, but expanded while under treatment conditions. We took additional measurements two months after the initiation of treatment. We used a chlorophyll meter (SPAD â€“ 502 by Konica Minolta) to determine the SPAD index, which measures relative chlorophyll content; reduction in SPAD index would indicate detrimental effects of water limitation. We calculated specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area divided by dry mass) by scanning a single leaf from each seedling to determine the leaf area (WD3 WinDIAS Leaf Image Analysis System by Delta-T Devices) and weighing oven dried leaves. For analysis, we excluded data for seedlings that died during the experiment. We also excluded the experimental treatment partner of any dead seedlings.</p>
