<p class="p">For the analysis of seedling height and total leaf length, we used the measurements at five weeks after the experimental treatment began and used only seedlings that were determined to be well established at that time. We also calculated a relative height increment for each seedling by determining the last measurement when the seedling had two or fewer leaves and the first measurement with eight or more leaves. The relative height increment is the difference between the natural logarithm of the two height measurements, divided by the difference in time.</p>
