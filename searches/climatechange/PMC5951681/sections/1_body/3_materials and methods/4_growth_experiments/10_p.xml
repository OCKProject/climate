<p class="p">We examined local adaptation using a Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>-F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> analysis (R QstFstComp v0.2, [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilbert and Whitlock, 2015</xref>]) for each phenotypic trait measured under each experimental condition. For each comparison, we estimated Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> under the model for offspring related as half-siblings through shared mothers and compared that value to the distribution of F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> values for the sampling sites included in the experiment. Statistical significance was determined based on the predicted null distribution of Q
 <sub class="sub">st</sub>-F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> using 10,000 simulation replicates.
