<p class="p">To examine the effect of provenance and environment on phenotype, we conducted experiments in climate controlled growth chambers under two different climate regimes. No power analysis was used to determine sample size during the design of the experiment. Sample size was determined based on our experience and judgment, with consideration of the availability of seed and space in the growth chambers. We selected six sites (11, B, D, G, T1, T3; asterisks in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1A</xref>) and six maternal lines per site that had sufficient seed. For each of the 36 maternal lines, we grew a minimum of 64 replicate seedlings, with four seeds planted per pot (6.5 cm x 6.5 cm x 20 cm pots with soil that was 80% Martin's mix and 20% sand). We germinated seeds in climate controlled chambers with 12 hr of light at 25°C and 12 hr of dark at 15°C. We set lights to mimic summer morning light (photosynthetic photon flux 370 nm = 82, 400 nm = 83, 420 nm = 78, 450 nm = 37, 530 nm = 31, 620 nm = 72, 660 nm = 28, 735 nm = 34, 850 nm = 89, 6500 K = 94 µmol/m
