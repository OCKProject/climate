<p class="p">Three weeks after germination, we sorted seedlings into treatment chambers using a randomized block design based on maternal line. In each of the two climate chambers, we grew eight or nine replicate seedlings from each maternal line. Climate conditions were determined with SolarCalc (

We ran the experimental conditions for 12–14 weeks and took phenotypic measurements at five time points:1, 2, 3, 5, and 11 weeks after the experimental treatment began. Measurements included seedling height, number of leaves, and total leaf length.
