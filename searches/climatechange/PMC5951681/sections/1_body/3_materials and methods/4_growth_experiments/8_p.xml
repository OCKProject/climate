<p class="p">We visualized phenotypic plasticity by examining interaction plots between maternal line and experimental condition for four response variables: stomatal conductance, leaf length to width ratio, SPAD index, and SLA. We statistically tested for an interaction between sampling site/maternal line and experimental condition with linear mixed-effect models using

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bates et al., 2015</xref>]) for each of the four response variables. Due to a lack of power to consider maternal line nested within sampling site, we ran two models for each response variable—one with maternal line and one with sampling site. These models included the experimental condition, sampling site or maternal line, and their interactions as fixed effects. We included block and sample pairings as random effects.
