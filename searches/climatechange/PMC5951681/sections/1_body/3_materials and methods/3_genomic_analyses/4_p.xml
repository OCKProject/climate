<p class="p">We obtained environmental data for the GDM from climate, elevation, soil, and landscape raster layers. Climate variables included 19 bioclimatic variables for the current time period (1960–1990), at 30 arc second resolution (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WorldClim, 2016b</xref>). Elevation was from a digital elevation model aggregated from 90 m resolution (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CGIAR-CSI, 2016</xref>). Soil data included available water capacity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus sampled at the surface (0–5 cm) and at depth (100–200 cm) (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CSIRO, 2016</xref>). Landscape data included the Prescott Index (a measure of water balance) and MrVBF (a topographic index) (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CSIRO, 2016</xref>). For future predictions, we used the 19 bioclimatic variables predicted for 2070 at 30 arc second resolution based on GCM MIROC5 for representative concentration pathway 8.5 (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WorldClim, 2016a</xref>), which is a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory showing continual increase in emissions over time. We determined the values for each variable at each sampling site based on GPS coordinates and used those values to calculate the environmental distances between sites.
