<p class="p">We examined the implications of the GDM model for seed sourcing decisions by selecting two hypothetical reforestation sites. We compared predicted future GDM values at these two hypothetical reforestation sites to current climate GDM values across the landscape of potential seed sources. This enabled us to generate a map of the predicted genomic similarity of potential seed sources to the hypothetical reforestation sites under climate change.</p>
