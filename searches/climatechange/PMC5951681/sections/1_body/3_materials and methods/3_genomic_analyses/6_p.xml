<p class="p">We cross validated the GDM model using a random 70% of the spatial sampling sites as training data and the remaining 30% of sites as test data and ran 1000 resampled iterations. We used the GDM models from the training sites to predict the genomic dissimilarity between the test sites and used Pearson's correlation to compare the predicted values to the observed values. To test the robustness of the geographic prediction from the GDM model, we visualized the geographic splines from 100 of these GDM models.</p>
