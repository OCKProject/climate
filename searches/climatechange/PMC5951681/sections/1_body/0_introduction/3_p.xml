<p class="p">Historically, restoration has often focused on geographically restricted local sources of seed under the premise that this would improve restoration outcomes by reducing the risk of maladaptation to local conditions and by preventing outbreeding depression (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Broadhurst et al., 2008</xref>). However, there are several potential drawbacks to this narrow local focus. In a fragmented system, narrow local seed sourcing reduces the number of potential source populations, thereby reducing the pool of available genetic material. This reduced gene pool may result in inbreeding depression in future generations, especially if combined with small population size (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Broadhurst et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the focus on maintaining local adaptation assumes a static environment, not the rapidly changing environments that occur today. When local conditions change, traits and genes that have conferred an advantage in the past may not be suitable in future environments. In recent years, climate adjusted provenancing has been proposed, providing a seed sourcing strategy that focuses on both genetic diversity and adaptability under predicted future conditions (
