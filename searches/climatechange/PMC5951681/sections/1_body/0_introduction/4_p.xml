<p class="p">To identify an appropriate seed sourcing strategy for a reforestation project, it is useful to characterize genomic variation in the target species with empirical data. These data can be used to infer patterns of Isolation By Distance (IBD) and Isolation By Environment (IBE). IBD describes the correlation between genomic distance and geographic distance, which arises when gene flow occurs more often between populations that are in close geographic proximity. IBE describes the correlation between genomic distance and environmental distance, while controlling for geographic distance (

IBE arises because environmental drivers can influence gene flow, so that migration rate is effectively modulated by the environment. This means IBE is detectable in genome-wide variation, and not just at loci mediating adaptation. Landscape genomic models can be generated that describe the relationship between genetic differentiation and both spatial and environmental distances (representing IBD and IBE). These predictive models can be used to optimize the genetic material selected for restoration and should improve long term outcomes (
