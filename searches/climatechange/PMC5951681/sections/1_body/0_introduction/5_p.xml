<p class="p">The extent of phenotypic plasticity in potential seed sources can be measured in growth assays of seedling traits across contrasting environmental conditions. The magnitude of the environmental response can be compared among maternal lines or populations and may identify populations that differ in their response to the environment. Such differing responses have been seen in some species of
