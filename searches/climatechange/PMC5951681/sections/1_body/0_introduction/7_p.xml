 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic>. To help determine an appropriate seed sourcing strategy, we fit the genotypic data to geographic distance and key environmental variables at the sites of origin. This enables characterization of isolation by distance across a broad area, providing an empirical estimate of ‘local’ for comparison with current practice for local provenancing. We also identify features of the abiotic environment that can further explain genomic differentiation after accounting for geographic distance. Additionally, we examine seedling growth under different simulated climate conditions to test for variation in growth traits and phenotypic plasticity both within and among sites. Our landscape genomic model, which can empirically define local provenances and identify variation suitable for predicted future climates, can help build resilient populations through scientifically based restoration.
