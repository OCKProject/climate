<p class="p">Species around the globe face rapidly changing environments, often in combination with habitat loss and fragmentation. These factors are expected to have a negative impact on biodiversity (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lindenmayer et al., 2010</xref>). Three processes enable species to survive altered conditions: migration, adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity (

We can help populations to become better adapted to future environmental conditions by assisting migration of gene pools across the landscape (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aitken et al., 2008</xref>). We can aid populations to survive in situ by ensuring that sufficient genomic variation exists for adaptation to changing environments (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>). We can enable individuals to respond to a greater range of environments by conserving existing phenotypic plasticity (
