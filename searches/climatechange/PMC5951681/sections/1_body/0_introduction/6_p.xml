 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus melliodora</italic> (A.Cunn. ex Schauer), commonly called yellow box, is an iconic Australian tree that is the subject of extensive restoration efforts across its distribution. It is a foundation species of a critically endangered ecological community: the White Box–Yellow Box–Blakely’s Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Threatened Species Scientific Committee, 2006</xref>). Efforts to restore this endangered woodland community are ongoing and restoration practitioners are seeking scientific recommendations to improve seed sourcing. Climate change is an important consideration in seed sourcing decisions because species distribution modelling predicts that most eucalypts will need to shift their distributions considerably in response (

 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> predicts that by 2090 the species distribution will shift toward the southeast and suitable areas will decrease by 77% as a result of environmental changes (
