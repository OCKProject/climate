For example, seed sources can be selected to restore historical patterns of gene flow across fragmented landscapes and to incorporate high levels of available genomic diversity. If plasticity varies among populations, seed can be selected to augment the phenotypic plasticity of individuals at restoration sites. Seed sources can also be matched with current or predicted future climates, enabling assisted migration to favorable environments (
