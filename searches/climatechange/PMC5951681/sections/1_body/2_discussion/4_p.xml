<p class="p">In addition to isolation by distance, our model identified soil nitrogen, temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the wettest quarter, and isothermality as significant environmental drivers of genome-wide patterns of variation across the landscape. Of these variables, the climate variables are predicted to change rapidly over time. Change in soil nitrogen content might occur over longer time scales, but it is difficult to forecast due to complex biotic feedbacks (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brevik, 2013</xref>). This suggests that optimal seed sourcing will need to balance the tracking of rapidly changing climate variables with the need to account for variables that are more stable due to their dependence on stable features of geology, topography, or hydrology. The different time scales also highlight the important concern that key environmental variables may become uncoupled, resulting in less than ideal conditions for this species across the landscape.
