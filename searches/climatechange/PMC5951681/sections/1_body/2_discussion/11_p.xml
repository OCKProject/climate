<p class="p">Our landscape genomic model can guide seed selection by empirically defining local provenances and identifying variation suitable for predicted future climates. This understanding of the relationship between environmental and genomic variation can be combined with other types of information, such as basic biological knowledge of the ecological community and best agronomic practices in restoration, to establish foundation species and ecosystems with the highest probability of success in rapidly changing environments.</p>
