 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Broadhurst et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to our analysis, that analysis also found temperature and precipitation variables to be important, but the exact bioclimatic variables identified did not overlap. This is not unexpected given that niche modelling identifies drivers that define the environmental tolerance of the species, while the analysis presented here identifies drivers for genomic variation within the species.
