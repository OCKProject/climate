<p class="p">A genetic study of ecologically relevant loci in 13 alpine plant species in the European Alps found that, after accounting for broad spatial patterns, temperature and/or precipitation variables were the primary drivers of genetic variation in all but one species (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Poelchau and Hamrick, 2012</xref>). In one species, an integrated environmental measure, incorporating temperature and precipitation, was the primary driver; in the second species the primary driver was geographic distance; in the third species the results were ambiguous (
