<p class="p">Our analyses of phenotypic variation found no site-specific variation in phenotypic plasticity that would enable us to identify provenances better able to cope with rapid environmental change. However, plasticity is trait-specific, so traits that are hypothesized to be important for establishment and survival should continue to be investigated because they may provide valuable information for restoration projects. Importantly, our growth experiments support the results of the genomic analyses, showing the remarkable extent of variation both among sites and within sites, further supporting our recommendation that seed sources incorporate the high level of variation that occurs naturally in
