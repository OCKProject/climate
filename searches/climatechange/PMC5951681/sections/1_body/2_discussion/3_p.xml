<p class="p">Examining the relationship between genomic and geographic distance, we are able to empirically define ‘local’ in this species to be on the order of 500 km, which is substantially farther than the current practice. These results mean restoration projects can and should source seed more broadly across the landscape, with limited risk of mixing highly evolutionarily diverged material. In a highly fragmented landscape this will increase the number of favorable source sites, enabling the collection of higher quality seed with increased genetic diversity (
