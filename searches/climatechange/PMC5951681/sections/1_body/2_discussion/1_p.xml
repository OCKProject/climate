 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus melliodora</italic> is a foundation species in a critically endangered woodland community that now occupies a fraction of its former distribution and is the subject of restoration projects across its native range. Our examination of the distribution of genomic and phenotypic variation across the range of this species provides valuable information for sourcing seed for restoration, including empirically defining local provenances and matching genotypes to predicted future environmental conditions.
