<p class="p">The focus of this study was the whole-genome population structure that reflects historical adaptation, gene flow, and demography. Analyses of individual genes was beyond the scope of this study due to the low resolution GBS genotyping and the limited extent of linkage disequilibrium in

Specific alleles that potentially confer increased fitness in the face of a rapidly changing climate would be useful targets for restoration projects.
