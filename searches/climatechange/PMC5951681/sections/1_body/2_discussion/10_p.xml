 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> across its native distribution. We found high genomic and phenotypic diversity within sites, as well as shared across the range. This naturally occurring variation can provide a basis for adaptation to rapidly changing environments and it should be incorporated into restoration projects through strategic seed sourcing. It is important to note that our genomic analyses were based on mature trees that predate extensive land clearing for agriculture. It remains to be determined whether human modifications of the landscape have disrupted the historical patterns of gene flow, resulting in more fragmented and inbred populations. Genomic analyses of seedlings or saplings at these sites may show different results, although our phenotypic studies using seedlings produced results concordant with our genomic analyses.
