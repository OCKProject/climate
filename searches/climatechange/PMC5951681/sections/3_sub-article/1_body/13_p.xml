<p class="p">The authors produced a GBS dataset in the non-model foundation species 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus melliodora</italic> using data from 275 trees from 37 sampling sites. They used these data to infer the rate of isolation by distance and to model the effects of environmental variables and geographic distance on F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> among populations and compared this model to a model using projected climatic data. They also assessed phenotypic variation in seedlings grown in simulated 'current' and 'future' conditions and found variation in responses among sites.
