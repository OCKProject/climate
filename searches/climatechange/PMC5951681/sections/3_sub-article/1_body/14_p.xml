<p class="p">The main message of the paper is that the genotypes that are ecologically the best-fit to a particular location can come from a much broader geographic range than expected. This has implications that are highly relevant to the design of restoration projects in this species (and perhaps more generally). It suggests that optimal restoration should include a relatively diverse set of individuals.</p>
