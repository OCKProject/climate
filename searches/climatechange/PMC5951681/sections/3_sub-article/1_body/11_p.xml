<p class="p">This is a potentially interesting manuscript linking genomic variation to functional variation to potential conservation planning. However the manuscript is not aided by the writing and figures. The figures seem very crude and often don't convey the message cleanly. Then this is backed up by incomplete writing that does not have transitions or explanations leaving numerous thoughts and topics to seem to randomly appear and disappear without a coordinated presentation. There is a coordinated thought in this work but that thought needs to be transmitted through precise writing that walks a generalist audience through each and every line of thought.</p>
