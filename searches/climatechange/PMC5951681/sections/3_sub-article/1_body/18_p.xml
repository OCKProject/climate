<p class="p">With respect to the identified environmental drivers/variables, is there any evidence in the literature that similar studies (if any) of related or other species have same drivers? It appears the "usual culprits" are common across most species/plants: some aspect of rainfall, temperature, soil aspect (subsection “Genomic Analyses”, third and fourth paragraphs), although the below-ground variables are difficult to measure?</p>
