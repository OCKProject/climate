<p class="p">We found low genome wide F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> values, but would expect that F
 <sub class="sub">st</sub> scans would find outlier loci, either by random chance or possibly due to loci linked to local adaptation. Our results could be used to select samples to minimize issues, such as co-ancestry, and provide a more powerful dataset for a future study to identify loci underlying potential adaptation.
