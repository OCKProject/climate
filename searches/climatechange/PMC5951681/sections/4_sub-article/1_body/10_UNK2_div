 <p class="p" xmlns="">Subsection “Genomic Analyses” – statistical modelling and inference problems with sample sizes substantially smaller than the number of available covariates are challenging – often referred to as large p small n problem. Furthermore, the problem is more complicated when we have multiple correlated responses. Out of interest, how do your models deal with such an issue i.e., large number of markers on a small number of phenotype/environmental variables?</p>
