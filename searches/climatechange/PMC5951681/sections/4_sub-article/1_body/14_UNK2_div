 <p class="p" xmlns="">With respect to F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> estimates â€“ perhaps the authors can think more about this but may not be related specifically to this study. For example, it is now common for population geneticists to estimate F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> for a large number of loci across the genome. However, one surprising result of such F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> scans is the often high proportion (&gt;1% and sometimes &gt;10%) of outliers detected, and this is often interpreted as evidence for pervasive local adaptation. There have been arguments that suggest that correlated co-ancestry inflates the neutral variance in F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> when compared to its expectation under an island model of population structure. As a consequence, I find that results of F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> scans have become somewhat difficult to interpret in terms of their genome distribution and their effects on phenotype. Perhaps the authors can comment on this in light of their F
  <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sub> results.
