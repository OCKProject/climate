 <p class="p">The paper surveys genomic variation, using approx. 9400 SNPs in 275 individual trees from 37 sites across the range of Eucalyptus melliodora. Key environmental variables are combined with these genomic data to determine resilient populations in the face of climate change. The paper is well written, and the findings are clearly presented. The Introduction section introduces the issue well and puts the current study in the context based on the background of previous studies. The methodology is presented precisely and exhaustively. The results are well presented and discussed. I have only a few general questions, some of which could be beyond the scope of the paper. The questions could be ether addressed in Methodology and Results, or only mentioned (explained) in the Discussion section. The work is certainly of value to readers of the journal.</p>
 <p class="p">With respect to the identified environmental drivers/variables, is there any evidence in the literature that similar studies (if any) of related or other species have same drivers? It appears the "usual culprits" are common across most species/plants: some aspect of rainfall, temperature, soil aspect (subsection “Genomic Analyses”, third and fourth paragraphs), although the below-ground variables are difficult to measure?</p>
