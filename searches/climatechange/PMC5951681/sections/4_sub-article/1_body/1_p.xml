<p class="p">We designed the study to focus on how environment and geography affect the genome as a whole, rather than the impact on specific genes. Given the low genomic resolution of the GBS data in a species where linkage disequilibrium extends only a few hundred base pairs, we feel that a gene level analysis would not provide additional insights. To address this important point, we have added text to the Introduction and genomic results that clarifies our intention to focus on the effects on the genome as a whole, rather than on specific genes. We have also added a paragraph to the Discussion regarding a potential follow-up study using whole genome sequencing to identify adaptive alleles.</p>
