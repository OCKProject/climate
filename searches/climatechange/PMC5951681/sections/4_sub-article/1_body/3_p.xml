<p class="p">We have added a discussion comparing the drivers we identified with those identified in niche modelling of 
 <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> and within species genetic variation in other systems. Given the different methods and environmental variables used, direct comparisons between studies are difficult, as are insights into broad trends. Some analyses focus on putatively neutral loci, while other focus on putatively adaptive outlier loci. The studies usually include some measures of temperature and precipitation, but the exact variants on these factors are often different between studies. There are numerous non-climate variables available, such as soil or topography, which vary substantially between studies. The different methods and suites of environmental variables used in each study obscure broad trends that may exist.
