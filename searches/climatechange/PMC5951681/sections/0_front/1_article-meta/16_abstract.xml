 <p class="p">Yellow box, or 
  <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus melliodora</italic>, is an emblematic Australian tree that is essential to many native ecosystems. Some of these environments are now critically endangered, and replanting yellow box trees is one of the first steps to try to restore them.
 </p>
 <p class="p">However, it can be difficult for reforestation practitioners to decide where to collect the seeds they will use to replant an area. They have to select seeds that carry the genetic information that gives the trees the best chances of surviving now and in the future. This is a complex task because climate change creates fast-changing environments.</p>
 <p class="p">Here, Supple et al. collect genetic material from 275 
  <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic> trees at 36 different sites. Genetic analyses show that the yellow box trees from these sites exchange their genetic material and do not form isolated populations. This means that the seeds do not need to be sourced from near the reforestation site, but can be collected from areas much further away. This results in higher quality seeds for reforestation because seeds from more sites will include more genetic diversity.
 </p>
 <p class="p">Supple et al. then use information about the local climate, such as temperature and rain levels, at the sites where the samples were gathered to create a model that describes the relationship between genetic, geographical, and environmental factors. This helps identify which sites produce the seeds that will grow best under particular conditions. In addition, the seedlings from these sites are grown in the laboratory to see how well they fare in different types of environments. It therefore becomes possible to match a reforestation site with the seeds that will thrive in the future climate of the area.</p>
 <p class="p">Sharing this knowledge with conservationists will help to guide their replanting strategies for 
  <italic class="italic">E. melliodora</italic>. The method can also be applied to other plant species and restoration projects, so it could ultimately shape resilient ecosystems that can cope with climate change.
