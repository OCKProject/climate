 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) among households within the study sites. Results from a two-step cluster analysis (hierarchical and non-hierarchical using continuous and categorical variables) are displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> along the three pillars that informed the cluster analysis: agricultural assets, income streams (a proxy for nonfarm livelihood diversification), and homestead characteristics (viewed as a key indicator of wealth in Kibirizi). These livelihood groups are used in subsequent analyses alongside other variables to consider the effects of institutional change on adaptive capacity and the ways in which livelihood capitals are employed to adopt new land use and livelihood strategies amid variable and changing climates.
