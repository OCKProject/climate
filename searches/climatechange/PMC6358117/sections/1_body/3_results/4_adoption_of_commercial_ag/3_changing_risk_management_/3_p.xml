<p id="p0175" class="p">One result of these governance changes is that 91 percent of households now cultivate fewer crop varieties than they did ten years ago. Not only does this eradication of flexible decision-making institutions debilitate 
 <italic class="italic">ex-ante</italic> capacities, it also has implications for 
 <italic class="italic">in-season</italic> capacities. As discussed above, smallholders must submit contracts (which both bind producers to the state’s selected crops and allow calculation of the amount of seed to be delivered to particular rural areas) months ahead of growing seasons. This affords little leeway to adjust cropping decisions in response to climate cues. Constraints to 
 <italic class="italic">in-season</italic> capacities are most pronounced in terraced areas, where producers risk land appropriation if they choose not to cultivate their holdings for a season. Negative effects associated with these policy changes are widespread, as summarized in the following responses: ‘We don't have good production and we lose all the crops planted;’ ‘we harvest less and we are obligated to buy additional food on market;’ ‘this program is the main cause of hunger because we are growing just one crop.’
