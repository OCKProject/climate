<p id="p0190" class="p">Given that they are accessible only to households that already have substantial generic capacity, reliance on institutions such as Tubura does not confer inclusive risk mitigation. Moreover, lack of access to the core institutions of the CIP among the poorest households creates a paradox in that these households are relatively more invested in the CIP than are their wealthier neighbors by proportion of land area. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the poorest households have more than one third of their land under CIP management, while the wealthier households have less than one fifth of their land set aside for the program. In other words, those with less institutional support to make the transition to commercial agriculture are, often unwillingly, under greater pressure to alter production practices in line with the government’s vision. Many interview respondents among lower capacity households expressed challenges in how institutional change and climatic shocks have intersected over the past five years. For example, an elderly male smallholder explained:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p class="p">“They told us not to grow sweet potato and cassava and only to grow wheat and beans, and farmers were dying of hunger. It cost between 5,000 and 6,000 Frw for a basket of sweet potatoes [about ten times the typical price].”</p>
  <p class="p">
   <bold class="bold">Interviewer:</bold> “Is it the government policy that caused sweet potatoes to become so expensive?” ‘No. it is because of two reasons. The first reason is that there was too much sun [drought] and people could not cultivate sweet potatoes. Then after rain those who did plant sweet potato had them uprooted by local leaders.’
