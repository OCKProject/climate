<p id="p0170" class="p">Ability to employ this range of strategies has traditionally comprised Kibirizi smallholders’ specific adaptive capacities. These capacities are facilitated by various social institutions operating at multiple levels. Many of these institutions are currently in flux due to intersecting social-environmental changes (summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Several key social institutions pertain to flexible decision-making at household and parcel levels concerning which crops to grow. Respondents noted that norms of land-use flexibility are deeply engrained in Kibirizi. However, the state’s crop regionalization and land use consolidation programs have sharply eroded household autonomy over cropping decisions: 75 percent of survey respondents indicated that the government primarily makes cropping decisions. In short, this means that smallholders are increasingly compelled to grow crops selected by local leaders for their supposed economic value rather than selecting crops themselves according to household needs, agroecological features of their parcels, and climate risk. As interview respondents noted: ‘Decisions have changed because of the government program and performance contracts;’ ‘The plots are under land use consolidation where one selected crop by local leaders is grown;’ ‘All decisions are coming from our local leaders.’
