 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> further clarifies other factors associated with access to these key land types. Intensity of CIP activity is negatively related to accessibility of places to plant CIP crops, suggesting that where the program is most strict, access to places to plant food security crops is also lowest. Relatedly, CIP intensity, in combination with lower household capacity and numbers of field locations stands out in the number of climatic and other challenges experienced by households on CIP land. Similarly, households living in areas of higher CIP intensity are more likely to run out of food earlier than they were ten years ago (‘consume household produced food earlier’ in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The implication of this finding in terms of specific adaptive capacity is that even while valley land is becoming more important as a risk management strategy, it is becoming further out of reach for households living closest to the margin.
