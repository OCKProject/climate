<p id="p0195" class="p">Marshland in Kibirizi has become less accessible with the transition from ownership by local associations to more formal cooperatives. Many respondents noted that they were once part of relatively informal associations that regulated marshland use prior to 2005. At that time, people were cultivating as they liked in marshlands, often intercropping sweet potato with maize or other crops, a strategy seen to increase resilience of the plots to flooding. Now, marshlands are part of the CIP and only one crop is grown at a time. Respondents expressed frustration about this transition, noting the challenge of joining cooperatives due to high cost and the fact that cooperatives quickly reached a cap after which further members were not admitted. They lamented the loss of decision-making power over crop choice and spoke of frequent flooding that has occurred in marshlands ever since they were drained and cultivated on a large scale in just one crop.</p>
