<p id="p0160" class="p">In addition to changing climate, there is widespread acknowledgement of two major changes to land management throughout Kibirizi. First, four crops that were once extensively cultivated (sweet potato, cassava, ciraza, and sorghum) are now effectively forbidden by the GoR. According to respondents and local leaders, the chief reason for this shift is that these crops are not part of the CIP due to their low market values. This is in spite of wide agreement that these are among the most drought and flood tolerant crops, especially when compared to much riskier CIP crops. We also explored with producers the issues of adopting the CIP in terms of institutions of climate risk management. Intersections between the government’s intensification program and issues of climatic uncertainty in Kibirizi were evident early on and throughout this study. When asked about any difficulties of adopting CIP land use practices, study participants often couched responses in terms of climate. For example:

We recognize that land use consolidation is important but due to climate change we are losing. There is no means for irrigating during drought.’ (focus group, October 2014)</p>
