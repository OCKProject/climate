<p id="p0210" class="p">Woodlots are widely seen to have proliferated in Kibirizi over the past ten years. Over 74 percent of survey respondents noted that trees have increased in their umudugudu during this period. This is due to the perceived resilience of woodlots to climatic shocks and their importance as a source of cash once the wood is harvested and sold for charcoal or for construction. In the minds of many study participants, the rapid adoption of woodlots is closely linked to 
 <italic class="italic">Ruchamakara</italic> (meaning “charcoal making hunger”), one of the worst famines in the past century. The Ruchamakara hunger period is understood to have arisen following three growing seasons of markedly low yield due to adverse climatic conditions. Though the order of climate shock events is not completely clear, most respondents indicated that it began with a prolonged period of drought that negatively affected two seasons. This drought is said to have been followed by unusually heavy rains in a third growing season. The prolonged duration of this hunger period reportedly caused some households to migrate, some individuals to perish, and a great many to participate in the production of charcoal. Charcoal making, as the name of the hunger period would indicate, was widely seen as the only recourse for households to purchase food from market in the wake of three failed harvests. Ruchamakara occurred around the year 2000, and stories still circulated of even stumps being cut out of the ground and processed in charcoal kilns. Respondents in Kibirizi also clarified that there are structural factors underlying increased tree farming. The GoR has incentivized woodlot adoption, ensuring that tree seedlings of two eucalypt species are made widely available at subsidized rates (seedlings cost 20 Frw each). Additionally, the GoR requires that all fields beyond 45 degrees (deemed too steep to farm) must be planted with trees to reduce erosion. The 45-degree slope rule is enforced by local leaders, who are often called upon to settle disputes regarding woodlots. This explicit erosion-reduction measure nests within a broader afforestation policy that has been implemented throughout Rwanda.
