<p id="p0220" class="p">However, adoption of woodlots is a highly uneven adaptation. Interviews clarified that woodlots are by all accounts recognized as a land use option largely available to wealthier households. And, as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, the percentage of total household land in woodlots correlates strongly with livelihood group. Only 26.7 percent of the poorest households own any woodlot, which is generally small and used to gather firewood, compared to 93.8 percent of among the wealthiest households, many of whom own large woodlots which are harvested for making charcoal or selling timber. Further illustrating this discrepancy, the wealthiest group of households has roughly half of their total land in woodlots while the poorest households have less than ten percent of their landholdings in woodlots. This finding is strongly supported by in-depth interviews, wherein respondents commonly acknowledged that although woodlots are the preferred climate-resilient land use, they are unable to convert to woodlots given the need to continuously produce food for their families. Indeed, while half of wealthier households report expanding woodlots in the past ten years, only 8 percent of the poorest households have planted more trees in that time period. For wealthier households, conversion to woodlots has become an important livelihood diversification strategy, as the following quotes illustrate:

  <p class="p">‘The number of trees has increased so much. People who have land for tree planting do so.’</p>
  <p class="p">‘They started to grow more trees after realizing timber are being exported and trees are fetching much money. Before, people were planting only in high risk zones but now they are planting in land favorable for crops.’</p>
