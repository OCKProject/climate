<p id="p0215" class="p">Converting agriculture to woodlot is an adaptive land use strategy that has thus come about through the intersection of a changing climate, declining soil fertility, increased connectivity to urban areas where charcoal is delivered, and government policy to increase tree cover. It has become a generic adaptive capacity strategy that also enhances specific adaptive capacity to climate change. Whether or not they currently owned a woodlot, respondents frequently acknowledged that they could plant trees in a woodlot, put very little work into their upkeep, and after ten or 15â€¯years hire somebody to cut the trees into poles for home construction (if the trunks are straight enough) or charcoal (if the trunks are less straight). Both of these outputs provide substantial cash income to the woodlot owner. Perhaps more importantly, woodlots can be effectively cashed in at any time, whenever the household is most in need of money. Indeed, numerous interview respondents indicated that trees are an effective income diversification strategy, even preferable to having money in a bank.</p>
