<p id="p0145" class="p">Our results on the processes by which adaptive capacity is unevenly built are organized as follows. We first depict household differences in terms of livelihood capitals. We then explore the multidimensional processes of adaptation, demonstrating how livelihood capitals and capabilities – and entrenched social inequalities – are woven into adaptation pathways. We show that smallholders must draw on their generic capacities to implement risk management mechanisms, leveraging multiple capitals to maintain production of subsistence crops while also adopting two new land use strategies: 1) commercial agriculture in line with the state’s vision of modern farming systems, including valley and marshland cultivation during dry seasons; and 2) woodlots for timber and charcoal production. In discussing the mechanisms of these adaptations, we illustrate how smallholders come to differ in their capacities to adapt amid social and environmental change, the role of social institutions in this process, and how differential capacities lead to uneven livelihood adaptation pathways.</p>
