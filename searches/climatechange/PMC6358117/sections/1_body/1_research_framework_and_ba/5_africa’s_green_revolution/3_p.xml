<p id="p0095" class="p">However, political economic and agroecological contexts in contemporary SSA poorly resemble those of 1960s andÂ 1970s Asia. In contrast to consistent national markets and robust state-led subsidy programs that facilitated Green Revolutions in India, for example, decades of neoliberal reforms in SSA have meant weakened state involvement in agriculture and dependence on erratic global markets (

There is growing evidence that input-based agricultural intensification has done little to meet pro-poor development goals in SSA. Although aggregate crop yields may have increased in some places, national-level food production figures say little about local-level food access (
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bezner Kerr, 2013</xref>). Technology-driven intensification policies appear to have done little to address longstanding unevenness in land and resource access among smallholders, resulting in exacerbated malnutrition and inequality among some rural communities while large-holders, urban populations, and agribusiness benefit (
