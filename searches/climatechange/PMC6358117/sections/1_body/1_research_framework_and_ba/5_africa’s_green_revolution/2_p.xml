<p id="p0090" class="p">Over the past decade, development policies across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have come to re-center on smallholder agriculture as an engine of economic growth. In hopes of catalyzing an African Green Revolution (

 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moseley et al., 2015</xref>). As in earlier Green Revolutions in Mexico and Asia, contemporary agricultural intensification programs throughout SSA center on smallholders, aiming to encourage households to adopt high-yielding varieties of maize, rice, and wheat and to increase application of agrochemicals, which these varieties often require to achieve optimal productivity. Africa’s Green Revolution has thus far taken shape as a top-down enterprise, with governments and development agencies incentivizing and sometimes enforcing the increased adoption of technologies (

Not only do intensification policies aim to sustainably end hunger and malnourishment—which have abated very little in SSA compared to other regions—they illustrate a renewed development emphasis on agriculture as an engine of overall economic growth (

Increased inputs (such as hybrid seed, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides) and agroengineering (terracing, draining wetlands, and irrigating fields) are thus positioned as essential to shore up ‘yield gaps’ and thereby curtail further expansion of agricultural land into biodiverse areas (
