<p id="p0050" class="p">To investigate how adaptive capacity is differentially built amid development transitions in rural Rwanda, we integrate recent insight on the multiple components of adaptive capacity and adaptation pathways with livelihoods perspectives, which have long attended to multi-scalar processes of agrarian change within which smallholders make decisions (

We focus on adaptive decision-making in the context of Green Revolution-inspired agricultural intensification policies and related programs of rural transformation in Rwanda. Our analytical approach enables us to 1) visualize the array of social-environmental processes that interact to shape smallholdersâ€™ adaptive capacities and livelihood adaptation options and 2) identify patterns in how these adaptive capacities arise unevenly in accordance with pre-existing livelihood portfolios and social inequalities. This
