<p id="p0080" class="p">More specifically, we approach adaptive capacity as a process that unfolds in places over time by building from recent work on adaptation pathways. Doing so helps fill a crucial gap concerning how some groups and individuals come to have more or less adaptive capacity than others. Adaptation pathways research illuminates how adaptation decisions emerge and build on one another over time and how adaptation trajectories can vary by social groups and across levels of organization (e.g. household, community) (

By de-emphasizing assessments of adaptation ‘successes’ or ‘failures’ and instead highlighting fluidity in adaptation processes, this work depicts how seemingly discrete adaptation decisions coalesce into broader trajectories of change (
