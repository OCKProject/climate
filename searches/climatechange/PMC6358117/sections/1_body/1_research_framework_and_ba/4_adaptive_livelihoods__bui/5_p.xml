<p id="p0085" class="p">In this paper, we consider how adaptation pathways emerge amid development transitions by investigating the interplay among specific and generic adaptive capacities. This adaptive livelihoods approach encourages us to consider how adaptive capacity is unevenly built. That is, how individuals, households, and social groups come to differ in their abilities to adaptively respond to climatic variability and change. As we discuss below, this approach helps understand links between development and smallholder adaptation to climate change. Specifically, we assert that assessments of adaptive capacity can be more constructively framed by considering development policies and programs as imbuing complex negotiations and interactions among diverse actors that shape adaptation pathways. We demonstrate this approach through a case study of how differential adaptive capacities emerge in Rwanda amid development transitions associated with the ‘African Green Revolution’ (
