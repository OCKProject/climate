 <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nussbaum and Sen (1993, p. 3)</xref> assert that the “capability of a person refers to the various alternative combinations of functionings, any one of which (any combination, that is) the person can choose to have.” The work of 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leach et al. (1999, p. 232)</xref> builds upon this by advocating for an environmental entitlements framework to explain “how the consequences of environmental change in general, and access to and control over natural resources in particular, are also socially differentiated.” Methodologically based in assessments of these capabilities, livelihoods approaches provide a useful contribution to adaptive capacity assessment by enabling appreciation of the diverse factors that shape heterogeneous opportunities for people. Put differently, capabilities—and fundamental livelihood possibilities—are shaped through power-laden, context specific processes (
