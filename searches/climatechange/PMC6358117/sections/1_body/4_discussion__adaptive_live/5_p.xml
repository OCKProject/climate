<p id="p0245" class="p">In summary, an approach that combines longer term concerns of adaptation pathways with the multiple components of adaptive capacity can help us understand how complex development processes influence households’ adaptive capacities to climate change. On top of having limited specific capacities due to these new institutional arrangements, poorer households are experiencing food shortages that stem from the challenges of implementing land use according to CIP specifications. Furthermore, without access to woodlots or enough valley land, poorer households have difficulty engaging in land use and livelihood practices that help to strengthen their fundamental livelihood capitals in the face of an uncertain climate. This demonstrates that when agricultural intensification policies focus exclusively on building general livelihood capacities through commercialized agriculture they can undermine specific adaptive capacities, leading to unwitting adoption of riskier farming practices. Opportunities can emerge for alternative risk management mechanisms. However, our findings illustrate that the adoption of these alternate specific capacities can be highly uneven as it is often rooted in fundamental livelihood capitals and capabilities (or ‘generic capacities’). As the above narrative illustrates, a series of climatically adverse seasons—as occurred from 2013 to 2016 in Kibirizi—can set in place a downward spiral that will make it even more challenging for the poorest smallholder households to climb out of poverty. These divergent synergies (negative for poorer households, positive for wealthier households) are illustrated in
