<p id="p0230" class="p">The above results demonstrate that agricultural intensification and afforestation policies in SSA intersect with changing and variable climates to shape pathways for adapting land use strategies and livelihoods. In rain-fed smallholder farming systems, the success of these policies can be predicated on how they facilitate adaptive capacities to adjust practices to mitigate increasing climatic variability and uncertainty. Our findings from southwest Rwanda suggest that land use transitions aligned with the ‘New African Green Revolution,’ a mandate of intensified, commercial-oriented agriculture, have uneven effects on the diverse range of smallholder households in the midst of global climate change. CIP-prescribed land use practices have been differentially adopted in Kibirizi, with households closest to the margin putting proportionately more of their land into the program than households with more diversified land use systems and livelihood portfolios. This has meant that smallholders most reliant on subsistence agriculture have felt the largest impact of the destabilization of local social institutions that enabled flexible decision-making in the past. The poorest households experience far more yield-reducing challenges (both climatic and non-climatic) in fields planted under CIP-specifications, challenges that are exacerbated by the degree of intensity of CIP activity, with the most strictly regulated terraced areas showing the largest negative effects on household abilities to produce enough food and to continue planting core food security crops together with their forced adoption of commercial agriculture.</p>
