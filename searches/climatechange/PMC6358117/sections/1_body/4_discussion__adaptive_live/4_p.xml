<p id="p0240" class="p">By contrast, a majority of smallholder households could be classified as risk averse in that their circumstances preclude diversifying into riskier livelihoods and/or land uses. For such groups, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eakin et al. (2014)</xref> argue that development policies should aim to “build generic capacities without undermining the existing endogenous capacities for risk management: i.e., their specific capacities” (p. 3). Yet, our findings indicate that development resources are being expended in ways that provoke further inequality in household abilities to access and adopt climate risk mitigation mechanisms. The case of uneven adoption of woodlots as a climate-resilient land use strategy further illustrates how uneven adaptation pathways are produced through the interface of development policy and climate change. Faced with more uncertain climate and decreased soil fertility, households with surplus land have been able to capitalize on subsidized access to tree seedlings by dramatically expanding woodlots across their landholdings. Yet those without these bundles of resources and livelihoods (especially nonfarm work) have not adopted woodlots as a land use strategy. This uneven ability to invest in woodlots curtails adaptation pathways for many households, who instead are forced to adopt CIP agriculture on much of their land. Relatedly, the proliferation of woodlots also means less available land for rent for poorer households to produce food, which in turn is a factor in escalating land prices.
