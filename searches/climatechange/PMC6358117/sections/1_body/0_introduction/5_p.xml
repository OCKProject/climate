<p id="p0040" class="p">In this paper, we build upon this work on adaptation pathways and the sub-components of adaptive capacity. We investigate how adaptive capacities are unevenly shaped amid development transitions in rural Rwanda and how this leads to differential adaptation pathways for smallholder households. This paper illustrates how development interventions that emphasize input-led agricultural intensification have uneven outcomes for smallholders' capacities to adapt to climate change and other risks. In so doing, this research speaks to the need to reformulate development policies in ways that can address deeply-rooted social inequalities and facilitate “transformative adaptation” (

 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pelling, 2011</xref>). The paper presents the results of a mixed-methods case study of four communities in rural Rwanda. Two questions frame our analysis: (1) How do cross-scalar social, political economic, and environmental processes converge to shape smallholders’ adaptive capacities? and (2) How do these uneven capacities lead to differential adaptation pathways?
