 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clay, 2018a</xref>). Adaptive capacity comprises the assests that people can draw on to change as well as the power, knowledge, flexibility, and agency to decide whether to change or not (
 <xref rid="b9005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cinner et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work suggests that local institutions are key mediators of adaptive capacity (

 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Some have encouraged differentiating between “specific” adaptive capacities (those explicitly addressing climate-related risk) and “generic” capacities (i.e. general livelihood components and the structural constraints leading to inequalities in education, income, or political autonomy) and examining positive and negative feedback between the two (

 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lemos et al., 2013</xref>). Others suggest an ‘adaptation pathways’ approach to visualize how the dynamic, multi-scalar processes shaping vulnerability and adaptation coalesce over time and shape adaptation trajectories (

 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wise et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to temporally-static framings, adaptation pathways work illustrates fluidity in decisions and helps uncover how certain adaptations come to stabilize over time (
