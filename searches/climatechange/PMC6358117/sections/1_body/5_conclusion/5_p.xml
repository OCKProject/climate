<p id="p0265" class="p">To broader work at the interface of climate and development, this paper contributes understanding of how uneven adaptive capacities can arise through interacting social-environmental processes over time (
 <xref rid="b9050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watts, 1983</xref>). Development research and policy must actively consider such dynamics whether or not a study or program specifically targets climate adaptation. Optimistically, adaptation processes can embody the ‘potential to constitute or to contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge claims’ (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eriksen, Nightingale, &amp; Eakin, 2015, p. 523</xref>) and active application of pathways approaches through participatory work and continuous reflection on management paradigms can empower individuals to take action to remake institutions (
 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wise et al., 2014</xref>). However, rigid institutions of environmental governance can also constrain livelihood adaptations (
