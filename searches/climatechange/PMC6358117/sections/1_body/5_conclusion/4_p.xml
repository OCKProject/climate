<p id="p0260" class="p">This research addresses a deeper issue: whether the orientation of Green Revolution inspired agricultural development approaches towards economic growth precludes consideration of risk management as a policy component. These results suggest that large-scale intensification programs with externally prescribed quotas for planting export crops can exacerbate existing risks and introduce new risks in the form of crops ill-suited for the region or for particular parcels or farming systems. The negative impacts of cropping mandates are particularly evident during rainfall deviations and among households lacking capitals to invest in commercial crops (

Absent such attention, crop productivity gains will come at the expense of disadvantaged individuals’ livelihoods. For Rwanda’s agricultural policy agenda, care should be taken to ensure that the most vulnerable groups do not slide further into poverty. Specifically, rather than applying the CIP indiscriminately across relatively arbitrary spatial jurisdictions that comprise administrative units, the intensification program should be designed to adaptively respond to spatial and temporal variations across the mountainous agro-ecological landscape. For households lacking the requisite generic capacities to adapt successfully, it is essential to consider options for easing the requirements of compulsory crop cultivation. This need for flexibility resonates across resource use systems, as a recent case from Botswana illustrates (
