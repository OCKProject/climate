<p id="p0250" class="p">This study considers household impacts and responses to climatic shocks and change (including late rain onset, drought, and heavy rain) amid broader social-environmental changes in Rwanda to understand how smallholder producers come to differ in their abilities to mitigate and adapt to climatic uncertainty, variability, and change. Findings show that certain combinations of livelihood and land use practices enable households to more effectively cope with discrete climatic shocks and adaptively respond to perceived climate changes so as to mitigate current and future risks of uncertain and variable rainfall. We demonstrate that adaptation options emerging within the context of social-environmental change are attenuated by differential adaptation pathways that embody pre-existing resource access regimes and power asymmetries. Individuals and households must navigate new institutions in order to mitigate risks of increasingly uncertain precipitation patterns and episodes of drought and heavy rain. Mitigating risk now requires either accessing institutions associated with the CIP (which require surplus land, income, livestock, and labor) or diversifying land use into woodlots (which demands surplus land). Households lacking these resources have limited access to newly important specific capacities (crop insurance, woodlots, and dry season planting areas) to effectively respond to risks of climatic variability and uncertainty and to adapt to climate change. The overall result is that an important segment of the smallholder farming population in Rwanda cannot effectively adapt livelihood and land-use portfolios to navigate structural changes and climatic changes.</p>
