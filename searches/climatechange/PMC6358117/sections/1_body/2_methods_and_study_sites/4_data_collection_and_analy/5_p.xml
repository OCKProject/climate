<p id="p0140" class="p">In-depth interviews complement quantitative data with rich detail on power relations and the effects of institutional change. As a case study, this work does not consider regional differences. However, it provides a comprehensive picture on how development transitions intersect with broader social-ecological change, enabling visualization of the complex pathways by which smallholders weave together livelihood and land use strategies within social and biophysical contexts that vary markedly within the study site. Data from household and parcel surveys were analyzed using SPSS. Tests included descriptive statistics, bi-variate comparison of means, bivariate correlation, Chi-Square, multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), and other multivariate regressions. Interviews were coded and analyzed qualitatively using ATLAS.ti software. An initial round of coding was done and refined into a codebook that was employed in a second round of coding, enabling sub-themes to emerge. The coding strategy reflected attempts to account for relationships deemed statistically robust as well as to further explain relationships that remained unclear following statistical analyses.</p>
