<p id="p0135" class="p">Fourth, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 male and 36 female respondents (April 2015 to August 2015) from randomly-selected households. Each of these 72 interviews involved three members of the research team: one asked questions in English, another translated between English and Kinyarwanda, and a third took detailed notes. Meetings immediately following each interview ensured that details and overall meaning were accurately recorded. Interviews averaged 1 h 20 min and concentrated on changes in climate, land use, livelihoods, household agricultural labor, agricultural challenges, and perceptions and impacts of government policies. Fifth, unstructured interviews were conducted (October 2014 to December 2016) with 32 individuals representing key institutions involved in agro-ecosystem management, including leaders in six umudugudu, five mayors at ‘cell’ and ‘sector’ levels, agronomists, state employees overseeing land tenure issues, cooperative presidents, input distribution companies, health workers, local development officers, and security officials, among others. Questions pertained to contemporary and historical political, economic, environmental, and agricultural aspects of the study area and broader region, including the implementation of Rwanda's CIP and perceptions of climate change.</p>
