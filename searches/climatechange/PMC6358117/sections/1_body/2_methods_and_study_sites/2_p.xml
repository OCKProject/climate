<p id="p0110" class="p">Empirical materials informing this study were collected via quantitative and qualitative methods carried out in Rwanda from September 2014 to December 2016. An in-depth case study was used to consider the interplay among smallholder livelihoods, land use practices, and development transitions in the context of climatic variability, uncertainty, and change. Surveys and interviews focused on smallholder resource access and decision-making within changing institutional contexts and broader social-environmental changes. Iterative phases of data collection enabled the research team to build and test hypotheses and to periodically solicit feedback from study participants. As demonstrated by other studies, empirical attention to lived experiences with climatic shocks and adaptation to perceived climate change can yield valuable insight on response pathways in the face of current and future global climate change (
