<p id="Par49" class="p">The prevalence of HIV/AIDS varied significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) across HM subtypes, as follows: The highest rate was in MM (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8/14), intermediate rates were in 2/5 of ALL, and rates of 2/6 were found in CML. The lowest rates of HIV/AIDS were 3/18 for AML, 1/10 for MDS and 2/42 for normal myelogram. The trends of incident HM peaked in El Nino 2009 and the lowest incidence was seen in La Nina 2014. The peak incidence of HM was observed between June to August, the very dry season. The majority of patients with HM were diagnosed during the dry and cold season. However, there was no significant difference in HM incidence by global climate variability.
