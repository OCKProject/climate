<p id="Par44" class="p">In a univariate analysis, continuous variables were symmetrical and expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD), compared between two groups (HM and patients with anaemia but having a normal myelogram) using the Student’s t-test. However, categorical variables were presented as frequencies (n = number) and prevalence (%), comparing the two groups using the chi-square test. The researchers performed logistic regression and the Cox regression model to calculate adjusted multivariate hazard ratios (HR = beta exponential) for the risk of incident HM with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Kaplan-Meir curves after the Cox regression model produced a one minus cumulative survival function with a log-rank test of the equality of survival distribution and time medians for the different levels of stratified covariates.</p>
