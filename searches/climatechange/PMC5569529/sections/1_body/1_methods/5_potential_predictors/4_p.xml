<p id="Par39" class="p">Local climates and seasons were defined by meteorological parameters (monthly temperatures, humidity, winds, fog, and precipitation). The dry season (very dry for June to September and less dry for January to March), cold months and rainy periods (high rainfall for October to December, lower rainfall for April and May) characterized the local climate. The interaction between global climate variability and local climate typically followed the pattern of: local dry season + global La Nina; local dry season + global El Nino; local rainy season + global La Nina; and local rainy season + global El Nino.</p>
