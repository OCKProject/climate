<p id="Par35" class="p">To define structural (morphological) markers for diagnosing HM, 3.5 ml of blood were obtained by venepuncture in tubes with anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for the hemogram. In addition, three smears of peripheral blood were performed. A sample taken from a tube with 3.8% citrate was used for the determination of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The bone marrow aspiration was performed either at the level of the breastbone or at the level of the posterior iliac spine to collect 0.5 ml of medullary content. Ten slides were displayed for the morphological study using the May Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) stains and for the special stains (Sudan black B, Periodic Acid Shift, Coloring of Perls). Medullary smears were also obtained for colored staining using the MGG viewed under the multi-ordinary microscope typical of Olympus.</p>
