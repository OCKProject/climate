<p id="Par57" class="p">In this study using multivariate Cox’s regression analysis, only exposure to pollution, combined local dry season + global La Nina climate variability, combined local dry season + global El Nino climate variability, and age ≥ 50 years were identified as the most significant and independent predictors of HM-incidence among anaemic black Central Africans. Climate change leads to over-exposure to ultraviolet rays and lower levels of vitamin D, resulting in decreased levels of immunity. In addition, chronic exposure to benzene products, lead and mercury in the environment increases the risk of HM. Climate change, environmental pollution, aging and anaemic hypoxia are associated with an imbalance in the anti-oxidant/oxidant state (oxidative stress), which increases the risk of HM incidence [
