Therefore, univariate analysis and a multivariate Coxâ€™s regression model were used to understand the pathophysiology and the environmental epidemiology (ecology) of HM incidence in a prospective cohort for anaemic patients managed at KUC. The present findings defined potential predictors and biomarkers as well as risk factors of incident HM.</p>
