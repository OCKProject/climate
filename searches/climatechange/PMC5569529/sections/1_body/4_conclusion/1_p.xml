<p id="Par61" class="p">These findings highlight the importance of HIV/AIDS, aging, environmental pollutions, the dry season, El Nino and La Nina as related to global warming as determinants of incident hematologic malignancies among black anaemic patients in Kinshasa, DR Congo. While significant findings have been documented on the HV/AIDS epidemic, concerted efforts of individuals, government and donor agencies are needed to address environmental pollution in Kinshasa and DRC in view of the current findings. Global leaders should be encouraged to double their efforts on global warming for the overall benefit of mankind and specifically to reduce the scourge of incident HM and other malignancies. Cancer registries in DRC and other African countries will provide more robust database for future researches on haematological malignancies in the light of the findings of this study.</p>
