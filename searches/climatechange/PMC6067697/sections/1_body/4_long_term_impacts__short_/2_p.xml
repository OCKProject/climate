<p class="p">Practical adaptation measures need to focus on what can be accomplished today with available and reliable climate information while keeping the long term in mind. For example, warming in Ethiopia is raising the maximum elevation for malaria transmission in mountainous areas, exposing new highland populations to malaria risk, but projected temperature trends are uncertain [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. A suitable adaptation response might use seasonal forecasts to advocate for new surveillance and clinics in marginal transmission zones, with higher vigilance during El Niño years when climate anomalies are more predictable [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and highland warming is often strongest [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Such windows of enhanced predictability can be used to push for malaria eradication, a priority of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication, by putting additional resources into control programs like bednet distribution, indoor residual spraying, and vector control at these times [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Approaches to decision-making under uncertainty are attracting attention and provide some promise for planners to incorporate uncertain future climate projections into planning decisions. Rather than a “predict then act” approach, they assess risks to policies [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These methods require deep consultation with stakeholders, considerable technical capacity, financial resources, and experience of facilitation. As yet, there are few practical examples in high-income countries and even fewer in low-income countries [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] although examples are now emerging, such as the implementation of a long-term water resources master plan in Lima, Peru [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Whilst flexibility can sometimes be built into long-term decisions—even in the case of sunk infrastructure projects [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]—more gradual adaptation options are also available, such as decisions to invest in monitoring and surveillance, reducing vulnerabilities, research, and capacity building [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
