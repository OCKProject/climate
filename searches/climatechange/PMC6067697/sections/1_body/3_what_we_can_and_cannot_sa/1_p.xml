<p class="p">Uncertainty in climate change prediction arises from multiple sources: (1) an imperfect ability to measure and initialize simulations with the current state of the climate system, atmospheric greenhouse gas, and aerosol concentrations (‘initial conditions’); (2) uncertainty about the anticipated future trajectory of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions; (3) climate model errors leading to uncertainty about how the climate system will respond to this external forcing; and (4) natural climate variability. To quantify the likelihood of different climate futures, multiple model simulations are run, which attempt to sample the range of prediction uncertainty arising from these different sources. These simulations assume different emissions trajectories, use a range of climate models, and are initialized using slightly perturbed initial conditions to see how each of these factors contributes to the total uncertainty. The spread of projected outcomes is taken as an indication of the uncertainty, and probabilities are assigned to outcomes according to how frequently they occur within the ensemble. The problem is that it is impossible to sample the full range of uncertainty within such an ensemble of projections [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Differences in projections among models are examined closely, but the ensemble of available models is ad hoc and cannot be expected to provide a reliable estimate of the range of futures that might plausibly occur. Moreover, without past test cases over which to calibrate the ensemble projections, it is impossible to know whether probabilistic climate change projections are reliable [
