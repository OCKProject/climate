<p class="p">These limitations pertain to projections of future climate change at any scale. Obtaining information at local scales and at specific points in the future gives rise to a number of additional issues, which are often overlooked in studies projecting future health impacts. Scientists have high confidence in several aspects of large-scale climate change, including, for example, global warming and large-scale temperature trends and sea level rise. However, the models have many documented limitations, particularly regarding their ability to capture extremes, which are often of most interest for impacts [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Projections among models can differ dramatically, especially on scales smaller than continents and even for the direction of change in rainfall in many parts of the world [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Downscaled climate information may appear to be a solution, as the output of this process delivers information that appears more realistic because of its higher resolution. However, regional downscaling cannot rectify many of the problems with global models and can give a false impression of confidence [
