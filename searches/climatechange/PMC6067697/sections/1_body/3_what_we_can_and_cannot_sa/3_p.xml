<p class="p">Of all the challenges associated with predicting climate change impacts, the natural variability of the climate system is perhaps the most overlooked. Unlike weather or seasonal forecasts, which are initialized with current weather and climate observations, climate change projections are uninitialized. The models are able to reproduce key modes of natural climate variability on interannual and decadal timescales, but without initialization, the timing of these cycles does not coincide with the real world. Initialised decadal predictions offer promise, but they are currently experimental and do not perform well enough to inform decision-making directly, particularly on local scales and for precipitation [

Interannual fluctuations are, overwhelmingly, the largest contributor to total climate variability for both rainfall and temperature. Decadal variability can be significant as well. For example, East Africa has experienced a decline in rainfall since the late 1990s despite long-term projections suggesting that the region is heading for wetter conditions by the end of the century [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002624.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The science behind global warming is unequivocal, but the expectation that the temperature will be hotter at the end of the century says nothing about the trajectory between now and the long-term future. Failure to consider these fluctuations could have major consequences for adaptation planning, particularly when looking at the next 10 to 30 years [
