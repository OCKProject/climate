 <p id="Par1" class="p">Tree-level intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) is derived from the tree-ring 
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C isotope composition (δ
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) and is an important indicator of the adaptability for trees to climate change. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the relationship between long-term forest ecosystem carbon sequestration capacity and iWUE. To determine whether elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (Ca) increase iWUE and tree growth (basal area increment, BAI), dendrochronological methods and stable isotope analyses were used to examine annual changes in the tree-ring width and carbon isotope composition (δ
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) of 
  <italic class="italic">Platycladus orientalis</italic> in northern China. The iWUE derived from δ
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C has increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01). Long-term iWUE trend was largely and positively driven by the elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature. We observed a general increase in averaged BAI, which had significant positive correlation with iWUE (R
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.3186, p &lt; 0.01). Increases in iWUE indeed translated into enhanced 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> growth in semi-arid areas of northern China. Elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration significantly (p &lt; 0.01) stimulated 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> biomass accumulation when Ca was less than approximately 320 ppm in the early phase; however, this effect was not pronounced when Ca exceeded 320 ppm.
