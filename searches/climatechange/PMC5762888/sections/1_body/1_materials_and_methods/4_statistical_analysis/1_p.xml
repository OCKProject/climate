<p id="Par16" class="p">To model tree growth, we measured all cores ring widths and calculated BAI of each tree and then averaged them. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the BAI variation among trees. We used pooled wood samples, mixing material of the same cross-dated ring for measuring annual δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and then calculated iWUE. Regression analyses and t-test were used to identify significant trends in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, Δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C, iWUE, and BAI from 1880 to 2014, and to test the relationships between iWUE and BAI, between iWUE and environmental factors (include atmospheric CO
