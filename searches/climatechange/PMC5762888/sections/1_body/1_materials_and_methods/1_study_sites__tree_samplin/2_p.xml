 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> trees that were at least 90 years of age were selected for sampling. Two or three cores were taken from each tree at breast height (1.3 m) from different sections of the stem using a 5-mm increment borer (a total of 92 cores were collected). To prevent contamination from other carbon sources, the collected samples were stored in glass tubes.
