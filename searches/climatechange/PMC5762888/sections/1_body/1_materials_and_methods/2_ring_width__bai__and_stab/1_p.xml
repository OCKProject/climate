<p id="Par7" class="p">The core samples were sanded with grain paper that varied from 100 to 800 mesh to make the tree-ring more clearly visible for cross-dating. Then, COFECHA was used to check dating, find errors in the individual series, and improve the cross-dating accuracy

 </sup>. Eight of the cores had rotted or had been damaged by woodworms, and 11 of the cores were missing rings, which would cause inaccuracies in the test data. Cores with poor quality were excluded from analysis. Thus, only 71 cores were selected for analysis, and these were divided into two sections: 35 cores were used for width measurements, and the remaining 36 cores were used to evaluate stable carbon isotopes. After natural drying, fixation, and grinding, tree ring widths were measured at a resolution of 0.01â€‰mm from each of the cores using LINTAB 6 measurement equipment (Frank Rinn, Heidelberg, Germany) and the data were analyzed using Time Series Analysis and Presentation (TSAP) software package (Frank Rinn, Heidelberg, Germany). Cross-dating of the tree-ring data was verified using COFECHA, which assesses the quality of cross-dating and the measurement accuracy of tree-ring series using a segmented time-series correlation technique
