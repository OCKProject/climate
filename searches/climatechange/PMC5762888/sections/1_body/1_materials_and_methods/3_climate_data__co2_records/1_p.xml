<p id="Par15" class="p">All weather data were obtained from the Miyun National Forest Farm Meteorological Station (117°07′E, 40°22′N) located at 352 m a.s.l., 5 km from the study area. The data were checked for quality and consistency, and included the annual minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures, as well as annual precipitation, from 1951 to 2014. As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows, mean annual temperatures in the study area ranged from 10.45 °C to 14.02 °C, with an average temperature of 12.2 °C, and there was an increasing trend of 0.039 °C per year during the study period. A similar trend was seen for the minimum annual temperatures and no obvious change was observed in maximum temperature. Annual precipitation exhibited a slight decrease over the study period (−3.4625 mm per year), and differed significantly among calendar years, ranging from 261.4 mm to 1404.6 mm.
