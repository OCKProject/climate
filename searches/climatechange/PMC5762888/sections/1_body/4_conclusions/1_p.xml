<p id="Par29" class="p">Global climate change has had significant impacts on forest ecosystem function worldwide, and these effects vary across regions. Understanding the responses of iWUE and tree growth to climate change has great importance for predicting how plants may respond to climate variations in the future and its implications for forest management and conservation. In our study, we detected a significantly increasing trend in iWUE curves (p &lt; 0.01) and a significant positive correlation between iWUE and BAI (p &lt; 0.01). Long-term iWUE trend could be largely and positively driven by the elevated CO

Then the promotion effect were not pronounced when Ca was above 320 ppm. There was not a decrease in the growth of drought-tolerant conifers in northern China, suggesting that growth of
