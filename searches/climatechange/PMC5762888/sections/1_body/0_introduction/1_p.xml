 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mole fraction in the atmosphere has increased from 280 to 380 µmol mol

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. Tree-level intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) is estimated as the ratio of net photosynthetic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation (A) to stomatal conductance (g
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>). iWUE is an important component of water-carbon coupling and process management in terrestrial ecosystems
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the environment increases
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>, which affects the gradient between atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Ca) and internal leaf CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Ci), and in turn determines the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C isotope composition (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) of assimilated carbon
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. The “Suess effect” refers to a change in the ratio of the atmospheric concentrations of heavy isotopes of carbon (
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C), resulting from the admixture of large amounts of fossil-fuel derived CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which is depleted in 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. During carbon fixation, fractionation associated with physical and enzymatic processes causes plant matter to become 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-depleted in comparison with the air. To distinguish variations in the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C of source CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the effects of plant metabolic processes, the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C signatures of plant organic material are usually translated to carbon isotope discrimination (Δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C), and Δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C is related to the ratio of Ci to Ca during photosynthesis in C3 plants
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, any variability in the iWUE is recorded in the carbon isotopes of tree tissues. Because carbon builds up in tissues over time, the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values do not represent the iWUE in a given instant but rather the average iWUE during the formation of tree-tissue organic matter.
