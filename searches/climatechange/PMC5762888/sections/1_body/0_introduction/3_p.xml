The specific goals of the study were to (1) determine whether tree-level iWUE increased over time (i.e., across subsequent calendar years) and whether that translated into tree growth and (2) assess how iWUE and tree growth (as measured by the basal area increment [BAI]) responded to changes in atmospheric CO
