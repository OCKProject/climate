<p id="Par3" class="p">Many studies have shown that rising atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations can speed up tree growth by stimulating photosynthesis in a process known as “CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization”; however most of these studies were conducted over short time periods in growth chambers with seedlings or young plants

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration will require additional N and other nutrients, and the production response will therefore decline as nutrient limitation progresses. Results derived from short-term experiments may not represent longer-term responses of plants to multiple factors in the natural environment
