<p id="Par26" class="p">In addition, there was no clear response of the iWUE to changes in precipitation. In the rocky mountainous area of northern China, precipitation mainly causes increases in runoff with some percolation through the soil. Changes in precipitation typically affect plant growth conditions by altering the soil moisture content

 </sup>. There were no significant changes in precipitation during the study period and only a slight decrease was observed after the year 2000. In any case, the inter-annual variability of rainfall is very high, and we did not found any relationship between annual precipitation and iWUE or BAI. It seems that
