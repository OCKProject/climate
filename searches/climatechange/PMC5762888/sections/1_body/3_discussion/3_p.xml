<p id="Par24" class="p">Following the second industrial revolution, atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations have gradually increased, rising from 276.1 ppm to 397.6 ppm in northern China according to the China Global Atmosphere Watch Baseline Observatory. We found that the iWUE increased significantly under elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations. Our findings are consistent with other studies conducted on the effects of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on leaf physiological activity, which demonstrating that increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> promotes WUE (determined by traditional measurement methods: weighing, gas exchange, etc.)
