 </sup> found that since 1800, tree radial growth was not always associated with increased iWUE in the Xinglong Mountains of northwestern China; in fact, tree growth rates declined during periods of drought and particularly in the past decade. These results suggested that increases in iWUE are unable to compensate for the negative effects of severe limitations on tree radial growth.
