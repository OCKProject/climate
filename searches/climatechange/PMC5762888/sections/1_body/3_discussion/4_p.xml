<p id="Par25" class="p">In this study, we used the averaged BAI to characterize trees growth. Then we did the ANOVA between averaged BAI and each tree’s BAI, a total of 35 pairs of data series, found that the 77.1% pairs had no significant difference. Thus the variation among trees could be ignored and averaged BAI could represent most trees growth in this region. The averaged BAI showed a significant increasing tendency (p &lt; 0.01); however, the coefficient of determination between BAI and iWUE was relatively low (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.3299), and there was still some difference values between before and after the 1970s. The BAI increased significantly before the 1970s and then fluctuated but did not increase significantly. It seems that there is a limitation beyond which the increase of BAI would abate. Some scholars found that when atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration exceeds approximately 350 ppm, the BAI decreased with increasing atmospheric CO

 </sup>. In this study, we found that the tipping point of the concentration for the BAI response curve was approximately 320 ppm. Thus, there is a contrast between the results of short-term experiments and long-term studies. A notable difference is nitrogen availability, which may positively stimulate leaf area, photosynthesis, and plant growth
