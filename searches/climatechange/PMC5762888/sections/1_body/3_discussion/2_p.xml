 </sup>. This phenomenon can be explained by plant ecophysiology. First, when plants are subjected to high temperatures their stomata partially close, and then g
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> decreases to prevent an excessive loss of water, thereby reducing the internal CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of the leaves. The absorption and utilization rate of internal leaf CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase to maintain high photosynthetic rate (An). At the same time, an increase in temperature causes an increase in the vapor-pressure deficit and in the transpiration rate (Tr); accordingly, iWUE and temperature were positively related in this study. The number of days for which the daily maximum temperature was higher than 30 °C increased substantially in the study area each year, together with the frequency of extreme temperature values, leading to reduced stomatal conductance and altering the environmental and physiological functions of
