<p id="Par28" class="p">In contrast with other studies, we found evidence for long-term increases in BAI that were associated with increases in iWUE. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> growth increased as iWUE increased in the mountainous area of northern China due to drought tolerance and high temperature resistance. In addition, the long-term water use efficiency of the

 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> forest ecosystem increased under elevated CO

This is mainly because of the special leaf structure, i.e., photosynthetic limitation by mesophyll diffusion varies strongly with the leaf structure

 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>, which have a structure that enables them to adapt to water limitations
