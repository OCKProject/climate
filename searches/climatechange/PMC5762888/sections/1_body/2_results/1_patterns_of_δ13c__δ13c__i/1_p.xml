 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> and cellulose δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> trends under decreased stable atmospheric carbon isotopes (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) (“Suess effect”) from 1880 to 2014. The t-test revealed that a significant difference between δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>, implying that δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> cannot be replaced by δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">w</sub>. We detected a decreased trend in both δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>Cc curves. The δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> pattern could be divided into approximately three periods, i.e., two plateau periods from 1880 to 1917 and from 1975 to 2014 and one decreasing period from 1918 to 1974. The δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> declined from 1918 to 1974 and exhibited considerable fluctuation during that time, and both the maximum (−21.57‰, 1918) and minimum (−23.97‰, 1962) values were detected in that period. By comparison, there was no clear trend in the other two periods, during which time the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> curve was relatively stable.
