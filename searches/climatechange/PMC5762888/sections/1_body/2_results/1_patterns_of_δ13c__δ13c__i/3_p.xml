 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Tree-ring width increased initially (from 1880 to 1961) and then decreased from 1962 to 2001, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Since 2002, there has been a slight increase in tree-ring width. The averaged BAI showed a significant quadratic curve increase from 1880 to 2014 (R
