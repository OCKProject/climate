<p id="Par18" class="p">iWUE increased significantly, particularly since 1974, with changes in the Ci and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), while the discrimination (Δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) trends exhibited the opposite pattern (a decrease). There was a significant increase in iWUE, at a rate of 0.49 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per year, throughout the last century (p &lt; 0.05). iWUE ranged from 82.35 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (1920) to 138.12 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (2014) during the study period, and a significant increase was detected from 1974 to 2014, at a rate of 1.1 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per year. Higher Ci values were associated with lower discrimination (Δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) and higher iWUE.
