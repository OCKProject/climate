  <title class="title">Classification of velocity and minimum cumulative exposure.</title>
  <p class="p">The relationship between velocity
   <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and minimum cumulative exposure (MCE) for a random sample of 5000 pixels from North America is presented in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>. Velocity
   <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE values&gt;0 are plotted on log-log axis. MCE values=0 (71% of pixels) are plotted in lower panel and are considered low; MCE&gt;0 are considered high. The dashed vertical line represents the median velocity
   <sub class="sub">MED</sub> which is used to delineate between low and high velocity classes. Map showing the distribution of the four classes based on the bivariate distribution of MCE and velocity
   <sub class="sub">MED</sub> is presented in 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>. Dot colour in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> corresponds to map color in 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>. Areas in grey represent pixels whose source or destination pixel is located on an island (see Methods section).
