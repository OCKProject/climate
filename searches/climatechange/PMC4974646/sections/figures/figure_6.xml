  <p class="p">Illustration of how final cost surfaces were generated for two temperature increments (5.0 and 5.5 °C) and two examples of climate trajectories for the interval between 1995 and 2085. To account for changing temperature fields through time, we produced intermediate cost surfaces between the start and end years (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>). Here we show a single intermediate temperature field for simplicity; however our analysis utilized 31 intermediate temperature surfaces which were linearly interpolated between 1995 and 2085. Cost surfaces were generated based on

   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and 5.5 °C isotherm (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) (see Methods section). For each pixel, the minimum cost over all time periods is retained for the final cost surface (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>), which is then used to generate climate trajectories using a least-cost algorithm (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>). Note that the example climate trajectories have the lowest accumulated cost compared to any other potential trajectories. This approach accounts for a changing climate by allowing trajectories to follow the climate as it warms. Cost surfaces were generated in this fashion for each 0.1 °C increment (
