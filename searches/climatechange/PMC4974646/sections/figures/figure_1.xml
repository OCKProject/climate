  <title class="title">Climate trajectories and minimum cumulative exposure.</title>
  <p class="p">Climate trajectories are defined by a source pixel (start) with a given temperature under current conditions (1981–2010) and a destination pixel (end) with a similar temperature under future conditions (2071–2100). An example of the difference between climate trajectories defined by Euclidean distance (ED) and minimum exposure distance (MED) for a site within North America (inset) is presented in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>. MED (solid line) minimizes exposure to climates that are dissimilar to that of the source pixel whereas ED (dashed line) minimizes distance travelled. An example of minimum cumulative exposure (MCE) for two trajectories is presented in 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>. Although the trajectories are similar in length, MCE=0 for path 1 because the trajectory tracks changes in climate over the study period without traversing temperatures that are dissimilar to that of the source pixel. Path 2 has a high MCE because the trajectory traverses two warm valleys (shading).
