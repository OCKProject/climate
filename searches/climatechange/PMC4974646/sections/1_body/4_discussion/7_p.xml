<p class="p">Climate velocity estimates (whether based on MED or ED) for montane regions suggest limited exposure and relatively short migration paths under climate change. However, we show that distance (and velocity) is an imperfect measure of climate connectivity given that it does not account for spatial variability in climatic resistance to movement (that is, MCE). MCE can be high in mountainous regions, which implies that these areas are more climatically isolated than has been previously reported. Conversely, flat regions of the continent have high velocities but negligible climatic resistance to movement. These regions may have greater climatic connectivity to their future climate analogues than is currently appreciated. Consequently, a more nuanced assessment of climate exposure is warranted, one which explicitly accounts for climatic resistance to movement. Hence, we advocate for further integration between â€˜climate informed' connectivity modelling approaches and the development of climate change exposure metrics. This integration will more realistically describe multiple facets of exposure to biota from ongoing climate change.</p>
