<p class="p">Climate trajectories based on ED and MED define two end-members of a spectrum of potential trajectories that are contingent on a sites' physiographic setting and the traits of species that occupy the site. In flat regions, for example, there is little difference between these end-members; velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> show similar values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> diverge most notably in areas of complex terrain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref>). Furthermore, MCE represents the minimum exposure to dissimilar climate along a potential migration path. The actual climate change exposure of individual organisms will also depend on the traits of the species that occupy the site
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Vagile organisms may be able to keep pace with large climate velocities, whereas sessile organisms may fall behind changing climate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, resulting in increased exposure as climate change outpaces movements. Moreover, dispersal traits of organisms will likely affect migration routes. For example, volant species such as birds may follow straight line paths that are well approximated by velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub>. Thermal tolerances may also influence whether an organism tends to follow straight line paths or paths that minimize exposure to dissimilar climates. For instance, thermal specialists (for example, ectotherms from the tropics;) are more likely to minimize their exposure to dissimilar climate (approximated by velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>) as compared with thermal generalists (for example, endotherms from high latitudes)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Similarly, the narrow reproductive niche

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> of many plant species will likely require longer migratory paths than those described using velocity
