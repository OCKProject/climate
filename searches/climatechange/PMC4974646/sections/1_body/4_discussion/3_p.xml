<p class="p">The bivariate distribution of velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE provides a logical framework for assessing exposure as a function of species dispersal capacity and thermal tolerance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). We present a simple classification of the bivariate distribution of velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE as four groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>): low velocity, low MCE; low velocity, high MCE; high velocity, low MCE; and high velocity, high MCE. We use the terms low and high to simply qualify the range of our data and do not suggest that the specific thresholds we use (see methods) have biological relevance. Nevertheless, areas with high velocity present increased risk of exposure to poorly dispersing species. Areas of high MCE present increased risk for thermal specialists. Of particular concern are areas with both high velocity and MCE (for example, mountain tops, peninsulas). These areas are climatically isolated and increase the vulnerability of local populations to climate change. Specific examples include the Great Lakes, Yucatan Moist Forests, and the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregions (
