<p class="p">Velocity and MCE describe complementary facets of exposure: the length of potential migration paths and climatic resistance to movement along these paths through time. Our estimates of velocity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. However, this interpretation assumes climatic resistance to movement does not vary in space. We show that in areas of complex terrain (for example, the cordillera of North America), MCE can be high even for short climate trajectories because they often traverse climatically heterogeneous landscapes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">3</xref>). In this context, spatial climate heterogeneity acts to increase resistance to movement, thus reducing climatic connectivity between a source and destination pixel. In contrast, long climate trajectories over much of the continent pass through climatically homogenous environments with little to no resistance. Under these conditions, velocity is large but MCE is zero (that is, much of the Great Plains and Canadian Boreal region;
