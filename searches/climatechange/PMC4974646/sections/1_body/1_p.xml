 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Climatic connectivity—the ability of a landscape to promote or hinder species movement in response to a changing climate—is also contingent on the costs of moving through areas of dissimilar climate. These costs may preclude migration in areas with strong climate gradients. For instance, the closest climate analogue for a mountain-top may be found on an adjacent mountain-top. The distance may be short between each point, but the actual exposure to climate differences along the trajectory through the ensuing valley can be large (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> to estimating velocity assume that organisms will minimize the distance they travel (Euclidean distance—ED) as opposed to minimizing their exposure to dissimilar climate. If organisms minimize exposure and thus deviate from straight line paths, then velocity based on ED (velocity
