<p class="p">Here we propose a set of modifications for distance-based velocity based on the assumption that organisms will follow paths that minimize their exposure to dissimilar climates. The distance along this trajectory from source to destination pixel (minimum exposure distance; MED) will be greater than or equal to distances calculated using ED. To account for this assumption, we employ least-cost modelling techniques (see Methods section) applied to isotherms within North America (

 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> with velocity estimates based on MED (velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>). In addition, we quantify the minimum cumulative exposure (MCE) in °C along each climate trajectory which to our knowledge, is a previously unreported facet of exposure. We find that velocity is weakly related to MCE; both velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> and velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> underestimate exposure in mountainous regions where even short climate trajectories traverse landscapes with dissimilar climate resulting in high values of MCE. In contrast, velocity is high over flat regions of the continent where MCE is low, as these areas have negligible climatic resistance to movement.
