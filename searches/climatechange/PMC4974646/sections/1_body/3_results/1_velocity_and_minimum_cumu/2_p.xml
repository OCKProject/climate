<p class="p">There is considerable regional variability in velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE (summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) driven by the rate of temperature change, regional landforms, proximity to water and local physiography. Velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> tended to increase with latitude due to greater projected warming, was lower in areas of complex terrain, and was higher in flat areas and regions surrounded by large water bodies such as the Great Lakes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, MCE values were generally 0 in flat regions with high velocities (the Great Plains and Boreal region) and were often &gt;0 in topographically complex areas along the major mountain cordillera of the continent (areas with generally low velocity; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Areas with large MCE values often had climate trajectories that required southward movements (for example, northward oriented peninsulas) or traversed relatively warm valleys (mountainous regions; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The ratio between velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> was also higher in mountainous regions and on northward oriented peninsulas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE are only weakly correlated (Spearman's rank 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.37); for MCE values &gt;0 this correlation increases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.81), although there is substantial variation in velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> across all MCE values (
