<p class="p">For North America, the average (geometric mean) climate velocity based on MED (velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>) was 3.25 km per year (5–95th percentile; 0.28–30.9 km per year). In comparison, average velocity based on ED (velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub>) was 2.68 km per year (0.24–11.8 km per year), which indicates that velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> is 21% higher on average than velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub>. The location of the ‘nearest' climate analogue varies depending on whether we assume organisms minimize exposure to dissimilar climates or minimize distance travelled; 37% of source pixels had different destination locations when comparing the MED and ED approaches; of these pixels, the locations differed on average (geometric mean) by 236 km. MCE values were strongly right skewed; 71% of the continent exhibited no exposure (MCE=0) despite having widely varying velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>. For cells in which MCE&gt;0, the median value was 147 °C (3.0–8,005 °C). In addition to the results presented herein, which are based on gridded temperature data at 5 km resolution, we also assessed the sensitivity of velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>, velocity
 <sub class="sub">ED</sub> and MCE to the resolution of input climate data, the width of temperature bins for defining a climate analogue, and cost penalties associated with the resistance surfaces used in least-cost modelling (see Methods section,
