<p class="p">We generated estimates of velocity and MCE over the interval (1981–2010) and (2071–2100) using mean annual temperature data described by (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>). Projections of future mean annual temperature are based on an ensemble of 15 CMIP5 GCMs under the RCP 8.5 scenario. These data came rounded to the tenth of a degree and had an original spatial resolution of 1 km, which we resampled to a 5 km resolution.
