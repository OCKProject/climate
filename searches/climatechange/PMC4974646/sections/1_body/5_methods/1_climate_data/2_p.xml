<p class="p">For each 5 km pixel in North America, we identified all pixels with a climate analogue in the future time period. We define the climate analogue as any pixel that is ±0.25 °C from the pixel of interest, effectively setting a bin width of 0.5 °C. We then used a least-cost algorithm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> to identify the trajectory (potential migration routes) that minimizes exposure to dissimilar climates between each source and destination pixel with a matching future climate analogue. We developed cost surfaces (one for each 0.1 °C temperature increment) in a manner that accounts for spatio-temporal changes in climate, allowing isotherms to be traced over landscapes and through time.
