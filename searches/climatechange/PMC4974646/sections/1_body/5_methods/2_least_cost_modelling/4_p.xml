<p class="p">Accounting for temporal changes in climate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6aâ€“d</xref>) was necessary for two reasons. First, had we based our cost surface on the mean annual temperature in one time period (for example, 1995), trajectories would reflect the minimum exposure in that time period only and would not reflect the optimum path based on a changing climate. The second reason is one of accounting: MCE would always be &gt;0 if we did not base the final cost surfaces on the interpolated temperature grids. For example, had we based cost on the mean annual temperature in 1995, the cost associated with the destination location, which by definition is a climate analogue and should have a cost equal to one (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" class="xref">equation 1</xref>), would be high because the cost would reflect 1995 climate and not 2085 climate (compare top and bottom panels in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). Consequently, our approach accounts for a changing climate by allowing trajectories to follow the climate as it warms and acknowledges that paths between source and destination locations with no intervening topographic variation should not traverse dissimilar climates and will have an MCE=0 (for example, simple northward migration in flat terrain).
