<p class="p">The overall workflow for our approach to least-cost modelling is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>. To account for a changing climate, we first interpolated mean annual temperature grids to represent incremental changes in temperature over the 90 year time period. These interpolated temperature grids (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=31) represent mean annual temperature on about three year increments between the start (1995) and end date (2085) and assume a linear trend in changes in temperature over this time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6a</xref>). Next, we created intermediate cost surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6b,c</xref>) for each of these interpolated temperature grids such that costs were proportional to the level of dissimilarity between each 0.1 °C increment of interest (in 1995) and all other pixels based on the following equation:
