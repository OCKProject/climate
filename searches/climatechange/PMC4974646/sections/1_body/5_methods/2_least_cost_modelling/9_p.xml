 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6d</xref>), MED is the minimum exposure distance (which we subtract from total accumulated cost because it implicitly includes path distance; this is a result of assigning a value of 1 to all pixels with the same climate analogue; 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" class="xref">equation 1</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> is a climate dissimilarity penalty (as described in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" class="xref">equation 1</xref>). In summary, MCE is a cumulative tally of climate dissimilarities that were encountered along each path. For example, MCE=2.5 °C indicates that the path, regardless of its total length, traversed 5 km (that is, one pixel; the resolution of our climate data) that was ±0.5 °C from the pixel of interest; MCE=5.0 °C indicates that the path, regardless of its length, traversed 10 km (that is, two pixels) that was ±0.5 °C from the pixel of interest OR traversed 5 km (one pixel) that was ±1.0 °C from the pixel of interest. For comparative purposes, we also identified the ED nearest neighbour and ED-based velocity (cf., ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>) using the same climate analogue and binning approach described above.
