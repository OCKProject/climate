<p class="p">For each source pixel in each temperature increment, we used the costDistance function of the gdistance package
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref> in the R statistical environment to calculate the accumulated cost to all pixels with the corresponding future climate analogue. We then identified the destination pixel with the least-accumulated cost and used the shortestPath function of the gdistance package to delineate the trajectory from source to destination pixel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6e</xref>). By definition, trajectories delineated with these methods minimize exposure to dissimilar climates (as defined by our cost surfaces) and the length (km) of these trajectories is termed the MED. We subsequently calculated velocity
