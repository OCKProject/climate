<p class="p">To help visualize spatial patterns in exposure, we classified pixels within North America using a simple four-category scheme based on the bivariate distribution of velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub> and MCE. Given that 71% of the MCE values were 0, we chose MCE&gt;0 to delineate ‘high' values and MCE=0 to delineate ‘low' values. For velocity
 <sub class="sub">MED</sub>, we used the median as the boundary between ‘high' and ‘low' values.
