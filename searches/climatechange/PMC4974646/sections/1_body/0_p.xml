<p class="p">Climate change impacts on biota depend in part on climate change exposure, the degree to which a system is exposed to climate variations over time or space
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. One of the most widely used metrics for estimating exposure is climate change velocity, the direction and rate at which organisms must move to maintain a given climate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Multiple formulations have been proposed for calculating climate velocity, including approaches based on local climate gradients
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> (herein gradient based) and those based on distance to analogue climates (distance based)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. These metrics have been used to describe risk of species extinctions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>, climate change responses of marine taxa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>, regional patterns in species endemism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, Quaternary range shifts of biota
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, the distribution of climate change refugia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> and climate change exposure under observed and projected future conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Velocity has also been used to derive climate trajectories, paths that describe the movement of a climate isopleth over a given period of time
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. Although velocity estimates are dependent on a number of methodological choices
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, the relative rankings of velocity have been shown to be quite robust to differences in methodology
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> and show a general pattern of low values (implying longer climate residence times) in regions with high spatial climate heterogeneity (for example, mountainous regions), and high velocity (shorter residence times) in areas of low topographic relief
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Consequently, authors have suggested that flat areas are particularly exposed to climate change while areas of complex terrain may act to buffer climate change impacts by allowing organisms to ameliorate climate shifts via short distance dispersal
