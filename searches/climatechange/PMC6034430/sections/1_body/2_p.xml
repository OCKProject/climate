<p id="p0020" class="p">The requirements for academic promotion and/or tenure for researchers have traditionally focused on publishing high-profile papers to which they have made a major contribution, which is generally denoted by “first” or “senior” authorship. Obtaining grant support is another important requirement for promotion, which, of course, is inextricably linked to publishing in high-impact journals. Unfortunately, translational science is a “square peg” that does not always fit nicely into the “round hole” of traditional academic models. First, translational science focuses on useful applications of basic science rather than on intellectual novelty. As noted by Ben A. Barres, Professor and Chair of Neurobiology at Stanford University School of Medicine: “Pure science is what you’re rewarded for. That’s what you get promoted for. That’s what they give the Nobel Prizes for. And yet developing a drug is a hundred times harder than getting a Nobel Prize”

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">(3)</xref> believe that “academia has turned publications into a currency they were never meant to be: a system of metrics to assess research, research programs.” Citations are imperfect and inconsistent measures of quality, particularly when compared across different scientific disciplines. Moreover, citation data for translational science are skewed, in that the initial scientific discovery and the report of the phase III studies are published in high-impact journals, and all of the other critical studies in between (discovery lead identification, pre-clinical studies, and phase 1 to 2 studies) are published in specialized journals that have lesser impact. As we have noted previously on these pages, one cannot get to phase III without going through phase I and II

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">(3)</xref> further comment that “by giving so much weight to the impact of publications, universities undervalue translational research, putting the careers of their staff in the hands of outsiders and even contributing to the flaws of the system of peer review. Indeed, the pressure to publish in high-impact journals is one of the drivers of poor reproducibility of scientific experimental outcomes” 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>. What academic medical centers will need to understand is that citation impact factor does not always correlate with the societal impact factor. Third, translational research requires team science, which means that critical members of the research team may often appear as middle authors in multiauthor papers. From my own personal experience sitting on promotion committees, explaining the critical importance of a middle author to the successful completion of a multidisciplinary/multiauthor research paper is a hard sell to the accomplished members of a promotion committee who have been weaned on the primacy of first or last authorship. Big science and team science are here to stay, now and for the foreseeable future. Academic medical centers will need to learn how to recognize and reward all of the members of the translational team for the species to survive.
