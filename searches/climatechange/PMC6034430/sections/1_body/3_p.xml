 <italic class="italic">How can academic medical centers avoid stranding their talented faculty in the translational valley of death?</italic> Recognizing that “all politics are local,” it would be incredibly presumptuous to suggest that there is single model that will work in all academic medical centers. That said, awareness of the importance of translational scientists is the first step. The good news is that academic medical centers are aware that translational research is a distinct discipline that provides a critical bridge between the bench and the bedside. None of the problems discussed in the preceding text are insurmountable; however, each of them will require a “climate change” within academic medical centers with respect to the manner in which the qualifications of translational scientists are assessed. Unfortunately, the bad news is that most academic medical centers have not yet recognized the need to develop qualitative tools for recognizing, rewarding, and retaining translational investigators. The academic climate for translational researchers must change today if we are to avoid adding translational scientists to the endangered species list. Many students make their career choices early on in their training. If they don’t see a clear path across the translational valley of death, they will opt out for a different career path. Inattention today runs the risk of extinction tomorrow, and extinction is simply not an option giving the rising burden of cardiovascular disease worldwide. In the second annual National Institutes of Health Shannon Lecture in 1999, Dr. Leon R. Rosenberg commented on the importance of maintaining the pool of physician-scientists. His words were remarkably prescient and ring true in 2017 with respect to MD, MD/PhD, or PhDs who engage in translational research: “We must act now to create a national environment conducive to creating a new generation of physician-scientists—rigorous in their training, confident in their ability to compete and succeed, and, above all, imbued with the belief that their efforts are essential if we are to improve the lives of people everywhere—young and old, woman and man, sick and well”
