<p id="p0015" class="p">Over the past 30 years, the cardiovascular disciplines of basic and clinical research have emerged as distinct scientific entities, with distinct training and career pathways. These disciplines have journalistic homes, separate meetings, and well-delineated support mechanisms through funding agencies, such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, American Heart Association, and not-for-profit organizations. Unfortunately, as these scientific disciplines have matured, they have grown farther apart, which has made it increasingly hard for scientists in each field to communicate and learn from one other another. For many years, the pharmaceutical industry was able to serve as an effective bridge for the divide between these 2 disciplines; however, with the increasing expense of phase III trials required to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval of news drugs and/or devices, and the increasing number of drug/device failures in phase III, it has become harder for the pharmaceutical industry to serve as an effective bridge between the basic and clinical sciences. The widening intellectual chasm that has emerged between basic and clinical science has been referred to as the valley of death

Although the National Institutes of Health’s efforts, started under Director Elias Zerhouni’s “roadmap initiative,” have begun to yield dividends in terms of bridging this chasm, and academic medical centers have stepped up by developing new training programs in clinical and translational science that are designed to engage MD, PhD, and MD/PhDs, none of these efforts have, heretofore, addressed the important issue of how to recognize and reward the contributions of translational investigators who work within academic medical centers.
