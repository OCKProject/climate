<p class="p">Materials were designed to be poster-sized. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> summarizes content and design features of the posters. A panel at the bottom of each poster provided lists of what individuals can do to protect their health from the specific condition (“Healthy You”), individual actions toward climate change mitigation such as walking, biking or taking public transit instead of driving (“Healthy Places”), and what respondents could do to engage in collective action for climate change mitigation, such as supporting policies to limit carbon pollution or support clean energy (“Healthy Planet”).
