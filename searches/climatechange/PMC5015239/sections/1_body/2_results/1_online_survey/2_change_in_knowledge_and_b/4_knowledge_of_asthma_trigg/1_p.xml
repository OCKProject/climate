<p class="p">Knowledge of environmental exposures that trigger asthma attacks was high at the beginning of the survey (over half of the sample had a household member, including themselves, who suffered from asthma), but did not significantly improve (and for some items, declined slightly) after viewing the study materials. Although smoke was identified in the asthma study materials as a trigger, fewer respondents correctly identified it after viewing the study materials (93.1 % [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 108] at pre-test, 86.2 % [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 100] at post-test) the majority of respondents correctly identified pollen at pre-test (81.9 %, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 95) and post-test (78.4 %, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 91). Pet dander was identified by less than half the sample (46.6 % at pre-test [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 54], 41.4 % at post-test [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 48]) as a trigger. Three-quarters of the sample correctly identified air pollution (or smog) as an asthma trigger before (76.7 %, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 89) and after (78.4 %, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 91) viewing the study materials. Significantly fewer respondents chose the incorrect response option (“certain foods, such as peanuts”) after viewing the study materials (42.2 % at pre-test [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 49], 29.5 % at post-test [
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 31]; McNemar’s
