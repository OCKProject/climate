<p class="p">Knowledge of environmental triggers for allergy sufferers improved significantly for abstract concepts related to plant growth and allergen production (heat, carbon dioxide) after viewing the study materials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). At pre-test, 52.6 % of respondents (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 61) identified heat as a contributor to worsening allergies; 69.8 % (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 81) selected heat at post-test. At pre-test, only 38.8 % of respondents (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 45) identified carbon dioxide as a contributor to allergies, 56.9 % (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 66) did so at post-test. The increases were statistically significant for heat (McNemar’s

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 9.52, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003) and carbon dioxide (McNemar’s

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 12.60, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Respondents were largely aware of other pollen allergy triggers before viewing the study materials, and these levels were sustained (92.2 % [
