Health communication can provide information on the management of these impacts. This study tested, among vulnerable audiences, whether viewing targeted materials increases knowledge about the health impacts of climate change and strength of climate change beliefs, and whether each are associated with stronger intentions to practice recommended behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Low-SES respondents with chronic conditions were recruited for an online survey in six cities. Respondents were shown targeted materials illustrating the relationship between climate change and chronic conditions. Changes in knowledge and climate change beliefs (pre- and post-test) and behavioral intentions (post-test only) were tested using McNemar tests of marginal frequencies of two binary outcomes or paired t-tests, and multivariable linear regression. Qualitative interviews were conducted among target audiences to triangulate survey findings and make recommendations on the design of messages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Respondents (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;122) reflected the target population regarding income, educational level and prevalence of household health conditions. (1) Knowledge.

Environmental conditions that will contribute to greater human morbidity and mortality from climate change include increases in air pollution, intense storms and extreme heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Greater levels of particulate air pollution and ground-level ozone exacerbate respiratory conditions, resulting in increased hospital admissions, emergency room visits and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Climate change will increase pollen production because of more frost-free days, warmer seasonal temperatures and longer growing seasons due to an abundance of carbon dioxide, and the resulting pollen from allergenic plant species contributes to allergies and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Extreme heat contributes to hospital admissions and death for those with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Chronic disease can limit mobility during extreme weather events, and extreme weather disrupts access to routine medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Populations that are especially vulnerable to these health impacts include those with chronic health conditions, low socioeconomic status (SES), children, the elderly&#x000a0;and some racial/ethnic minority groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At-risk populations can have co-occurring vulnerabilities which increase risk for illness, injury or death from environmental conditions attributable to climate change, particularly if they are simultaneously lacking the financial, social or community resilience necessary to cope with or recover from additional stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous research demonstrates that messages designed to raise awareness of health risks from weather events can reduce morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations. These findings may be applicable to the extreme weather and environmental conditions that are projected to increase due to climate change. For example, the implementation of warning systems in France after devastating heat waves in 2003 reduced morbidity and mortality in vulnerable groups during subsequent heat waves by 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hurricane evacuation notices have been shown to increase the likelihood of evacuation among coastal residents when disseminated by public officials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are associated with differences in perceived risk of natural disasters, as well as how individuals obtain and react to information about natural disasters, extreme weather and environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Previous research on broadcast warnings about extreme weather events and natural disasters identifies target audiences by demographic characteristics that are associated with increased vulnerability to health impacts (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Delivery channels for these messages have included internet-based interventions, media sources (television, radio, newspaper) and printed materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Qualitative research among residents of cities with racial/ethnic- and SES-related disparities in heat-related morbidity and mortality described how cooling practices during heat waves may vary according to differences in risk perceptions, resources and social norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Another qualitative study conducted among low-SES racial and ethnic minorities observed that respondents were especially attuned to the effects of local, acute environmental health risks (e.g., sanitation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Health communication materials have potential to improve knowledge, attitudes and protective behavior related to climate change and health among vulnerable populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Previous research provides guidance on message development to improve accessibility to a variety of audiences. Design features that address literacy, visual, and auditory limitations include a variety of text or visual aids (e.g., symbols, images), large print and/or Braille [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other aspects to consider are language and culture of the intended audience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Taylor-Clarke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] suggest the use of concise materials, designed to reduce frustration in navigating an abundance of information, that also address potential inequities in Internet access.</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has tested the effectiveness of communication materials that target vulnerable populations and describe the health impacts of climate change due to weather and environmental conditions that are projected to increase in intensity and frequency. This study defines vulnerable individuals as having at least one of the chronic health condition(s) projected to be impacted by climate change present in the household (respiratory illness including asthma, pollen allergies, heart disease, obesity or diabetes) and low socioeconomic status as defined by income and educational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>This mixed-methods study was designed to test whether: (1) viewing targeted educational materials increases knowledge about health effects of climate change among vulnerable groups; (2) greater knowledge of these health effects is associated with stronger intentions to practice recommended behaviors toward climate change preparedness (&#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d;) and prevention (&#x0201c;mitigation&#x0201d;); and (3) viewing targeted educational materials strengthens certainty that climate change is happening and that it impacts health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study tested the effectiveness of health communication materials to inform their eventual use in community-based settings using a quasi-experimental pre-post study design.

The online survey was administered during June/July of 2015. Respondents were recruited from online community bulletin boards in select metropolitan areas using a nonprobability purposive sampling design. Metropolitan regions were selected for relatively poor air quality, racial/ethnic diversity and high proportion of low-income residents. Metropolitan areas (with estimated population sizes in 2014) were: Los Angeles, CA (13.3 million); Houston, TX (6.5 million); Philadelphia, PA (6.1 million); Atlanta, GA (5.6 million); Detroit, MI (4.3 million); and Cleveland, OH (2.1 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Multiple geographically dispersed metropolitan areas were sampled to ensure variability&#x000a0;across multiple climate regions in the United States, but was not done with the intention of drawing conclusions about regional differences between respondents. The largest number of respondents was from California (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38, 33&#x000a0;% of the sample), followed by Pennsylvania (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35, 30&#x000a0;%), Texas (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20, 17&#x000a0;%), Georgia (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12, 10.4&#x000a0;%), and Midwestern states (Ohio or Michigan, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10, 8.7&#x000a0;%). Due to the small number of respondents per city, respondents cannot be considered representative of households in each geographic region. To address concerns about validity of participants&#x02019; location, the survey software screened respondents&#x02019; Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to ensure that physical location corresponded with the sampled geographic region.</p><p>The recruitment announcement invited participants with select chronic conditions (asthma, allergies, heart disease, obesity and diabetes) in the household to determine their eligibility for an online survey. Respondents to the online recruitment advertisement took a brief screening survey that screened according to socioeconomic status (those with an annual household income lower than $40,000 and educational attainment lower than a 4-year college degree met inclusion criteria). The $40,000 income criterion was selected to provide an initial approximation of households living below &#x0201c;reasonable comfort level&#x0201d; and to exclude high-income respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. &#x0201c;Low income&#x0201d; has been defined elsewhere as twice the federal poverty level, determined as a function of household income and family size (for example, in 2015, a low-income household of three people earning less than $40,180.00 is at 200&#x000a0;% of the federal poverty level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It was not possible to screen on the basis of this formula due to technological constraints, but restricting the household income to $40,000 ensured that regardless of family size, we were almost certainly preventing &#x0201c;high income&#x0201d; respondents from participating. Data was also collected on household size. Post hoc analysis of the demographic data based on family size and household income revealed that most of the sample (82&#x000a0;%) fell at or below 200&#x000a0;% of the federal poverty guidelines. The two most affluent respondents in our sample each lived in a single-person household with an income between $31,000 and $40,000.</p><p>The study materials were administered to respondents using an onscreen version of the posters within an online survey interface. Each respondent was shown a total of five posters in randomized order.</p><p>The survey measured changes in knowledge of environmental contributors to health symptoms, and climate change beliefs, before viewing the study materials (pre-test) and after (post-test).

Prior to viewing any posters, all said they had heard of climate change. However, when probed to describe climate change (including as it related to health), responses revealed that day-to-day experiences with weather informed many of their concepts about climate change. Only two spontaneously mentioned the term &#x0201c;global warming&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The climate change today is okay.

You can tell the difference as far as the climate outside.&#x0201d;</italic></p><p>-- Respondent with pollen allergies and a child with asthma</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Theme 2: Emphasis on immediate-term health management</title><p>Respondents regarded the posters primarily as straightforward instructions for what to do to protect themselves from weather and/or environmental triggers. Respondents focused mainly on the health management aspect of the posters, citing the &#x0201c;health tips&#x0201d; as the most useful component of the posters. Most respondents had better recall and could spontaneously describe immediate-term recommendations (i.e., to deal with the short-term health effects of weather conditions) than any other information on the posters.</p><p>For example, one poster sought to connect individual food choices with health issues (obesity and heart disease) as well as carbon footprint (i.e., resource-intensive agriculture including meat production, non-local foods and processed foods). This health message used an adaptation approach to reduce individual health risk to extreme heat by lowering obesity and heart disease, while the carbon footprint message used a mitigation approach to describe individual food choices that affected the environment. Participants focused almost exclusively on the &#x0201c;healthy eating&#x0201d; message. Multiple respondents had received heart disease or obesity advice previously from their doctors, and said that the posters reinforced this advice. However, none responded to the carbon footprint components of the food posters, except to express confusion about how some of the images (e.g., a factory used to manufacture processed foods emitting air pollution) related to healthy eating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Theme 3: Disconnected from collective action on climate change</title><p>Interview participants expressed little interest in longer-term climate change mitigation strategies (e.g., using less energy or voting for clean power). Two respondents touched upon systemic issues, such as food pricing or companies that pollute the air. These respondents expressed a desire for more information, but they also regarded these issues as under the control of external forces. These external forces were repeatedly spoken of as &#x0201c;they,&#x0201d; though whether &#x0201c;they&#x0201d; are government, corporations or some other social forces was unclear. Despite some interest in external, systemic factors, the posters did not help respondents make connections between individual actions and collective action.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;You know what they should do?

Respondents felt that seeing real faces would be more relatable and instructive. Suggestions included dynamic images of people suffering from the health conditions described in each poster (e.g., being overheated, sneezing or having red, watery eyes from allergies) and taking some kind of protective action.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;It should have someone that&#x02019;s actually having some asthma problem.

Doctor&#x02019;s offices and health clinics were nearly unanimous suggestions. Another popular idea was public transportation (inside the subway and on buses, or in subway or bus stations). Offices of health and human services or social services, or transitional housing, were offered as a way to reach target audiences, as were cafeterias, fast food restaurants and grocery stores.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study found that viewing concise, targeted messages about the health impacts of climate change significantly increases knowledge and beliefs about the relationship between climate change and health among chronically ill, low-SES populations. Another major finding was that greater knowledge of vulnerabilities and triggers is associated with these populations having greater intentions to practice recommended behaviors for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Believing that climate change is affecting their health or household members&#x02019; health also predicted higher behavioral intentions. Our study demonstrates that health communication materials targeting vulnerable audiences regarding climate change impacts on chronic health conditions increase knowledge and beliefs about climate change. It cannot be determined, based on the results of this study, whether these increases in knowledge and beliefs about climate change will result in sustained behavior change, but higher knowledge scores were significantly associated with positive behavioral intentions in these results. Health behavior theories describe knowledge, beliefs and behavioral intention as predictors of behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that messages about extreme weather events, such as heat waves and hurricanes, can successfully reduce risk behaviors, morbidity and mortality associated with these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Qualitative research has previously found that the public is receptive to messages about climate change with a public health frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and other research has demonstrated that low-SES populations may have immediate-term, pragmatic priorities and interests regarding environmental impacts on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our findings support both of these conclusions. Our results indicate that framing climate change as a health issue is, indeed, an effective approach for vulnerable audiences, and the most positively received content addressed individual, immediate-term health effects and practical advice for protective behaviors.</p><p>Certainty in belief that climate change is happening, as well as belief that climate change was affecting health, both increased significantly upon viewing the study materials. A substantial proportion of respondents replied that they &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; whether climate change is happening, or whether it is harming their health, at baseline. The majority of movement on belief ratings was the shift from &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; (at pre-test) to affirmative responses (at post-test). Previous audience segmentation research regarding climate change has categorized respondents with high levels of uncertainty and low issue involvement as &#x0201c;the Disengaged&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Disengaged segment has a greater proportion of racial or ethnic minorities and low-SES individuals than any of the six identified audience segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our sample reflected these demographics as well. If the respondents who responded &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; to questions about belief certainty had qualified as &#x0201c;Disengaged&#x0201d; prior to viewing the study materials, our study provides some evidence that engaging this audience segment on an issue that is immediately relevant to them &#x02013; their chronic health condition &#x02013; is an effective way of reaching them with climate change communication and disambiguating their beliefs about climate change.</p><p>Of particular interest is the significant improvement in knowledge that heat and carbon dioxide are allergy triggers between pre- and post-test. Respondents were largely aware at baseline that plants are allergy triggers, and a substantial proportion extrapolated that longer growing seasons for plants would trigger allergies. However, the role of heat and carbon dioxide is more distal. Higher heat and greater levels of carbon dioxide contribute to longer growing seasons and allow pollen-producing plants to flourish (a mechanism that was explained in the allergy poster). Before viewing the study materials, less than half of respondents chose heat and carbon dioxide as allergy triggers, but a significantly greater proportion correctly identified the role of these triggers at post-test. However, qualitative interviews revealed that other explanations for complex mechanisms conveyed in these materials may need improvement; the food systems poster, for example, did not resonate beyond reinforcing existing knowledge about healthy eating.</p><p>Qualitative interviews revealed that vulnerable audiences are primarily concerned with the immediate-term health impacts in the posters, and particularly protective behaviors, that affect them or their families. &#x0201c;Staying healthy&#x0201d; was a desirable goal, and adaptation appeared to resonate most with this audience. There was little interest in longer-term climate change mitigation strategies, and interview participants did not connect the role of individual behaviors to climate change mitigation, despite this information being provided by the posters. Climate change, like the weather conditions that participants used to describe their understanding of it, is the domain of systemic forces and seen as outside of their control; by contrast, personal health is within their locus of control.</p><p>The posters were effective in improving knowledge when administered online. However, both survey respondents and in-depth interview participants maintained that they would best be displayed in poster form, in locations frequented by target audiences -- doctor&#x02019;s offices, public transportation, social services buildings and retail establishments.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has multiple limitations that must be considered in the design of future research that expands upon these preliminary findings. This was a study to test health communication materials of previously unknown effectiveness, not an evaluation of an intervention or a mass media campaign, and questions about generalizability remain. This study relied on a small sample of users of an online community bulletin board in multiple cities. Online surveys present several advantages, including efficient access to a geographically diverse population, targeted recruitment of a unique population (low income and chronically ill), and the reduction of response bias on a potentially controversial topic caused by a researcher&#x02019;s presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Issues related to sampling were the primary disadvantage of using an online survey for this study. A link to the survey was posted on a public, regional online bulletin board and therefore it is impossible to (a) estimate response rate (i.e., how many eligible individuals viewed the recruitment advertisement and elected to respond), (b) determine the extent to which bulletin board users are representative of the target population, and (c) generate a sampling frame due to the unknown size of the community of billboard users, and what proportion of all residents of the geographic region they comprise. It is also difficult to determine whether respondents are accurately representing their demographic characteristics, although this is similarly a concern with traditional paper surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The small sample size may not be adequately representative of the target audience, particularly within each city. Furthermore, selection bias is likely because the study did not employ random selection of respondents (or cities), and online community bulletin board users may differ from target audience members to an unknown degree (e.g., in terms of Internet access).</p><p>Recruitment ads were posted in locations that were selected according to demographic characteristics (low income and high racial/ethnic diversity) and environmental conditions (poor air quality) to ensure that local populations may resemble the target audience. Respondents were further screened individually to meet inclusion criteria for low income and low educational attainment. Additionally, the survey software allowed for screening of IP addresses by geographic region, so the validity of respondents&#x02019; physical location corresponding with desired geographic criteria was reasonably assured. Despite the small sample size, significant changes were observed in measures of knowledge and beliefs about climate change. Future research can expand this work by applying a probability sampling method in large-scale evaluations of message interventions or media campaigns to ensure representativeness and therefore generalizability. This survey employed a quasi-experimental pre-post design to measure within-subject changes, but additional studies may include a control condition to determine the extent of testing effects on increases in knowledge or beliefs.</p><p>There is a possibility of desirability bias. The recruitment announcement did not mention climate change, but it did announce that a study was being conducted among individuals with specific health conditions in their household. Respondents&#x02019; self-reporting of their household health condition(s) cannot be verified for accuracy. It is possible that, knowing only that it was a study on health conditions, respondents exaggerated their poor household health status to meet survey criteria. (Respondents were not, in fact, excluded if they replied they had none of the specified health conditions; even so, less than three percent said they had none). It is therefore possible that survey respondents are healthier than self-reported. However, the most common reported chronic condition was asthma, and levels of knowledge for asthma triggers were high at pre-test, reflecting experience with asthma that corresponds with the high prevalence of self-reported household asthma. The other area of potential desirability bias is at post-test, after respondents learned that the study was, indeed, about climate change. The increase in stated beliefs about climate change may reflect respondents&#x02019; wish to provide the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; answer after knowing the purpose of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, any social desirability bias may have been tempered by the online survey format, which introduces less social pressure than an interviewer-administered survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, the most compelling results from the study are difficult to fabricate (tests of knowledge), and other results consider the influence of varying levels of knowledge (which is less prone to bias) on behavioral intention (which is more prone to bias). If behavioral intention scores are artificially inflated, the finding could be interpreted to mean that people with more knowledge are more likely to provide biased reports of behavioral intentions. Even in this case, knowledge would be associated with a greater awareness of the desired behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Recommendations for message development</title><p>The materials used for this study were designed to be eye-catching and dynamic illustrations of the relationship between climate change and individual chronic health conditions. Colorful graphics with short text descriptors were an appropriate way to communicate these mechanisms. Based on the findings of the online survey and the qualitative interviews, we have developed recommendations for education materials that target audiences who are vulnerable to climate change health impacts due to their pre-existing health conditions and low SES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Recommendation 1</title><sec id="FPar15"><title>Relate climate change to existing experience with health impacts</title><p>Complicated mechanisms of climate change, including distal or causative forces, can be understood if the eventual outcome is a relevant health impact.

Despite appreciating that there is a link between climate change and health, audiences still regarded the recommended actions as having separate benefits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Recommendation 3</title><sec id="FPar17"><title>Use photographs of people experiencing health conditions</title><p>A consistent suggestion in qualitative interviews was to use photographs of real people experiencing health effects or symptoms that audiences would recognize and empathize with.
