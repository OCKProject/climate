 <p class="p">Invasive alien plants (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>) are a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding and anticipating invasions allow for more efficient management. In this regard, predicting potential invasion risks by 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s is essential to support conservation planning into areas of high conservation value (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AHCV</styled-content>) such as sites exhibiting exceptional botanical richness, assemblage of rare, and threatened and/or endemic plant species. Here, we identified 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AHCV</styled-content> in Georgia, a country showing high plant richness, and assessed the susceptibility of these areas to colonization by 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s under present and future climatic conditions. We used actual protected areas and areas of high plant endemism (identified using occurrences of 114 Georgian endemic plant species) as proxies for 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AHCV</styled-content>. Then, we assessed present and future potential distribution of 27 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s using species distribution models under four climate change scenarios and stacked single‚Äêspecies potential distribution into a consensus map representing 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s richness. We evaluated present and future invasion risks in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AHCV</styled-content> using 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s richness as a metric of susceptibility. We show that the actual protected areas cover only 9.4% of the areas of high plant endemism in Georgia. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s are presently located at lower elevations around the large urban centers and in western Georgia. We predict a shift of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s toward eastern Georgia and higher altitudes and an increased susceptibility of 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AHCV</styled-content> to 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s under future climate change. Our study provides a good baseline for decision makers and stakeholders on where and how resources should be invested in the most efficient way to protect Georgia's high plant richness from 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IAP</styled-content>s.
