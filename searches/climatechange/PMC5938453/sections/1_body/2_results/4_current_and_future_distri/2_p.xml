<p class="p">For the current climate, the SDMs predicted a high suitability for almost all selected 27 IAPs along the coastline in western Georgia and in central Georgia at lower altitudes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Another area of high suitability for IAPs is in eastern Georgia north of Tbilisi, with up to 15 IAPs (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Approximately 11.4% of total Georgian area is not suitable for the IAPs investigated in this study and is mostly located at high elevation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). The area suitable also decreased with the number of IAPs (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The potential distribution of IAPs in Georgia (i.e., PRF) varies highly between species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), ranging from 75% of Georgia' surface (

 <italic class="italic">Hydrocotyle vulgaris</italic>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). However, the ARF of IAPs in the predicted potential distribution (i.e., PRF) is overall low, ranging from 31.6% (

 <italic class="italic">H. vulgaris</italic>), indicating that most suitable areas for IAPs are not invaded yet (Table
