<p class="p">Protected Areas will be slightly less affected by a predicted high suitability of IAPs compared to the total Georgia or AHCV (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Only the southern‐most PAs will stay unaffected and have a lower invasion susceptibility in the future. All other PAs will face a higher risk with increasing areas of high suitability for IAPs, notably in higher elevations. Interestingly, actual PAs seems to be located in areas with low suitability for IAPs (i.e., 21.6% coverage with no suitability for IAPs), while, in contrast, areas of high plant endemism are located on areas with very high IAPs richness (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>).
