<p class="p">For the current climate, the AHCV most at risk due to predicted high suitability of IAPs is in central Georgia north of Kutaisi, in northwestern Georgia in Abkhazia, in western Georgia along the coastline in Samegrelo, and in southwestern Georgia in Adjara (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). The areas with no suitability for IAPs in AHCV represent 9.9% of total AHCV area, while areas with suitability for 1–9, 10–18, and 19–26 IAPs represent 36.2%, 26.6%, and 27.3%, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The AHCV that is not or only barely affected by IAPs is the PAs in the far south in the lesser Caucasus Mountains and in the northeast in the higher Caucasus Mountains (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). The potential distribution of IAPs in AHCV varies highly between species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), ranging from 76.4% of AHCV surface (

 <italic class="italic">H. vulgaris</italic>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). However, the ARF in AHCV is globally low, ranging from 41.7% (
 <italic class="italic">U. europaeus</italic>) to 0.1% (
 <italic class="italic">H. vulgaris</italic>), indicating that most suitable areas for IAPs are not invaded yet (Table
