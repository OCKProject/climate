<p class="p">For the first time, we used an approach which includes both PAs and areas of high plant endemism to identify AHCV at the scale of a country. We found in the case of Georgia that PAs only cover a small portion of the areas of high plant endemism (i.e., 9.4%). We show that areas of high plant endemism are located in areas with higher suitability for IAPs compared to PAs, subjecting endemic plant species to high threats from IAPs. As areas of high plant endemism are located outside official Georgian Protected Areas, they have a lower chance to be included in IAP management programs.</p>
