<p class="p">Presently, the highest concentration of IAPs is in the Adjara region in southwest Georgia, around Tbilisi area, and in central Georgia around Kutaisi (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). The distribution of IAPs is mostly associated with human activity around urban areas (Hulme, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In particular, high soil disturbance and increased traffic around big agglomerations may have further facilitated plant invasions (Catford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), as well as garden escapes from botanical gardens (Hulme, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Our results also demonstrate that all IAPs have largely not yet reached all their potential distribution in Georgia and AHCV (see PRF and ARF values; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), testifying for the recent and ongoing expansion of biological invasions in Georgia. The dispersal of these species should be limited by implementing conservation actions, particularly to limit their dispersal in AHCV.
