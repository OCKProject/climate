<p class="p">A rather alarming finding of our study is that suitable areas for IAPs will increase with warmer climate, notably toward higher altitudes in the greater and lesser Caucasus. Under future climate change scenarios, IAPs will disperse to higher elevation on newly available suitable areas, leading to a decrease in low IAPs richness areas at high elevation. On the other hand, we also observe a decrease in suitability to IAPs at low elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), which means that climate change will also decrease the suitability of some IAPs in the western part of Georgia (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, the species' range response to climate change along elevation gradients is not expected to occur simultaneously with climate change, but with a species‐specific temporal lag explained by variation in physiological and demographic responses, altered biotic interactions and aspects of the physical environment (Alexander et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Although plant communities at higher altitudes are expected to be at lower risk of invasion due to lower propagule pressure and stressful abiotic conditions (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Zefferman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), with increased global connectivity and changing climate, the risk of plant invasions at high altitudes is also predicted to increase (Pauchard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Anticipating which areas are predicted to be at high risk of invasion should greatly increase the efficiency of prevention programs against IAPs (Pauchard et al.,
