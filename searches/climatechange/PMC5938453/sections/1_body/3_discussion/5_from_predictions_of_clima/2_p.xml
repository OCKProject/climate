<p class="p">Our approach predicts the potential suitability for IAPs but cannot consider the true in situ impact of the IAPs on their environment. Our predictions of potential suitability could be improved using finer resolution SDMs (e.g., Descombes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Heinänen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Razgour et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) or by exploiting available knowledge at the species level. In a recent study, a scoring system for invasive species, based on their environmental and socio‐economic impact, was developed (Kumschick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The risk posed by these species could be refined using this scoring system. For example, for the same predicted suitability value, we can expect 
 <italic class="italic">R. pseudoacacia</italic> (i.e., with a global environmental and socio‐economic impact score of 20) to have a 10‐fold higher in situ impact than 
 <italic class="italic">Phytolacca Americana</italic> (global impact score of 2). In addition, trait‐based approaches could be used for assessing and mapping potential niche overlap between native and exotic species (Elleouet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, those analyses need broad data on species morphological traits which are rare for our selected endemic plant species. Furthermore, our models, as every static distribution models based on presence‐only data, cannot predict at which stage of invasion the IAPs are in each region, even if some indicative indexes can be derived (see PRF and ARF values in this study; Descombes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The stage of invasion by IAPs, known by local experts, should be considered when selecting appropriate measures to take against these IAPs (Blackburn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Despite these limitations, knowing which AHCV in Georgia are currently colonized by IAPs and which AHCV show a high climatic suitability under present and future climate is an important information to initiate effective prevention measures against IAPs within AHCV. While AHCV with a high suitability for a large number of IAPs need the highest attention, the AHCV with a low number of highly suitable IAPs should not be ignored, as eradications are usually only successful if done at an early stage of invasion and as single IAP species can already have a huge impact on the whole ecosystem. Such “transformer species” include, for example, 
 <italic class="italic">A. artemisiifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. pseudoacacia</italic> (Ehrenfeld, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
