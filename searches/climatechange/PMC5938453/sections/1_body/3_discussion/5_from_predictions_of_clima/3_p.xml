<p class="p">Recently, we established a monitoring program for IAPs at twelve monitoring sites in five different PAs in the west and in the east of Georgia, with the aim to follow the cover of both IAPs and members of the resident plant community in order to link the potential spread of IAPs with changes in plant biodiversity over time (Slodowicz etÂ al., in press). The established monitoring scheme, presented at a workshop in Tbilisi in June 2015 to NGOs and national authorities, will also allow disentangling effects of biotic resistance (high diversity plots will be more resistance to IAP invasion) from direct negative effects on IAPs on plant diversity.</p>
