<p class="p">Our finding reveals that using PAs as the only proxy for delimiting AHCV (e.g., Thalmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) may be of limited relevance. Protected Areas represent only 7% of the surface of Georgia, which translate the fact that resources allocated to conservation are limited to only a small fraction of areas with conservation value in order to maximize biodiversity protection in complementarity with other PAs in the network of PAs (Foxcroft et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Using data on endemic species allows a more inclusive coverage of AHCV, with a surface reaching 27.4% of the surface of Georgia. Overall, we show that endemics are in large part distributed outside of PAs and are therefore at risk of competition by IAPs, but also by nonsustainable land use such as overgrazing, farming, or urbanization (Reidsma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Seto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). A similar pattern was also found in Armenia (Fayvush et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), where protected natural areas are missing important hotspots of plant endemism and fail to preserve adequately half of the threatened plants according to the IUCN classification (i.e., critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable). This is a strong signal that the already existing PAs in Georgia are not sufficient to protect Georgia's rich biodiversity.
