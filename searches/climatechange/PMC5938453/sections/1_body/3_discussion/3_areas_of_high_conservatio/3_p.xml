<p class="p">The paucity of data on rare and endemic species is a common problem in conservation biology (Engler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Our data make no exception as it contains enough and sufficiently precise data for only 41% of the total number of Georgian endemic species. However, our subset of species is a phylogenetically nonbiased sample representative of Georgian endemic plant species. In addition, the area covered by our AHCV is more or less representative of biodiversity and endemic‐rich areas in Georgia, especially in Abkhazia and Ajara (in the northwesternmost and southwesternmost parts, respectively) supporting Tertiary flora and being known as refugia of remote geological epochs (e.g., Kolakowsky,

 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, more efforts should be invested into recording endemic species to better define endemic‐rich areas in Georgia (i.e., especially in areas poorly investigated) using scientific‐based sampling strategies (e.g., random stratified sampling). Note that while reviewing the list of Georgian endemic plant species, we found out that 11 of them were not endemic, but were synonyms to species ranging beyond the Caucasus region. We thus strongly recommend to critically review and update the current list of Georgian endemic plant species and to put efforts into georeferencing the remaining endemics in order to better define endemic‐rich areas in Georgia.
