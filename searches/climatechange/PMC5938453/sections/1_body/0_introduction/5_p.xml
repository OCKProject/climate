<p class="p">In this study, we identified AHCV in Georgia by combining the delimitation of the PAs with areas of high plant endemism. Here, we consider AHCV as regions exhibiting exceptional botanical species richness and/or particular assemblage of rare, and threatened and/or endemic plant species. We then estimated the susceptibility of AHCV to invasion by 27 IAPs, including IAPs that still have not invaded Georgia and have the potential to become invasive, using SDMs for present and future climate conditions. More specifically, we investigate the following questions: (1) Are Georgia's Protected Areas representative of areas of high plant endemism? (2) Which areas and AHCV in Georgia are more susceptible to IAPs and how will this susceptibility change under future climate scenarios?</p>
