<p class="p">Prevention of biological invasion at the earliest stage is more effective than attempts at management of well‐established infestations (Leung et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In this regard, statistical models such as species distribution models (SDMs; Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) may represent useful tools when implementing conservation actions at large and local scales (e.g., Descombes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Heinänen, Erola, &amp; von Numers, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). SDMs relate environmental characteristics (e.g., climatic and topographic variables) to the current geographical distribution of species in terms of presence/absence to fit species' realized niches and predict the distribution of suitable habitats in space and time. Therefore, SDMs can prove useful in conservation by helping managers to visualize the invasive potential of IAPs (Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) in AHCV. For instance, Thalmann et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) estimated the current and future susceptibility of PAs to 9 IAPs in Georgia with SDMs. However, as human‐mediated biological invasions are recent phenomena presenting an ongoing expansion, there is a need to include a broader number of potential IAPs (e.g., IAPs not occurring yet in the region of interest) for the prevention of biological invasion.
