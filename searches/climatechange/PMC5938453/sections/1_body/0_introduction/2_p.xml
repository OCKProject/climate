<p class="p">Plant invasions have become an increasing threat to agriculture, human health, and local biodiversity (Pimentel, Zuniga, &amp; Morrison,

 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Because invasive alien plants (IAPs) have also become a major issue in protected areas (PAs; Foxcroft, Pyšek, Richardson, &amp; Genovesi, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), there is an urgent need to implement conservation actions to limit the impact of IAPs in areas of high conservation values (AHCV) such as sites exhibiting exceptional botanical richness, assemblage of rare, and threatened and/or endemic plant species. While some countries have already established procedures for the management of IAPs (e.g., USA, Switzerland; Bohren,
