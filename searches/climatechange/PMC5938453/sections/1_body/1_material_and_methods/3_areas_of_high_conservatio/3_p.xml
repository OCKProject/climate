<p class="p">Out of 278 endemic species occurring in Georgia, we retained 114 plant species for which we found occurrence data in Georgia (

 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). From the selected endemic species, 88 species are strictly endemic to Georgia and 26 species are Caucasian endemics (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Occurrence data were collected from the online database Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gbif.org/</ext-link>) and from rich herbarium collections of the National Herbarium of Georgia (TBI), the herbarium of National Museum of Georgia (TGM), the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University Herbarium, and the Batumi Botanical Garden (BAT) In addition, all volumes of the second edition of Flora of Georgia were consulted (except the large family Poaceae that is still not covered in the already published sources), which include information on the localities where the species was collected, frequently on the landmark level but always indicating the nearest settlement/urban areas. We verified that our subset of 114 species was a phylogenetically nonbiased sample of all the endemics. To do so, we constructed the phylogenetic tree of all Georgian endemics (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 279) and the selected georeferenced endemics (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 114) with the online program Phylomatic (Webb &amp; Donoghue, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0526" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and calculated the branch lengths for both trees with the program Phylocom Version 4.2 (Webb et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0527" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We then calculated the mean pairwise distance (mpd) of the selected 114 endemic plants with the “picante” package (Blomberg, Garland &amp; Ives, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0505" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Kembel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0513" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) in R (R Development Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0522" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, Version 3.1.2) and compared it to a null distribution generated from 1,000 random sampling of 114 species across the tips of the phylogenetic tree. We checked whether the mpd value is similar to random samples of the total species pool with a two‐tailed test. The mpd value of the 114 georeferenced endemics showed no significant difference to the mpd values of the 114 randomly sampled endemics (two‐tailed test: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value: .372), indicating that our subset of 114 species is a phylogenetically nonbiased sample of all the Georgian endemics.
