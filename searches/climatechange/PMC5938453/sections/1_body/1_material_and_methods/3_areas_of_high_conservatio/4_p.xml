<p class="p">From endemic occurrences, we generated a map of endemic species richness per pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.0083° (~1 km), using a focal moving window of 0.5° across the Georgian landscape and using a smoothing procedure with the “focal” function of the R package “raster” (Hijmans &amp; Van Etten, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) as the mean of the values in a 0.083° neighborhood (i.e., 10 pixels radius). We considered pixels with more than 15 endemics as areas of high plant endemism and buffered this area by 0.5° in order to take into account the variability introduced by the focal window in the mapping procedure. The threshold of 15 species was chosen to insure that the selected areas of high plant endemism cover approximately 20% of Georgia's surface (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> for a cover representing approximately 10%, 5%, and 1% of Georgia). We considered this area as area of high plant endemism, representing 20.8% of Georgia's surface (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). According to the worldbank database on protected terrestrial areas (

This very low amount of PAs contrasts with the 71 countries having more than 20% of their surface protected, as well as with the neighboring country of Armenia situated in the Lesser Caucasus mountain range with 24.8% of its surface protected. Considering an endemic area covering approximately 20% of the Georgian country ensures to reach similar surfaces for AHCV compared to other worldwide or neighboring countries. As observations of endemics are rare, we used the previous focal window approach, buffers and threshold to lower the impact of the low data availability and to obtain a regional estimate of the endemic richness. Using a smaller focal window, buffers and thresholds would lead to increase the chance of missing areas of high plant endemism due to lower data availability at a local scale. The selected endemic areas represent the Georgian potential areas of high plant endemism based on georeferenced observations. We are not aware of any published sources on areas of concentration of endemic species, which would allow to validate our selected areas of high plant endemism or to assess if some them are missing in some areas of Georgia. Finally, we defined AHCV in Georgia as the combination of areas of high plant endemism and Georgia's protected areas, together representing 27.8% of the Georgian surface (Figure
