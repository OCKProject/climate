<p class="p">We evaluated present and future invasion risks by IAPs for the entire territory of Georgia and for AHCV using predicted IAP richness as a metric of invasion susceptibility and by comparing present to future changes in four richness classes with the same ranges (number of IAPs predicted: 0, i.e., absent; 1–9, i.e., low; 10–18, i.e., medium; and 19–26, i.e. high). Then, for each species in Georgia and AHCV, we calculated a potential range filling index (PRF) and an actual range filling index (ARF) following a procedure modified from Descombes et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). PRF is defined as the percent of area predicted to be suitable in the total area available (predicted area of the species in Georgia/AHCV divided by the total area of Georgia/AHCV). In order to estimate the actual range occupied by the species in Georgia/AHCV, we buffered current occurrences of IAPs by 10 km. ARF is defined as the percent of area actually occupied by the species in the predicted potential distribution of the species in Georgia/AHCV (actual estimated area of the species in Georgia/AHCV divided by the predicted area of the species in Georgia/AHCV). Note that ARF represents the minimal known distribution of the IAPs and that it could be underestimated due to sampling issues.
