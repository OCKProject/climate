<p class="p">To model the future distribution of invasive plant species, we used two different climate projection scenarios for 2050 (i.e., for the 2041–2060 time period) with two different global climate models (GCMs). We used two representative concentration pathway scenarios: RCP 4.5 (moderate, mean global warming increase of 1.4°C) and RCP 8.5 (more severe, mean global warming increase of 2.0°C). We used the GCMs of the Fifth Assessment IPCC report (AR5, 2014); HadGEM2‐AO (Martin et al.,
