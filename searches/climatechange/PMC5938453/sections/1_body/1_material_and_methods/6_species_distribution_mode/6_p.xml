<p class="p">Finally, we averaged the 10 projections of the five algorithms together in a single map and binarised it using a threshold maximizing the TSS. This threshold was obtained by averaging the threshold estimated for each algorithm and iterations with the “optimal.thresholds” function from the “PresenceAbsence” package (Freeman &amp; Moisen, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0510" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) in R. All binarised maps were then combined into one consensus map representing the species richness of IAPs, used in this study as a metric of invasion susceptibility (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). We finally summed species mean predictions of habitat suitability (mean of the five different algorithms) of all IAPs together in a single map representing a global invasion risk and found a strong and significant correlation between this map and the richness map inferred from binary conversion (Spearman correlation:
