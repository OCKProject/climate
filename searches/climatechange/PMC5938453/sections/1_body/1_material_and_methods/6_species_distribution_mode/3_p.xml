<p class="p">To calibrate the models, we firstly avoided spatial autocorrelation in the presences data using the disaggregation tool provided by the “ecospat” package (Broennimann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) in R by setting a minimal distance of 0.083° between presences. We then selected randomly a set of pseudo‐absences (also known as background data; Wisz &amp; Guisan, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Pseudo‐absences were drawn within the biomes occupied by the species. For this task, we used 14 biomes from the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Olson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0519" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). With this approach, we ensure that pseudo‐absences are drawn only from regions where the species occurs and that have been accessible as the species speciated (Barve et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Thalmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) . We selected randomly the same amount of pseudo‐absences than presences, gave equal weights to presences and pseudo‐absences in the calibration of the model, and averaged several runs (Barbet‐Massin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We ran 10 iterations of models, avoiding spatial autocorrelation among presences, and sampling each time the pseudo‐absences within the biomes where the species occurs.
