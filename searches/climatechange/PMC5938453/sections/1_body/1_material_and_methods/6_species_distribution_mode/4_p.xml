<p class="p">To evaluate the capacity of the models to correctly predict the presence and absence of the species at the global scale, we used the previously selected set of presences and pseudo‐absences for each iteration. Models were calibrated on a random sample of 70% of the presences and pseudo‐absences data, and evaluated on the remaining 30%. We used the area under the ROC plot curve (AUC; Fielding &amp; Bell, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS; Allouche et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), which both evaluate the ability of the model to discriminate presences from absences. AUC varies between 0 (counter prediction) and 1 (perfect prediction), 0.5 meaning random predictions. TSS is scaled between −1 and 1, 0 meaning random predictions. As biological invasions are ongoing processes, the selected absences may not be representative of true absences and may thus bias the evaluation (Václavík &amp; Meentemeyer, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). We thus added one presence‐only evaluator: the sensitivity calculated on predictions binarised with the threshold providing the best TSS. The sensitivity is a threshold‐dependent evaluator corresponding to the rate of presences correctly classified by the model. Models are considered to have reliable prediction performances with AUC values &gt; 0.70 (i.e., excellent AUC  &gt;  0.90; good 0.80  &lt;  AUC  &lt;  0.90; fair 0.70  &lt;  AUC  &lt;  0.80; poor AUC  &lt;  0.70; see Swets, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) and TSS values &gt; 0.40 (i.e., excellent TSS  &gt;  0.75; good 0.40  &lt;  TSS  &lt;  0.75; poor TSS  &lt;  0.40; see Landis &amp; Koch, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1977</xref>). Finally, evaluators were averaged for all models and replicates (10 iterations).
