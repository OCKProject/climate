<p class="p">In addition, we evaluated the predictive performance of the models in Georgia by calibrating the models with all occurrences and pseudo‐absences present outside Georgia (i.e., presences and pseudo‐absences inside Georgia were removed from the data) and by evaluating the models on presences and random pseudo‐absences selected in Georgia by following the same procedure as above for pseudo‐absences selection. Predictive performance of the models in Georgia was only assessed for 19 IAPs species that presented more than 10 occurrences after avoiding spatial autocorrelation. Evaluators were averaged for all models and replicates (10 iterations).</p>
