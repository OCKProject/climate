<p class="p">The choice of the selected pseudo‐absences sampling strategy can profoundly affect SDM predictions (e.g., Gu &amp; Swihart, 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0504" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), which may vary between statistical models (Barbet‐Massin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). To assess the reliability of our results, we compared our IAPs richness map to richness maps obtained with two different pseudo‐absences sampling strategies: (1) a larger number of randomly selected pseudo‐absences (here 5k more than number of occurrences) with equal weighting for presences and pseudo‐absences as recommended by Barbet‐Massin et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and (2) a biased background using a target‐group sampling approach where a same number of pseudo‐absences and occurrences are randomly selected from the total IAPs occurrences (see Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0517" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0521" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). All pseudo‐absences were selected into the biomes where the species occurs. Overall, we found a very strong correlation between our initial IAPs richness map and the richness maps derived from higher number of pseudo‐absences (Spearman correlation: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .98, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value &lt; .001) and from target‐group pseudo‐absences selection (Spearman correlation: 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = .91, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value &lt; .001), which supports and gives confidence to our methodology.
