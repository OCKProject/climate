<p class="p">The non‐native flora of Georgia comprises 380 species (excluding cultivated species which are not, or only rarely found in the natural environment), representing 8.9% of the total flora of Georgia, of which 16 plant species are actually considered as major threat and classified as IAPs (Kikodze et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Richardson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). We selected 27 IAPs (including all 16 recognized IAPs in Georgia) presenting more than 100 occurrences worldwide and showing high potential to become invasive based on their status in other European countries with similar climatic conditions (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref> for details on the selected IAPs). Among the selected IAPs, the most noxious ones are

 <italic class="italic">Ailanthus altissima</italic> (see Thalmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Occurrence data (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 374,232) were collected from several Georgian herbaria (i.e., Georgian State Museum, Tbilisi State University Herbarium, and Batumi Botanical Herbarium), from occurrence points collected in the field with a GPS device (Garmin GPSMAP 64), from a previous study (Thalmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and from the online database GBIF (

 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). GBIF data are known to be subject to spatial bias and accuracy issues, especially in species identification, taxonomy, or GPS precision (e.g., Beck et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Meyer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0518" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) . Thus, all IAPs used in this study were checked for synonyms in the data collection, missing or clearly false locality coordinates were removed from the analyses, and our modeling procedure includes a disaggregation strategy reducing the potential spatial bias (Beck et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34005-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Because 28% of the downloaded GBIF data contained no information about the precision of the observation, we decided to keep all the observations. So far, IAP occurrences in Georgia are mainly found in the Adjara region in southwestern Georgia and in the Samegrelo region in western Georgia and around the cities of Kutaisi and Tbilisi (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34005-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). However, those distributions may be the result of sampling bias close to cities and along main roads.
