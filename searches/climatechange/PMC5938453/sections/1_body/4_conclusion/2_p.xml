<p class="p">Our study showed that firstly, large AHCV with high plant endemism in Georgia are currently located outside of PAs and thus beyond the scope of established conservation management. Here, populations of rare and endemic plant species are specifically at risk due to IAPs. Secondly, large parts of the AHCV are already struggling with high numbers of IAPs, notably in Adjara and Samegrelo in southwestern Georgia, in central Georgia around Kutaisi and in eastern Georgia north of Tbilisi. Thirdly, many IAPs are predicted to shift with changing climate toward higher altitudes and toward the east, potentially threatening AHCV in south‚Äêcentral Georgia.</p>
