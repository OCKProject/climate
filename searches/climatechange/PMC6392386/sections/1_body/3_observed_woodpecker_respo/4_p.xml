 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) noted that resource specialization and scale‐dependent habitat selection will be important factors in species population responses to climate‐induced habitat change. This means that accounting for such ecological niche shifts (i.e., loss of nesting trees) and subsequent habitat selection in models is important to capture the vulnerability of species and biodiversity dynamics of an ecosystem.
