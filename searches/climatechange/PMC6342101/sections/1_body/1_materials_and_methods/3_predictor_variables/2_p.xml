<p class="p">A set of 19 bioclimatic variables (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>) at 30 s resolution were obtained from the Worldclim database (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) for current climate (1950–2000) and future climate scenarios for 2070 (average for 2061–2080). The data applied here are the recent IPCC‐CMIP5 climate projections from five Global Circulation Models (GCMs; CCSM4, CNRM‐CM5, HadGEM2‐ES, MIROC5 and MPI‐ESM‐LR) under three representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). To minimize overfitting of the models, I calculated inter‐correlations among 19 bioclimatic variables, and removed one of the two variables when correlation coefficient &gt; |0.70| was obtained. Consequently, eight bioclimatic variables were used to construct species distribution models(bio2, bio4, bio5, bio8, bio12, bio15, bio17 and bio18; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Li, Xu, Wong, Qiu, Sheng, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Slope and aspect were derived from a DEM with a resolution of 90 m, which was obtained from USGS. Global human footprint index at 1 km resolution was collected as human interference data, which integrates disturbance variables such as land‐use change, infrastructure and population density (Sanderson, Jaiteh, Levy, Redford, &amp; Wannebo, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Because reliable future projection of human footprint index is not available, and including static variables in models alongside dynamic variables can improve model performance (Li, Xu, Wong, Qiu, Sheng, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), I kept these variables static in our projections.
