<p class="p">I overlaid the current and future species habitat maps with the boundary of NRs to explore the changes of climatically suitable habitat for each endangered species within NRs under climate change (Araújo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Velásquez‐Tibatá, Salaman, &amp; Graham, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). It is crucial for improving conservation effectiveness to evaluate the impacts of climate change on species richness and turnover across time within conservation networks (Hole et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The Qinghai NR network includes 45 separate polygon boundaries of conservation subareas (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In order to illustrate the conservation effectiveness of different regions and assess the change of species assemblages, I also conducted a separate analysis of the average change in species richness and turnover for each conservation subarea from the current to the future period.
