<p class="p">This index is usually used to measure the intensity of species change in a region with a range from 0 to 100 (Ramirez‐Villegas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). It has a lower limit of zero when “species gain” and the “species loss” are both zero (this is generally not possible to happen), and 100 represents a complete species change from one period to another (i.e., the species gain or loss equals to the initial species richness and there is no loss or gain, respectively).
