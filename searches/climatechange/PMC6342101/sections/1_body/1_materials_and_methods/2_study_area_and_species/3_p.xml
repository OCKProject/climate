<p class="p">In this study, I integrated species distribution data from two sources to achieve maximum representation of biodiversity and compensate for limitations in data availability on the high latitude region: (a) China key rare and endangered species database collected by The Nature Conservancy’s China biodiversity blueprint project. This database has been successfully used to predict climate change‐induced range shifts of Galliformes in China (Li, Tian, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and endemic and endangered species in China (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). It was once employed to identify conservation priority areas in “China national biodiversity conservation strategy and action plan (2011–2030)” (Ministry of Environmental Protection 2010); (b) Chinese Endangered Species Information System (CESIS; Xie, Chen, Zou, Wang, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). This system collected the latest endangered species information including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish species or subspecies in China. Both the theoretical and practical simulations show that when the number of species presence points is &gt;14, the species distribution model can produce a better simulation result of species habitat (Proosdij, Sosef, Wieringa, &amp; Raes, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, I excluded these species with &lt;15 presence points from the two databases, and obtained species presence data for 59 key rare and endangered animal species, which represents the indicator species of biodiversity conservation in Qinghai Province (see details in Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Among these species, there were 39 species with more than 100 presence points, and 51 species with over 50 presence points. The minimum number of occurrences was 21.
