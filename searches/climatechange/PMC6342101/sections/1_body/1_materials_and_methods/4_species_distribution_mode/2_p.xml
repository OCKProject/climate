<p class="p">The maximum entropy approach (Phillips, Anderson, &amp; Schapire, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) was employed to project habitat suitability for 59 rare and endangered species on Qinghai Plateau, which has shown to be one of the best performing models in predicting species distributions with presence‐only data (Elith et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and it has been extensively applied to project species range and vegetation shifts under climate change (Ponce‐Reyes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Rebelo, Tarroso, &amp; Jones, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Wong, Li, Xu, &amp; Long, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The full extent of the study area was used to extract 10,000 pseudo‐absence points to improve model performance (Li, Xu, Wong, Qiu, Sheng, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; VanderWal, Shoo, Graham, &amp; Williams, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). I built the distribution model for the each species using the selected eight bioclimatic variables, and three environmental variables (slope, aspect, and human footprint index) as predictors. A total of five GCMs were used to produce probability outputs for each scenario. I performed 10 replications and a maximum of 500 iterations for each species, using a cross‐validation procedure where I divided our dataset using 75% of the data for model calibration and retaining 25% of the data for evaluation. I calculated the average predicted probability of occurrence across the five GCMs for each grid as our ensemble forecast (Hole et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Li, Xu, Wong, Qiu, Li, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Marmion, Parviainen, Luoto, Heikkinen, &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Subsequently, I applied the Maximum Training Sensitivity Plus Specificity as the threshold to define the presence–absence distribution of species habitats, as this method has been found to be a robust approach (Fajardo, Lessmann, Bonaccorso, Devenish, &amp; Muñoz, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Liu, Berry, Dawson, &amp; Pearson, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). The Areas under the Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a widely‐used approach, was adopted to evaluate the model performance of our species models. As AUC is not appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary predictions, I also used true skill statistic (TSS) as suggested by recent studies (Li &amp; Guo, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Lobo, Jiménez‐Valverde, &amp; Real, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) to assess the accuracy of the studied species models. The TSS takes into account both omission and commission errors, and success as a result of random guessing and ranges from −1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement and values of zero or less indicate a performance no better than random. It is a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence–absence maps (Allouche, Tsoar, &amp; Kadmon, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Mainali et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). I used both presence and background data for calculating AUC and TSS. The true absence data was unavailable in our study, so I used the randomly extracted background points within the whole study area for ROC analysis and calculate AUC and TSS (Please see Supporting Information Table
