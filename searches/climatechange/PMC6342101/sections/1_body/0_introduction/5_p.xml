<p class="p">Qinghai Province is situated in the northeast of the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau. As a traditionally sparsely inhabited region with a variety of different climatic zones and natural habitats, it provides important habitats for the Tibetan antelope (

 <italic class="italic">Procapra przewalskii </italic>and other key rare and endangered animals. It is the highest and biggest Plateau, one of the most sensitive regions to climate change in the world (Li, Powers, Xu, Zheng, &amp; Zhao, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Climate change will lead to higher temperatures and more precipitation in most areas in the year 2061–2080 under three RCPs from Global Circulation Model‐HadGEM2‐ES compared with the current climate condition. (Table

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, it has not been clear how climate change might affect the conservation of key rare and endangered species in Qinghai province. For the first time, this paper aims: (a) to project the potential climate change impacts on the habitats of the key rare and endangered species, species richness, and species turnover in Qinghai province; (b) to assess the efficacy of the existing nature reserves (NRs) for protecting these key species under future climate change; and (c) to comprehensively propose the adaptation strategies of biodiversity conservation in Qinghai province.
