<p class="p">The impacts of climate change on species distributions also referred to as “species distribution models”, have been generally assessed through ecological niche models. These niche‐based models project species distributions by analyzing the relationships between species distributions and a number of environmental variables (Synes &amp; Osborne,

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Although these relatively simple models may under‐represent complex natural systems by neglecting competitive interactions, species plasticity, adaptation and time‐lag (Davis, Jenkinson, Lawton, Shorrocks, &amp; Wood,

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), with a good understanding of the modeling techniques, and appropriate model validation and testing, they can be regarded as the primary tools for projecting species habitats and extinction risk, evaluating conservation priorities and assessing reserve designs (Akçakaya, Shm, Mace, Stuart, &amp; Hiltontaylor,

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, they play a critical role in supporting spatial conservation planning, especially when conservation biologists are often pressed to make recommendations about conserving biodiversity based on limited species distribution data under climate change (Addison et al.,
