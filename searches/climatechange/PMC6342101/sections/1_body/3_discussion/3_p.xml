<p class="p">Under the assumption of species universal dispersal, the spatial distribution pattern of species richness and turnover would experience great changes due to the shifts of species habitats, although the conservation effectiveness of NR network as a whole would not be changed too much under the future climate change. However, climate change may have a great impact on the conservation effectiveness of NRs in some local areas of Qinghai Province. Future conservation strategies should focus on those areas with relatively large changes. In June 2016, China's first national park system pilot was started in the Sanjiangyuan area of the Qinghai‚ÄêTibet Plateau, which would be the world's biggest national park. Our study can provide basic information on climate change impacts for adjusting the existing NRs and developing the first National Park in China, aiming eventually to protect important natural ecosystems and wildlife and ensure sustainable use of natural resource in Qinghai Province.</p>
