<p class="p">First, most of the existing NRs are located in the southern part of Qinghai Province to protect plateau alpine meadow and wetland, which fail to fully represent the species richness in the eastern part of Qinghai Province. This simulation results show that under both current and future climate conditions, a great number of rare and endangered species inhabit the Haidong and the eastern part of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai province, which have higher species richness and conservation value, and will become one of the areas with high species richness in the future. Judging from the conservation efficiency of unit area, these areas should be the focal points of the biodiversity conservation in Qinghai province under climate change.</p>
