<p class="p">Secondly, future conservation strategies should focus on areas with more new species, including Dangqu Conservation Subarea and Guozongmu Conservation Subarea in Sanjiangyuan NR, Dangheyuan Conservation Subarea and Heiheyuan Conservation Subarea in Qilian Mountain NR, as well as the border area between Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Haixi Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture. These areas should implement the climate change adaptation conservation planning, including the establishment of new NRs or dynamic adjustment of NR boundary. Finally, some NRs would face bigger species turnover under climate change, and meanwhile, they would also win more increase in the number of species. The area with higher species turnover means the severer change than other areas. Therefore, biodiversity conservation strategy in the future should increase the investment and enhance management in corridor construction between these NRs and their surrounding areas to improve the connectivity and their ability to adapt to climate change and the migration of species dispersal. These areas include: Qinghai Nuomuhong Provincial NR, Qinghai Chaidamu Haloxylon ammodendron Forest NR, and Tuanjiefeng Conservation Subarea in Sanjiangyuan National NR.</p>
