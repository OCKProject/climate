<p class="p">Although our models indicate good predictive ability, there are several sources of uncertainties in adopting current species–climate relationships to project future climate conditions of species niches. First, there is a lack of sufficient information on biodiversity in Qinghai province. In particular, the habitat characteristics and threat factors of many endangered species are not completely clear. The ongoing investigation of animal and plant resources in Qinghai Province will help to understand the current status of key protected species, including population size, habitat distribution and threat level, which could further improve the accuracy of future assessment. Moreover, it is difficult for the current equilibrium simulation method to take into account any biotic interactions, such as competition with other species or other individuals, predation, and changes in food availability, which may lead to some uncertainty. Furthermore, the species distribution models cannot account for acclimation and adaptation of different species to future climate change. In reality, evolution and adaptation of species could be rapid and potentially help them counter stressful conditions or realize ecological opportunities arising from climate change. Thus, a future direction for improving predictive accuracy should incorporate evolutionary considerations and interspecific relationship of species, into predictive modeling or exploring the climate adaptive capacity of species to climate change. In spite of this, this study employed widely‐used method to conduct the first preliminary assessment of climate change impacts on rare and endangered species in Qinghai Province, which can provide a key reference for adapting biodiversity conservation strategies to climate change on the Qinghai Plateau.</p>
