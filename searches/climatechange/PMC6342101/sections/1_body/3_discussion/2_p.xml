<p class="p">This study adopted niche‐based models to project potential distribution pattern of the key rare and endangered species in Qinghai Province, and explored the adaptation conservation strategies under climate change. The results suggest that climate change would lead to the expansion of most rare and endangered species habitats, and the shrinking of a few species habitats. This is different from most of the existed research results about the impact of climate change on species habitats in other regions (Warren et al, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). There are two possible reasons for this simulation results: (a) Qinghai province is located at a high altitude, and climate change would lead to more climatically suitable habitats in this region; (b) It is assumed in the process of simulation that these animal species could freely migrate to any new climatically suitable areas. However, due to the impact of natural and man‐made barriers on species dispersal and migration, as well as the destruction and restrictions of habitat conditions outside NRs, most species would possibly confront habitat contraction under future climate change. Limited dispersal scenario for species was not considered in this study. Universal dispersal means that species could disperse to any suitable places for population persistence in future, while limited dispersal means that species only can inhabit only places that are modeled to be suitable both in the present and in future (Li, Xu, Wong, Qiu, Sheng, et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Therefore, universal dispersal scenario was regarded as providing more useful information for implementing human‐assisted adaptation to climate change in future conservation planning.
