<p class="p">Climate change‐induced species range shifts would alter the conservation effectiveness of NR network in protecting these endangered species. The results showed the percentage of habitat in the current NR network for 14–23 species would decrease, while that for 36–45 species would increase under the three climate scenarios. Specifically, under the RCP2.6 scenario, the percentage of habitat in NRs for 23 species would decrease, while that for 36 species would increase. Under RCP4.5 scenario, percentage of 45 species habitats covered by NRs would increase, and it would decrease for 14 species. For RCP 8.5 scenario, it is projected to increase for 41 species and decrease for 18 species.</p>
