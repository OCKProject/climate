<p class="p">All models for the 59 rare and endangered species achieved good or excellent performance, with high‐average AUC scores and low omission rates (OR) at the 10% cumulative threshold value, indicating that these models had a high level of accuracy. According to the AUC model assessment criteria: 0.9–1.0 is excellent; 0.8–0.9, good; 0.7–0.8, general; 0.6–0.7, poor; 0.5–0.6, poor (Swets, 
 <xref rid="ece34761-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). All models have high test AUC values (0.878–0.978), which indicated that our models can reasonably capture species‐climate relationships, and thus can be used to project the future habitat suitability of these studied species in Qinghai Province. The high TSS scores of these models also suggested that only a small percentage of test points fell outside the area predicted as “presence”, and our projections have high accuracy.
