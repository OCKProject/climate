<p class="p">The spatial pattern of current species richness shows a general reduction from low altitude in southeast to northwest high altitude (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34761-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). The maximum value of species richness with 48 is found to occur in the east, north‐east, and south of Qinghai Province. Under future climate scenarios, species richness is predicted to increase in most areas by 2070, but the spatial pattern was similar to that under the current climate condition and species richness still reduce from the southeast to the west (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34761-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Species richness of the Qaidam Basin in northwestern Qinghai province decreased greatly, probably due to rapid temperature rise and the little change of precipitation in this area. Species had to move out of this area in order to find climatically suitable habitats and at the same time, the region is a desert area and there are few species survived there. The areas with the obvious increase of species richness are mainly concentrated in Haixi and Haibei Prefectures at the junction of the southwest area of Qilian mountain area and Yushu Prefecture, because the precipitation and temperature is projected to increase comparatively moderately and most species would find climatically suitable habitats in these areas (Figure
