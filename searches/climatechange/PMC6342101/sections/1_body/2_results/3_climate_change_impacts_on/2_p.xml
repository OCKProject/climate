<p class="p">Climate change would have great impacts on the habitats of the 59 rare and endangered species in Qinghai Province. It would lead to the increase of habitats for about 2/3 studied species and the reduction of habitats for about 1/3 species (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Specifically, under RCP2.6 climate change scenario, 45 species are projected to increase their suitable habitats, and 14 species would lose their current habitats by 2070; Under RCP4.5 scenario, 39 species would expand their suitable habitats, and 20 species would suffer from habitat contraction. Under RCP 8.5 scenario, 43 species are projected to increase their current suitable habitats, and 16 species would have habitat decline in future (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Under the three RCPs, the species with the most habitat loss included
