<p class="p">The extent of pollinator sharing between insect‐pollinated species depends on their spatial proximity. 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> occurs over a 500 m altitudinal gradient from tree‐line to summit in the Rockies (Galen, Zimmer, &amp; Newport, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>). With altitude, this landscape decreases in surface area and thus habitable space (Elsen &amp; Tingley, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This geomorphological pattern implies that all else being equal, 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> populations will have broader ranges in lower parts of the alpine zone where shrubification is ongoing than on the upper tundra slopes that serve as refugia from this process. Separation of flowering times could moderate the impacts of spatial proximity in these low altitude contact zones (Poole &amp; Rathcke, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>). Flowering synchrony is promoted when species share environmental controls on timing of flower development (Post, Pedersen, Wilmers, &amp; Forchhammer, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Thus, if altitudinal immigrants converge with resident species in use of cues for budburst then competitive interactions may ensue among them (Brunet &amp; Larson‐Rabin, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Conversely, asynchrony may arise when close neighbors differ in cues for onset and tempo of flowering (CaraDonna, Iler, &amp; Inouye, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Galen &amp; Stanton, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Asynchronous flowering schedules are thought to evolve under a history of co‐occurrence, when costs of pollinator sharing exceed benefits. Here, we test for overlap in flowering times of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> in contact zones and explore the potential role of shared sensitivity to warmer temperatures in promoting flowering overlap under climate change.
