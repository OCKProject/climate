 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> co‐flowered in all four extant contact zones surveyed in 2016. The 25 locations where collections allowed assessment of flowering time overlap in historic contact zones span a broad latitudinal transect of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, ranging from 37.5 to 40.5°N. Specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> were collected in 16 years between 1907 and 2009 at median altitudes of 3,505 m and 3,523 m, respectively. Statewide, minimum average temperatures early in the growing season (June) in years when collections were made ranged from 8.1 to 13.4°C. Based on collection dates (Julian Day) of these flowering specimens, we found no significant difference in flowering time of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> versus 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> (paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>‐test, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1.45, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 24, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .16; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33272-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Analysis of covariance indicated that flowering times of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> plants show similar advancement under warmer summers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33272-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Latitude (random effect) accounted for 50% of the variance in flowering date and minimum average June temperature in the year of flowering (fixed effect) for 16% (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 5.579, 
 <italic class="italic">df = </italic>1; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .018). Average flowering dates (Julian dates) were similar between species (species χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.2637, 
 <italic class="italic">df = </italic>1; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .607) and exhibited equivalent advancement in years of warmer temperatures (temperature by species interaction, χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.169, 
 <italic class="italic">df = </italic>1; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .68; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33272-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Taken together, results indicate that co‐flowering of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> occurred over a broad range of conditions reflecting similar sensitivity to temperature cues (or unmeasured environmental correlates of temperature) during budburst.
