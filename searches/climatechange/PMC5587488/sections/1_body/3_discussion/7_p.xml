<p class="p">While dioecy is not reported to correlate with HP globally, our results indicate that it may have a greater role than suggested by the limited studies to date. Because HP is intimately associated with male function, specialization of sexes to enhance mating success in dioecious species could intensify HP from male donors under pollinator sharing. For example, males typically exhibit advanced flowering schedules (Ågren,
