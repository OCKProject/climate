<p class="p">In historically stressful alpine environments, plant recruitment is rare, and insect pollinators have a crucial role in promoting outcrossing and seedling establishment (Geib &amp; Galen,

 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Our results indicate that the widespread “shrubification” of these high altitude ecosystems under climate change has potential negative indirect impacts on the quality of insect pollination for a widespread alpine wildflower. Given the implications of these effects for population recruitment, efforts to identify topographic conditions buffering

 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Our results imply they may have considerable conservation value.
