<p class="p">For shrubby willows, the capacity for fast growth, broad environmental tolerance, and preadaptation to open environments may all contribute to their success as local invasives in high alpine ecosystems. Invasiveness predisposes donor species toward more negative HP impacts, perhaps because natives lack past opportunities to evolve tolerance or resistance (Arceo‐Gomez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This hypothesis explains the aggressive HP effects of exotic species, but the extent to which it applies to the locally invasive taxa undergoing “shrubification” is unknown. In light of our findings that willows have a strong negative HP impact on a common tundra wildflower, we suggest this idea deserves further attention.
