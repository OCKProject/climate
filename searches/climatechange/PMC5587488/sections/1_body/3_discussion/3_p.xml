<p class="p">Phenological shifts due to changing temperature and snowmelt schedules under climate change can alter the nature and magnitude of pollinator sharing and thus generate indirect fitness effects on co‐flowering species. For example, advances in snowmelt under warming reduce overlap in flowering time, pollinator sharing, and potential competition for pollination in insect‐pollinated wildflowers of subalpine meadows (Forrest, Inouye, &amp; Thomson, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We surveyed flowering time overlap in four current contact zones and 25 locations where 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> co‐occurred during the past century. Over the range of environmental conditions encompassed in this survey, flowering dates for 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> did not differ significantly and indeed were highly correlated (

While herbarium specimens may be subject to collector bias, direct observations of overlap in four geographically isolated contact zones support the conclusion of temporal overlap in flowering for these species. Together, results indicate that temporal overlap in flowering time is likely as
