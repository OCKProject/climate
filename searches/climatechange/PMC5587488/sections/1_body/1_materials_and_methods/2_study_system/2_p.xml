<p class="p">Interactions between willows, 
 <italic class="italic">Salix brachycarpa‐glauca</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. viscosum</italic> were studied from 1 June–31 July, 2015–2016 at four geographically isolated contact zones in the central Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33272-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a): Pennsylvania Mountain Natural Area (Park Co., 39.253539′N, 106.121690′W); Hoosier Pass West (Summit Co., 39.365065′N, 106.077243′W); Hoosier Pass East (Park Co., 39.35806958′N, 106.05191715′W), and Weston Pass (Park Co., 39.12718009′N, 106.18381408W). At all sites, plants were studied over an altitudinal range of 3,500–3,650 m. Vegetation ranged from a willow‐spruce mosaic (krummholz) at tree‐line to dry alpine meadows, ~50–100 m further upslope. 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> occurs in openings in the krummholz mosaic that have infilled due to willow encroachment over time (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> flower early in the season, typically in mid to late June in these four low alpine contact zones. Both species provide early food resources for flower‐visiting insects in high altitude habitats and are heavily frequented by bumble bee queens during nest establishment (Byron 1978). Individuals depend on insect pollination for outcrossing and reproductive success. The small dioecious flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> bloom in a mass display, offering pollen (male flowers) and nectar (both sexes) to bee and fly pollinators. Plants of 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> have showy, nectar‐rich flowers and are pollinated primarily by long‐tongued nectar‐foraging bumble bees (especially queens of
