<p class="p">In 2016, we surveyed the frequency with which primary pollinators of 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic>, (queens of the bumble bee species 
 <italic class="italic">Bombus balteatus</italic>) carry 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen when foraging from 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> flowers in contact zones. Ten bees (2–3 per site) were captured during visits to 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> within 20 m of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and cooled in vials to facilitate handling. To sample from the pollen pool available for deposition during flower visits, a small cube of fuchsin‐stained gelatin was dabbed gently on noncorbicular areas of the bee's head and body. Bees were then returned to the field and released. Gelatin cubes were melted onto microscope slides and scanned for 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> grains. Because sampling success was likely to vary among specimens due to differences in body size and activity, we scored slides for the presence, but not amount of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen.
