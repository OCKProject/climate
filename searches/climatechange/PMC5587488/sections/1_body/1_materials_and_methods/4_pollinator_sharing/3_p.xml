<p class="p">To survey the amount of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen deposited on pistils of naturally pollinated 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> flowers, we collected styles from senescing flowers of thirty randomly chosen plants in each of the four sites surveyed in 2016. Plants were sampled within a range of 1–20 m from the nearest 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic>. Styles were collected from 2 to 3 flowers per plant after the corollas began to wilt, mounted on slides and stained with fuchsin gel to facilitate pollen identification and enumeration in the laboratory. To assess the prevalence of willow HP at the regional scale and its spatial distribution within the contact zone, we conducted an analysis of covariance with the percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen in the stigma pollen load (
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> contamination) square root transformed to conform to assumptions of ANCOVA as the dependent variable, and site and distance from the nearest 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> shrub as fixed effects (

 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Here and elsewhere we use 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> contamination as an index of HP to facilitate comparisons with the literature (Ashman &amp; Arceo‐Gómez, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and because heterospecific contamination has been demonstrated a major component of pollination quality in past studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> (Galen &amp; Gregory, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>).
