<p class="p">To probe the putative causal factors giving rise to associations between 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP and seed set in nature, we concurrently conducted two experimental pollination treatments. The first treatment, application of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen to all flowers on each plant at the onset of receptivity, tested whether the relationship between seed set and contamination in nature has a causal basis. In the second treatment, hand‐supplementation of outcross pollen to all flowers tested for pollen‐limitation of seed set in nature. If 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP decreases seed set in nature by blocking pollen delivery, then supplementing outcross pollen by hand should increase seed set relative to naturally pollinated controls. Conversely, a negligible impact of pollen addition would suggest that any negative effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP in nature is mediated by postpollination processes.
