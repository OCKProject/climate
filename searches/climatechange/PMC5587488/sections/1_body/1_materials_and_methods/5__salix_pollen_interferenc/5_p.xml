<p class="p">In each of the twenty patches, all flowers on two additional randomly selected plants were pollinated with supplemental conspecific pollen (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 40). In twelve of the experimental patches, all flowers on another randomly selected 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> plant were pollinated with 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen. Pollen was applied by hand to all flowers of plants in conspecific and 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen addition treatments on the first day of female receptivity (stigma lobes unclasped) Dehiscing anthers were taken respectively from flowers of a 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> plant at least 1 m away or from the closest male 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and brushed over the receptive stigma lobes until a layer of pollen was visible. Calyces of the few flowers receptive before the onset of experimental pollinations were marked with a small dot of enamel paint and excluded from seed counts. After all flowers wilted, plants were protected from ungulate herbivores and seeds collections made as described for naturally pollinated individuals. We chose not to include a bagged outcrossed control because deleterious stigma clogging in 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> also occurs from pollinator‐mediated self‐pollination and HP from 
 <italic class="italic">Mertensia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Castilleja</italic> (Galen &amp; Gregory, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Thus, excluding pollinators and generating a pure outcross “control” would eliminate other sources of stigma clogging and likely over‐estimate any negative impact of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP.
