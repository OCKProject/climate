<p class="p">We counted pollen on slides in the laboratory at the State University of New York at Old Westbury using light microscopy. All conspecific and 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen grains under the coverslip were counted for each specimen. We computed a nonparametric (Spearman's) correlation between average seeds per flower and 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> contamination (SAS Proc CORR; 2013). Spearman's correlation was used because data did not fit assumptions of parametric statistics due to heteroscedacity, and transformation did not resolve the problem.
