<p class="p">In 2015, we identified twenty spatially separated (≥5 m) patches of 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> in the contact zone on Pennsylvania Mountain and randomly selected two plants separated by ≥1 m in each patch to assay 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP and seed set under natural pollination. Plants were selected in bud and their flowers were protected from nectar‐thieving ants by surrounding the inflorescence stems with sections cut from plastic drinking straws and coated with Tanglefoot (Galen 1983). Plants had 11.5 ± 3.2 (
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> n</italic> = 40) flowers each. The style was removed from one flower and mounted in fuchsin gel to enumerate deposition of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and conspecific pollen. Prior research shows that most of the variance in pollen receipt among flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> is due to plant‐to‐plant differences rather than variation among a plant's flowers (Galen &amp; Stanton, 
 <xref rid="ece33272-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Stigmas withered and dropped from the flowers on eight inflorescences before collection, reducing the sample size for assessment of 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> HP to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 32. After all flowers wilted, plants were protected from ungulate herbivores using hardware cloth cages. In September, we collected the infructescences and dissected the fruits for seed counts. Average seed set per flower was calculated as the total seed set per plant, divided by the total number of flowers, and was used as a measure of reproductive success. One infructescence was lost due to elk herbivory, reducing the sample size for seed set to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 39.
