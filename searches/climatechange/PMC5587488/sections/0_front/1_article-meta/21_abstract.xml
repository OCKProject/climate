 <p class="p">Under climate change, shrubs encroaching into high altitude plant communities disrupt ecosystem processes. Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium viscosum</italic>. Overlap in flowering time of 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> flowers and on 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic>. To ascertain whether 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen addition. In current and past contact zones 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> pistils. 
  <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for 
  <italic class="italic">Polemonium</italic> and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing.
