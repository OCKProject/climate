<p class="p">To investigate the spatiotemporal variation of SSM in the TRB, we used the monthly data of SM during the period from 1961 to 2010 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°×0.25°, which are obtained from the GLDAS-NOAH-2.0 dataset (

The GLDAS SM data include four layers (i.e. 0–10 cm, 10–40 cm, 40–100 cm, and 100–200 cm). As defined above, the SSM refers the SM in the layer with depth of 0–40 cm, so we only used the data of two layers (i.e. the 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm). To evaluate the availability of GLDAS SM data, we used observation data of relative SM from 1992 to 2010, which were downloaded from China Meteorological Administration (

The observation depth includes 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm, 70 cm, and 100 cm. In this research, we selected the 10 cm and 50 cm observation data to evaluate the GLDAS SM data at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm. The distribution of observation stations is mapped in the
