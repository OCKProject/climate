<p class="p">To make sure the same spatial resolution with 0.25°×0.25° as the SM data, the precipitation and temperature data were resampled by using the bilinear interpolation method, and then use the grid points of SM data that within the areas of each land type to extract the values of precipitation and temperature. The GTOPO30 DEM (about 1 kilometer) is downloaded from USGS (
