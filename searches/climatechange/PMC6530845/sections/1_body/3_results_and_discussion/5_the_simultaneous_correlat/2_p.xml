 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. At the confidence level of 0.05, SM at 0–10 cm in the forest, grassland and desert all have a positive correlation with precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn during the same periods. Due to the relatively abundant precipitation and the relatively small evaporation in autumn, SM at 0–10 cm in the forest and grassland are positively correlated with precipitation in autumn, with the correlation coefficients of 0.5546 and 0.6664, respectively. SM at 0–10 cm in the farmland is positively correlated with precipitation in spring, autumn and winter, and its correlations are more significant in autumn, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6362. However, SM at 0–10 cm in the farmland has no obvious correlation with precipitation in summer. In addition, SM at 0–10 cm in the desert presents a positive correlation with precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn over the same periods, with correlation coefficients of 0.4688, 0.4740, and 0.3781, respectively. It is mainly for the reasons that the impact of precipitation on SSM in the desert is more direct and the increases of precipitation will affect the variation of SSM. The snowmelt in the spring will gradually gather in the middle area due to the terrain, which will make SSM increase to some extent.
