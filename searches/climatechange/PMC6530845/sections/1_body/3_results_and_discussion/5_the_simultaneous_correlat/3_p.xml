<p class="p">SM at 10–40 cm in the forest, grassland and farmland have a significant positive correlation with precipitation in autumn during the corresponding periods, with the correlation coefficients of 0.4134, 0.3086, and 0.4741, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). We can illustrate that SSM in the TRB has relatively significant positive correlation with precipitation in autumn during the corresponding periods. However, the correlation between precipitation and SM at 10–40 cm in the desert is quite weak. In the Taklimakan Desert, the average annual precipitation is only about 50 mm, but its average evaporation is as high as approximately 1200 mm [
