<p class="p">The relationships between SM, precipitation and temperature are quite different from the research in Eastern China [
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The SM in Eastern China of different depths (0–200 cm) is positively correlated with precipitation in spring, summer and autumn. While the SM at 10–40 cm in the TRB is weakly correlated with precipitation. Moreover, the SM at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm of Eastern China is negatively correlated with temperature in winter. However, the SM at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm in the TRB is positively correlated with the temperature in winter.
