<p class="p">SM at 0–10 cm in the forest, grassland and farmland have a significant positive correlation with temperature in winter during the corresponding periods, with the correlation coefficients of 0.3932, 0.3976 and 0.5079, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The main reason is that the higher or lower temperature in winter influences the soil frozen status and hydro-thermal regime [

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. However, the correlation between temperature and SM at 0–10 cm in the desert is unobvious. Moreover, SM at 0–10 cm in the farmland is negatively correlated with temperature in summer. For the reason of high temperature will result in the increases of potential evaporation which will reduce SSM.
