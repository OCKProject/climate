<p class="p">For the simultaneous correlation between temperature and SM of 10–40 cm layer, only SM at 10–40 cm in the forest has a significant positive correlation with temperature in winter during the same periods. Comparing with the other land types, forest mainly distributes in the southern foothill of Tianshan Mountains and near the river, the influence of temperature change on the sunny slope and the river ice is relatively greater.</p>
