The seasonal differences of SM in the forest and grassland are relatively small. SM at 0–10 cm in the desert is the lowest. Besides, SM at 10–40 cm in the farmland and grassland has quite small differences, and both are significantly higher than that in other land types. SM at 10–40 cm in the desert is the lowest. SSM of the farmland in spring and summer are higher than that in other seasons, which are probably influenced by the agricultural irrigation and relatively rich precipitation in summer. The growth of spring wheat requires relatively abundant water, the experiment of the effect of Irrigation on the SM of spring wheat indicated that irrigation has obvious effect on SM [
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Additionally, SSM in the forest, grassland, and desert are commonly highest in the summer. The main reason probably is that precipitation is the principal source of SSM [
