 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, annual average SM at 0–10 cm in the farmland of the TRB is considerably higher than that in other land types. Annual average SM at 0–10 cm in the forest only has small differences with the grassland, and annual average SM at 0–10 cm in the desert is the lowest among all land types (

Additionally, the differences of annual average SM at 10–40 cm between the farmland and grassland are relatively small, and annual average SM at 10–40 cm in the farmland and grassland are considerably higher than other land types. Similarly, annual average SM at 10–40 cm in the desert is the lowest among all land types (
