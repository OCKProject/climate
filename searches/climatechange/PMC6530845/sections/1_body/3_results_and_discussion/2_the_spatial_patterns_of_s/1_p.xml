<p class="p">The SSM at 0–10cm and 10–40cm in the TRB are mapped to show their spatial patterns. We can see that the spatial distribution of SM at 0–10 cm (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>) in the TRB is basically consistent during the study period. The low-value of SSM distributes in the central regions while the high-value distributes in the Pamirs and the southern foothill of Tianshan Mountains with high altitude, and the land types are mainly forest, grassland, and farmland. These regions have relatively abundant precipitation, high vegetation cover, and relatively strong water storage capacity. The low-value of SSM mainly distributes in the Taklimakan Desert, with scarce precipitation, large amount evaporation, and strong water permeability.
