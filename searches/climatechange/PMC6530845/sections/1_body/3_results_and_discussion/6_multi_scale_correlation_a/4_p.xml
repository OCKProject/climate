<p class="p">The results of XWT reveal that the significant correlation between precipitation and SSM mainly distributes in the periods from the 1970s to the early 1990s, and the significant correlation between temperature and SSM mainly distributes in the periods about the 1960s. It is basically consistent with the researches about the variation of drought and waterlogging. The drought of the TRB presented serious in the 1960s, and the transition periods from drought to waterlogging were about the 1970s to the 1980s, while the drought conditions significantly declined in the mid-to-late 1980s [
