 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g009" class="xref">9</xref>. SM at 0–10 cm in the desert has a significant anti-phase relationship with temperature from 1961 to 1969 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). This anti-phase relationship indicates that the SM will decrease with the increases of temperature and it will increase with the decreases of temperature. SM at 0–10 cm in the forest, grassland, and farmland all present an anti-phase relationship with temperature. In addition, SM at 10–40 cm in the desert, forest grassland, and farmland have an anti-phase relationship with temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). We can find that the principal resonant periods of temperature and SSM in the TRB are about 2–3 year, with the anti-phase relation (
