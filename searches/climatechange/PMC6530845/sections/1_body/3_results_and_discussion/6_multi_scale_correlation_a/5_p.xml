<p class="p">The main results of the XWT show that there is a relatively strong link between precipitation and SSM, and it is mainly the in-phase relation, while temperature and SSM is mainly the anti-phase relation, and the link is relatively weak. The in-phase relationship indicates that SM will increase with the increases of precipitation and decrease with the decreases of precipitation, and the anti-phase relationship indicates that the SM will decrease with the increases in temperature and it will increase with the decreases of temperature. We can find that the variation of SSM in the TRB is more influenced by precipitation, and temperature is less effective in affecting of SSM change [
