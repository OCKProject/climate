 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. We notice that SM at 0–10 cm in the desert and precipitation was in-phase with significant common power of 6–8 year band from 1979 to1990. This in-phase relationship indicates that SM will increase with the increases of precipitation and decrease with the decreases of precipitation. Similarly, SM at 0–10 cm in the forest and farmland mainly presented an in-phase relationship with precipitation. However, SM at 0–10 cm in the grassland presents a significant in-phase relationship with precipitation from 1995 to 2001 (

In the TRB, the principal resonant periods of precipitation and SSM in the desert, forest, and farmland are about 6–8 year, with an in-phase relation. The significant main resonant periods of precipitation and SSM in the grassland are about 2–3 years.
