 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, SSM of the different land types have different time lags compared with the variation of precipitation and temperature. The time lags of the SSM relative to the temperature change is significantly longer than its time lags relative to the precipitation change, and the time lags vary from different land types. SM at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm show different time lags compared with the precipitation change, with the lags of about 0.28d–0.87d and 0.07–0.35d, respectively. SM at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm also present different time lags compared with the temperature change, with the lags of about 1.78d–3.01d and 1.30d–3.16d, respectively. The variation of SSM in the TRB is closely related to climate change. Precipitation is a principal and direct sources of SSM, which means the impact of precipitation on the variation of SSM is more direct. However, temperature affects the change of SM by affecting the soil freeze-thaw process and the evaporation of the surface soil layer [

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Therefore, the time lags of SSM relative to temperature changes are longer than its time lags relative to precipitation change.
