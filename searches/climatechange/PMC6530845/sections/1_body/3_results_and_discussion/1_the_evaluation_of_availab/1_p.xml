<p class="p">To further evaluate the availability of GLDAS SM data in the TRB, we calculated the correlation coefficients of GLDAS SM data and observation data (
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We selected the 10 cm and 50 cm observation data to evaluate the GLDAS SM data at 0–10 cm and 10–40 cm. The results of evaluation indicate that the GLDAS SM data present a relatively good correlation with observation data, which means the GLDAS SM data can reflect the temporal variations of SM and are applicable in the TRB. The results are consistent with the research of the assessment of SM data over China that GLDAS SM data have relatively good correlation with observation data and can better describe the seasonal and interannual variations of SM [
