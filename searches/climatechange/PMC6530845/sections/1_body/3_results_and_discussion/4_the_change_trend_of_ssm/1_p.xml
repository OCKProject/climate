<p class="p">The Mann-Kendall test is conducted to examine the change trend of SSM during the study period. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> (under the confidence level of 0.05), it can be seen that the interannual variation of SSM in the forest, grassland, and farmland all present a significant increasing trend. For the seasonal variation, SM at 0–10 cm in the forest, grassland, and farmland show a significant increasing trend in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which are especially greater in the spring and winter. In addition, SM at 10–40 cm in the forest, grassland, farmland, and desert commonly present a significant upward trend in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which are especially greater in the summer. Studies indicate that the precipitation and temperature in the study area has a significant increasing trend during past several decades[
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Precipitation is one important source of SSM [
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], and the increases of temperature will cause the thawing of frozen soil and snow, which are another important source of SSM. So that the increases of SSM in the TRB are closely related to the climatic warming and wetting trend.
