<p class="p">We gathered the earth system data product to solve the problem of lacking observation data, including the SM data and the grid data of precipitation and temperature. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) combines satellite and surface-based meteorological observation data to provide reliable data for the research of SM [

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The GLDAS outputs exist estimated deviations and limitations and can hardly avoid the uncertainties of parameters and the atmospheric driving data, which will make influences on the research results [

GRACE and GLDAS data was used to investigate the variation of terrestrial water storage in the Tianshan Mountains and its surrounding regions, the results indicated that GLDAS data have a good consistency and linear relationship with GRACE data [
