 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For a specific region, the spatiotemporal variation of SM is mainly influenced by the climate change, hydrological cycle, and surface ecosystem. Moreover, SSM is an indicator of eco-hydrological processes and regional climate change. It is mainly affected by temperature, precipitation, sunlight, evaporation, and surface vegetation[

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Scholars have studied the change trend of SM and its relationship with atmospheric circulation, climate change, and NDVI. Precipitation and temperature are the two most important meteorological factors affecting the change of SM. [

However, there have relatively fewer researches about the spatiotemporal variation of SM and its response to the climate change under different land types, especially in Northwest China, a typical arid and semi-arid area in the continental interiors.
