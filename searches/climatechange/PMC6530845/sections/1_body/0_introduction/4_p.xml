<p class="p">To understand the spatiotemporal variation of SSM and its relationship with precipitation and temperature under different land types in Northwest China, we selected the TRB as a typical representative of the data-scarce area in Northwest China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Based on the SM data of GLDAS and the monthly grid data of precipitation and temperature in China to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of SSM and its relationship with precipitation and temperature under different land types from 1961 to 2010 by using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Pearson correlation coefficient and the cross wavelet transform. Soil thickness not only reflects soil development, but also affects soil nutrients, water migration, and the growth of plant root. The average soil thickness in Xinjiang is about 68.9 cm [

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Considering the mountainous with high altitude in the TRB where distributed frozen soil, we took the soil thickness of 48 cm as the reference for the study of SSM. GLDAS SM consists of four layers of 0–10 cm, 10–40 cm, 40–100 cm, 100–200 cm. Therefore, we selected the first two layers of GLDAS SM to investigate the variation of SSM in the TRB. In the following work, we defined the soil depth of 0–40 cm as the shallow soil layer, which means that the SSM refers the SM in the layer with the depth of 0–40 cm.
