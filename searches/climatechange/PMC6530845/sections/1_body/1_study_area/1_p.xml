<p class="p">A typical representative of the data-scarce area in Northwest China, the TRB locates in Xinjiang Province of Northwest China, and it is the largest inland river basin in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217020.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). This basin mainly consists of the Aksu River, Kashi River, Yarkand River, Hotan River, Kaidu River-Konqi River and other main tributaries as well as the mainstream of the Tarim River[

 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The north of the TRB is the Tianshan Mountains, the southwest is the Pamirs and the Karakoram Mountains, the south is the Kunlun Mountain and the Altun Mountains, and the central region is the Taklimakan Desert, consequently generating a closed basin surrounded by high mountains that leads to the relative enclosed ecosystem[
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This river basin belongs to the typical continental climate, with drought climate, rare precipitation, large amount evaporation, limited water resources, and its natural vegetation mainly distributes near the river[
 <xref rid="pone.0217020.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Land types in the north belong to the mountain desert, grassland, and coniferous forest, with the relatively high vegetation coverage. The central region is mainly covered by the desert, its vegetation mainly distributes in the oasis agricultural district and the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River. The vegetation coverage of the western Kunlun Mountains of the south is relatively high, which are mainly grassland and alpine vegetation [
