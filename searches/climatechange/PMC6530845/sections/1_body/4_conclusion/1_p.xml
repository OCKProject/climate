<p class="p">We investigated the spatiotemporal variation of SSM in different land types and its responses to the climate change in the TRB based on the GLDAS SM data and the grid data of precipitation and temperature in China. This research used the Mann-Kendall test to examine the change trend of SSM, and also used the Pearson correlation coefficient and cross wavelet transform to explore the relationship and time lags of SSM relative to the variation of precipitation and temperature. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the low-value of SSM distributes in the Taklamakan Desert, whereas the high-value of SSM mainly distributes in Pamirs and the southern foothill of Tianshan Mountains, where the land types are mainly forest, grassland, and farmland. (2) Annual average SSM and seasonal SSM of the forest, grassland, and farmland all present a significant increasing trend during the study period. (3) SM at 0–10 cm of all land types are positively correlated to precipitation in spring and autumn, and SM at 0–10 cm in the forest, grassland, and farmland are positively correlated with temperature in winter. (4) SSM presents in-phase relation with precipitation whereas it presents anti-phase relation with temperature, with the significant resonance periods, with the periods about 6–8 years and 2–3 years respectively. (5) The significantly related periods of SSM and precipitation are mainly from1970s to early 1990s, and its significantly related periods with temperature are mainly around 1960s. (6) The time lags of SSM relative to temperature change are longer than its time lags relative to precipitation change, and it varies from different land types.</p>
