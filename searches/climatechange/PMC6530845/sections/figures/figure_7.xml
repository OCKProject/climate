  <title class="title">The cross wavelet transform of precipitation and SM (10–40 cm).</title>
  <p class="p">(The area surrounded by the thick black line indicates the 5% significance level against red noise and the cone of influence (COI) with edge effects is shown as a lighter shade. Arrows presents the relative phase relationships between precipitation and SM, where the right direction means in-phase, the left direction means anti-phase, and up direction indicates that precipitation leading SM by 90°. The land types are (a) desert, (b) forest, (c) grassland, and (d) farmland.).</p>
