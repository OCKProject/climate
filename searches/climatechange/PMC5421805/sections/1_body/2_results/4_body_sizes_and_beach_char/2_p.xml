<p class="p">The results of multiple regression analyses (forward stepwise) with Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), showed that in most cases, the inclusion of SST, resulted in a better model to predict body sizes than the null model or those obtained by using only beach characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177116.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The analyses run with the December 1998—January 1999 data, showed that surf zone SST was the most important predictor of body size in almost all cases; surf zone SST resulted in a better model to predict body sizes of the largest males and females of
