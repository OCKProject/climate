<p class="p">We found some evidence of relationships between the body sizes of crustacean populations and beach characteristics, particularly for the mid shore isopods. The body sizes of males of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">braziliensis</italic> were correlated with beach face slopes (body size = 11.389 - (0.133 x slope), r = 0.84, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.016, df = 22), females of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">braziliensis</italic> with sediment size (body size = 14.161 - (2.738 x sediment size), r = 0.91, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.005, df = 22) and sediment index (body size = 11.471 - (0.537 x sediment index), r = 0.76, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.050, df = 22) and males of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hirsuticauda</italic> with sediment sorting (body size = 14.034 - (14.606 x sorting), r = 0.89, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.042, df = 22). In general, relationships between body sizes of crustacean populations and beach morphodynamic state (Dean’s parameter) were not significant for data collected in Chile. However, we found a significant relationship between the size of the largest ovigerous females of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">analoga</italic> and Dean’s parameter (body size = 18.557 + (1.177 x Dean’s), r = 0.51, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.014, df = 22).
