<p class="p">Results of our analysis of the potential consequences of changes in body size on reproductive output varied between the crab and isopod, with stronger effects for the larger-sized crab. Through the effects of sea-surface temperature on body size, an increase of 2°C was estimated to result in a moderate ~10% decline in fecundity of

An increase in SST of 2°C could thus result in a reduction of body mass of ~71% for crabs from Chile and ~49% for Californian crabs, with corresponding decreases in fecundity of ~68% and ~60%, respectively (
