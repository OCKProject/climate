<p class="p">Sea-surface temperature (SST) measured at the surf zone at the time of population sampling (summer) and values derived from satellite imagery decreased significantly with increasing latitude in the study regions in both hemispheres (

Overall, sea-surface temperatures at beaches sampled in our study spanned about a third of the range of temperatures present along the eastern shores of the Pacific Ocean (9.5° C of approximately 30° C) [
