<p class="p">To investigate macroscale patterns of intraspecific variation in body size of widely distributed species in relation to latitude and water temperature, we compared populations of ecologically important intertidal crustaceans of sandy beaches along the Chilean and Californian coasts. To expand the generality of our analyses and explore hypotheses concerning the responses of body size for taxa that occupy different tidal zones and differ in feeding and developmental mode, we compared four species that were representative of the broader intertidal community. Species selected for study included a high-shore detritivore, the talitrid amphipod, 
 <italic class="italic">Orchestoidea tuberculata</italic> (Nicolet), and two mid-shore scavenging cirolanid isopods, 
 <italic class="italic">Excirolana hirsuticauda</italic> Menzies 
 <italic class="italic">and E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">braziliensis</italic> Richardson from Chile, and a swash-zone-dwelling suspension-feeding hippid crab, 
 <italic class="italic">Emerita analoga</italic>, from both Chile and California.
