Intertidal communities of sandy beaches along Chile and California have similar trophic structure and are both taxonomically dominated by mobile crustaceans including talitrid amphipods, cirolanid isopods and anomuran crabs, that make up a high proportion of community abundance and biomass in both hemispheres [

 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Many of these characteristic intertidal invertebrate taxa occupy broad latitudinal ranges on beaches along the coasts of Chile and California, creating an excellent opportunity to evaluate hypotheses concerning macroscale patterns in body size with respect to latitude and ocean temperatures, and to gain potential insights on coastal ecosystem responses to climate change.
