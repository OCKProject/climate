<p class="p">Broadly distributed intertidal marine species or taxa, whose distributional ranges include a wide span of environmental variability, may be less vulnerable to extinction from the effects of climate change than those with restricted ranges. However, body size, life history and other attributes of these wide-ranging coastal taxa (e.g. [

At a population level these attributes are useful for exploring potential responses to climate change that could carry implications for communities, food webs and ecosystem functioning and provide valuable information for use in conservation strategies. Substitution of space-for-time in comparisons of contemporary macroscale patterns in coastal species may also provide useful new insights on population-level responses to temperature change for a wider range of species and ecosystems, particularly those for which sources of long-term data are insufficient or lacking [

 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. These types of spatial comparisons along environmental gradients may also potentially be less affected by environmental or anthropogenic drivers that operate over longer time scales.
