Although the absolute rate of warming may be slower in the ocean, marine ecosystems may change very rapidly in response to climate forcing [

Predicting ecological responses to the effects of altered water and air temperatures, sea level rise, coastal squeeze, storminess and acidification on organismal, population and community processes is particularly important for coastal ecosystems which occupy a narrow strip at the edge of land and sea [
