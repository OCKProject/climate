<p class="p">Sandy beaches are the most widely represented coastal ecosystem along the temperate coasts of the Eastern Pacific and much of the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, as narrow fringing ecosystems, beaches are at particular risk of significant impacts from global climate change, sea level rise and coastal development, yet studies of potential ecological responses of these highly dynamic but vulnerable coastal ecosystems to climate forcing are remarkably sparse [

 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However the unique and highly mobile intertidal fauna of sandy beaches [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] makes these often overlooked coastal ecosystems ideal for investigating ecological responses to global climate change. In contrast to the sessile or sedentary intertidal organisms of rocky or muddy shores, the intertidal animals of sandy beaches actively move up and down the shore to adjust to tide and wave conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This attribute makes possible geographic comparisons that are relatively unaffected by differences in tidal height among sites or by additional potentially confounding factors associated with latitude and other factors [
