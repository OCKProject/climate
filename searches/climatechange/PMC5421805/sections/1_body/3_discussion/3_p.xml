<p class="p">The similar responses we observed in the size at settlement (megalopae) and adult body sizes of the hippid crab,

At settlement the megalopal post larvae transition from the plankton to the intertidal beach, then spend up to one month in the intertidal at the same size before molting to become juvenile crabs [
