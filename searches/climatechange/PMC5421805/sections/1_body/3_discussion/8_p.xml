<p class="p">Importantly, our comparisons suggest that changes in ocean temperatures of even a few degrees °C associated with global warming or other climatic variability are likely to have significant effects on body size (~4% - 35% length °C
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) in marine intertidal populations. Further, the variation in body size associated with an increase of 2°C in sea-surface temperatures resulted in proportional effects on individual biomass (49–71%) and fecundity (10% - 68%) of these species with stronger effects on the larger crab species. Even assuming population densities are constant, such effects of altered body size have consequences for population biomass, reproductive output and demography that carry implications for the structure and function of the affected communities and ecosystems. For example, the crab,

 <italic class="italic">analoga</italic>, often comprises the majority (&gt;50%) of the intertidal biomass on sandy beaches and represents an important prey resource for birds and fish [

Thus, reductions in body size and altered population characteristics of this species predicted in response to increased temperature would also significantly reduce overall intertidal community biomass and affect the ecosystem function of food-web support for coastal birds and fish, including species of conservation significance. Talitrid amphipods, such as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tuberculata</italic>, are important intertidal consumers of stranded macroalgal wrack, playing a key role in the breakdown and remineralization of this subsidy from coastal reefs and kelp forests worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Changes in the size structure of these populations can strongly affect rates of consumption and processing of macroalgae and the ecosystem function of beaches in coastal nutrient cycling [
