<p class="p">For ectotherms such as intertidal invertebrates, increased temperature can be associated with greater metabolic costs for maintenance, leaving less energy available for both growth and reproduction (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]). In crustaceans, warm water temperatures can accelerate ovarian maturation, causing ovarian and somatic growth to become antagonistic (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]), resulting in smaller sizes at maturity and maximum body sizes [

Although trends of higher productivity with increasing latitude have been described for both the Chilean and Californian coasts (e.g. [
