Integration across the responses of individual species in a community or ecosystem can provide a greater understanding of potential ecological effects of climate change that extends beyond a population or metapopulation level [

Our results showing similar responses in the body size of several important intertidal species to temperature for the widespread coastal ecosystem of sandy beaches illustrate the importance of such considerations not only for ecology, but also for conservation and management.
