<p class="p">Our analyses demonstrate consistent macro-scale patterns of body size for broadly distributed intertidal animals of sandy beach ecosystems in the northern and southern hemispheres of the eastern Pacific coast. Body size increases towards higher latitudes and decreases as sea-surface temperature increases for ecologically important species spanning different trophic groups and life histories. Although our results, and those of Dugan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], suggest that local habitat features that do not vary with latitude (e.g. beach morphodynamic type) may also contribute to variation in body size in some life stages, most of the variation observed in body size of these intertidal crustaceans was best explained by surf zone water temperature alone.
