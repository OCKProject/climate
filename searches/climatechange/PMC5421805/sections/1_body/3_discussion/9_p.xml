<p class="p">In summary, alterations in ocean temperatures associated with global climate change are expected to strongly affect the body size of intertidal ectotherms, with consequences extending from populations to ecosystem functions and services. The consistency of our results on body size across species with different life histories, feeding modes and microhabitats inhabiting a single coastal ecosystem, and for one species, across hemispheres, suggests that there is potential to generalize predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change with important implications for conservation. Finally, our results illustrate the potential for the use of appropriately designed and constrained space-for-time substitutions across an ecological community to increase our understanding of the effects of global climate change on broadly distributed populations and communities of coastal ecosystems, particularly those for which robust time series data are not available.</p>
