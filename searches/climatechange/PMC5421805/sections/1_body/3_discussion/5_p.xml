<p class="p">Importantly, our results, which extend across co-occurring crustacean species that utilize distinctly different food resources and experience very different levels of submergence by seawater, imply that mechanisms affecting body size can operate in a similar or complementary manner across different functional groups and microhabitats. The mechanisms that drive observed macroscale patterns in body size, and the responses of any particular species, taxon, or group to environmental variation, can be complex and highly context dependent [

 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. A variety of environmental mechanisms have been proposed to explain observed patterns of larger body sizes of marine invertebrates towards colder waters. These include spatial variability in water temperature (e.g. [

Biotic processes that can co-vary with latitude, such as predation, have also been shown to influence body size patterns in marine invertebrates but the majority of studies, including ours, do not address this potential mechanism separately [
