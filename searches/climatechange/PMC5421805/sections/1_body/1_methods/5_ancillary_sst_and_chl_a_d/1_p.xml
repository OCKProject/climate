<p class="p">For SST, we used daily 0.25°-resolution Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Satellite data from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information portal (

We extracted and averaged daily data for pixels having centres within 35 km of the recorded coordinates for each beach site for the periods of 1 Jan 1998 to 31 Dec 2000 (Chile) and 1 Jan 1986 to 31 Dec 1986 (California). For Chlorophyll-a, we used 0.1°-resolution SeaWiFS monthly means from NOAA’s ERDDAP servers (

We extracted and averaged these data for areas spanning 0.5° (latitude and longitude) centered on the coordinates for each beach. Chlorophyll-a data were available only for the Chilean surveys because the California surveys predated the SeaWiFS satellite. For each beach, the mean (Mean), minimum (Min) and Maximum (Max) sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (CHLa) were tabulated for the years of each of the survey periods (1986 (California SST only), 1998–1999 (Chile), 1999–2000 (Chile).
