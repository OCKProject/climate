<p class="p">Multiple regression analyses (forward stepwise) were used to examine whether composite indices of beach features (sediment index and Dean´s parameter) produced better predictions of body size than surf zone water temperature (SST) for the body size data collected during December 1998- January 1999 and b) life history characteristics of

 <italic class="italic">analoga</italic>, and environmental variables (summer 1999–2000). The resulting models were compared with the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) using R [
 <xref rid="pone.0177116.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. We first fit an intercept-only model as a Null or starting model then allowed the routine to try all possible predictors one at a time, until no more predictors can be added then we picked the model that yielded the lowest AICc. This procedure was repeated for each intertidal crustacean species and each life history characteristic of
