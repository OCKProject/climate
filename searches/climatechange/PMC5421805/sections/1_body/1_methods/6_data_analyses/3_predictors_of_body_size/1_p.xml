<p class="p">After exploring the possible presence of spatial autocorrelation in our data, we used simple OLS (ordinary least squares) regression analysis to evaluate possible relationships between body sizes of the life stages of the species studied and latitude and surf zone water temperature (SST). For each fitted model, we inspected the residuals visually, using standard diagnostic plots to assess violations of model assumptions. Almost without exception, we found little evidence of severe heteroscedasticity, trends or non-normality among residuals (bearing in mind that sample sizes are small). In the rare instances where such violations were observed, we decided to retain the linear model fit for the sake of consistency. In this small number of cases, our estimated model fit would be slightly worse than it might have been, had we resorted to a transformation of the response, and this only serves to render our results slightly conservative (i.e., we err on the side of Type-II errors, so we do not report spurious relationships as a result of our decision).</p>
