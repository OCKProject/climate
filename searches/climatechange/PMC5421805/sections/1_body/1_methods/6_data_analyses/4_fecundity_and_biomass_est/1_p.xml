<p class="p">To illustrate the potential consequences of changes in body size on reproductive output and biomass, we used the body size and temperature relationships we obtained to calculate the proportional change in size predicted for mid-sized females at 16°C (the median surf zone SST) as a function of changes in sea-surface temperature ranging from +2°C to -2°C in one degree increments. We then used these proportional changes in body size of a mid-sized female (8.5 mm) to estimate associated changes in 1) fecundity of the direct-developing brooding isopod
