 <italic class="italic">analoga</italic> included: body size of the largest male, body size of the smallest and largest ovigerous females, size at maturity of female crabs, and size at settlement (mean size of megalopae; California coast only). The smallest size of ovigerous females corresponded to the 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile size determined from the cumulative number of crabs, while largest size of ovigerous female and male crabs corresponded to the 95
