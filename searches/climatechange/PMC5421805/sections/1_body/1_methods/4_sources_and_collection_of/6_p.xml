<p class="p">We also measured the physical features of beaches that could potentially influence intertidal biota and/or exhibit latitudinal variability, such as grain size, beach face slope and beach morphodynamic types (see below). Sediment samples for grain-size analysis were collected in Chile with a 3.5-cm diameter plastic core from the uppermost 4 cm of sand of the effluent line and from the lowest swash level. These samples were analyzed with an Emery settling tube. The morphology of each sampling site (

Wave height was estimated by measuring the height of breaking waves (n = 10) with graduated poles against the horizon, and adding the result to the height difference between the location of the observer and the lowest point where the backwash met the next incoming swash bore. The wave period (measured with a stop watch) was the average time interval between breaking waves. Details for the corresponding methods employed on the Californian coast were similar [
