<p class="p">Lakes constitute ca. 2.8% of Earth's land surface area
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, yet they serve as critical resources for society by providing water for drinking, hygiene, industry, power generation and recreation. Lakes are also hot spots of biodiversity and are often sensitive indicators of environmental changes, both regional and global. The interconnectedness of lakes to their surrounding environmentsâ€”the habitats they provide and biodiversity they hold, along with society's heavy reliance on their resources makes managing any resultant effects of environmental change important. To assess and subsequently mitigate potential impacts of current environmental change (that is, climate change) on ecosystem function

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>, it is essential to know how lakes have responded to past environmental changes. This is primarily accomplished through the reconstruction of paleolimnological trends using lake sediment core records. This is especially useful in systems where historical records are lacking.
