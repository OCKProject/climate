<p class="p">The most salient feature in all sediment cores is the abrupt increase in bulk productivity proxy indicators over the last century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The increase occurs more rapidly than at any other time period in the record(s) presented (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figs 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">3</xref>). The general pattern observed in the bulk sediment carbon isotope values (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub>) for all cores is a period of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-enrichment (ca. 2‰) beginning near 1900AD and continuing until present day. The timing of the increase in both TOC and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub> varies among the core sites. Overall, the cores nearer to shore and in shallower water depths show slightly later increases than those that are farther off-shore and in mid-to-deep water depths.
