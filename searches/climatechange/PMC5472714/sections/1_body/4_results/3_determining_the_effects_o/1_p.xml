<p class="p">To account for the role of diagenesis in altering the sedimentary record (that is, TOC mineralization) we constructed steady-state diagenetic models that were then compared with observed profiles. The modelled profiles are concordant with our measured TOC profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, TOC concentrations, when considered alone, must be interpreted with caution (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). In Lake Ontario, post-burial diagenesis reduced the organic carbon content within sediment cores taken 6 years apart, but it did not significantly alter the isotopic (δ

 <sub class="sub">org</sub>) composition

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, supporting the interpretation that δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub> values reliably record the primary signal (changes in PP) despite OM loss. Consequently, our focus turns to interpretation of the δ

 <sub class="sub">org</sub> record. Additional studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> have similarly shown that isotopic discrimination associated with (re)mineralization has a negligible influence on δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub> within oxic, low organic content sediments like Lake Superior. Therefore, diagenesis provides an unconvincing explanation for the overall

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-enrichment documented in the last century in Lake Superior.
