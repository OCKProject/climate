<p class="p">Lake Superior is Earth's largest freshwater lake by surface area and third largest by volume. Despite its prominence, both regionally and globally, documenting the duration and extent of environmental change in Lake Superior is often difficult because of the paucity of historical data, notably for primary production (PP). While details of the lake's primary productivity rates and nutrient cycles are still debated
