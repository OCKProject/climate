<p class="p">To augment historical records and establish a baseline of PP in Lake Superior, we present a ca. 9000-year (paleo)productivity record from three piston and corresponding gravity sediment cores taken from across the lake basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). (Paleo)productivity proxy data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref> (total organic carbon—TOC, atomic ratio of organic carbon to nitrogen—C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub>:N, and the stable isotope composition of organic carbon—δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub>) from these cores provide a historic baseline for our assessment of current productivity trends inferred from eight sediment multicores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The use of such proxies to reconstruct PP is based on the premise that increases in lacustrine productivity should lead to increases in the deposition of TOC along with changes in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub>. In general, the relationship between the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C of primary photosynthate and the extent of PP reflects the response of isotopic fractionation during carbon fixation to variations in the concentration of aqueous CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>). Essentially, 
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>C is more energetically favourable in the assimilation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> during photosynthesis. As photosynthesis increases, reserves of 
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>C within the water column become depleted and discrimination of 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C is reduced. As a result, δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub> values are typically 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-enriched (depleted) with increasing (decreasing) PP. Thus, changes in TOC and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">org</sub> can be used as a proxy for changes in lacustrine (paleo)productivity.
