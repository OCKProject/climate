Gravity cores were also taken as trigger cores corresponding to each of the three piston cores, providing a more complete sediment core record. Eight sediment multicores, designed to capture the sediment water interface, were collected aboard the R/V Blue Heron and one aboard the R/V Lake Guardian from each basin of Lake Superior (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>); one in 2003 (BH03-3), three in 2009 (BH09-2, BH09-3 and BH09-4) and four in 2010 (LG MC, IR MC, EM MC and CM MC). Core sites were identified using a Knudsen 12 kHz Hi-Res echo sounder and a CHIRP seismic reflection profiler onboard the R/V Blue Heron. The coring sites were chosen based on evidence of uninterrupted stratigraphy resulting from continuous sedimentation to characterize representative locations in Lake Superior. The LG MC core was collected aboard the R/V Lake Guardian using an Ocean Instruments model 750 box corer (30 cm × 30 cm × 90 cm), from which two 6.5 cm internal diameter cylindrical cores were sub-sampled. The rest of the multicores were collected with an Ocean Instruments model MC-400 multi-corer (9.4 cm diameter) from water depths listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Initial core description and splitting were performed at the National Lacustrine Core Repository (LacCore). Subsamples were taken from each multicore at 0.5 cm intervals to 10 cm and every 1 cm thereafter to the base of the core and from each piston and accompanying gravity (trigger) core at 10 cm intervals to the base of the core. Sediment samples were subsequently frozen and freeze-dried for geochemical analyses.
