<p class="p">TOC and total nitrogen abundances of bulk sedimentary OM were analysed for weight percent C and N concurrently with isotope ratio determinations. All concentrations are presented for acid fumigated (decarbonated) samples, eliminating variability caused by carbonate concentrations within samples. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> peak areas (Isodat v3.0) were converted to weight percent compositions using response factors generated from standards of known composition (acetanilide, caffeine, B-2153, B-2159 and urea), which were run between every ten samples. Analytical precision, based on replicate standard runs for bulk measurements, was typically better than ±0.70% on average for carbon and nitrogen weight % values and better than ±0.25‰ on average for carbon isotope values. Reproducibility between duplicate samples was better than ±0.05% for both carbon and nitrogen weight % values; reproducibility of carbon isotopic values between duplicates was better than ±0.07‰. Analyses were performed at the Large Lakes Observatory (LLO) Stable Isotope Lab using a Costech Elemental Analyzer coupled with a ThermoFinnigan Delta
 <sup class="sup">plus</sup>XP stable isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Every tenth sample was run in duplicate. Carbon isotopic (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) values are reported relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite in conventional delta notation as per mil (‰) deviations.
