<p class="p">Age/depth relationships for gravity cores were developed using linear extrapolation from the bottom of corresponding multicores (SR—BH09-4, KW—BH09-2 and IR—IR MC), which had previous 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb age assignments, as described above. Extrapolation from the 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb age model of the multicores to the gravity cores makes the assumption that the gravity cores begin where multicores end. Although not an ideal assumption, this is a valid approach as it provides a conservative age model, in addition to the fact that over penetration of the sediment/water interface is common when recovering both gravity and piston cores whereas multicores are designed to capture the sediment/water interface.
