 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb activity should be negligible at depth, where sediment age is likely to exceed 150 years (&gt;6 half-lives). The cores were not analysed for Cs-137 because the Cs-137 peak may fall at an age younger than the time of maximum atmospheric concentration due to a lag in Cs-137 transport to its final depositional site via resuspension, transport and re-deposition in the Laurentian Great Lakes

The MAR for this zone is assumed to be constant, and equal to that derived from the slope of the line segment immediately below the bioturbation zone. An excursion occurs in core BH09-4 between 3 and 7 cm and is attributed to the effects of taconite ore processing beginning in 1955, with court-ordered reductions in effect by 1980; therefore, MARs for this portion are assumed to be equivalent to the slope of the segment immediately above this disturbance, but below the bioturbation zone. The
