<p class="p">Homogenized dry sediment samples of known weight (12–20 mg) were placed into silver (Ag) foil capsules in designated sample trays and 1 μl of nanopure filtered H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O was dispensed into each sample capsule. Sample trays were then placed in a desiccator, sans desiccant, with 12 M HCl for 8 h to remove inorganic carbon from the sediment (acid fumigation). Upon removal, samples were allowed to off-gas residual HCl while being dried on a hotplate set at 60 °C; drying time was on the order of 12 h. In order to ensure dryness, samples were additionally placed in an oven set at 60 °C overnight. Dried samples were then folded in tin (Sn) foil capsules.
