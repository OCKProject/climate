<p class="p">There is some variability in the timing of the most recent increase in PP among the multicores presented here. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the lake (and all large lakes), one may not expect a simultaneous basin-wide response. Lake surface water temperature is not constant across the spatial extent of the lake, but varies considerably based on factors such as water depth, physical circulation patterns and ice-cover. Furthermore, the extent of warming and decrease in ice cover in recent years have both varied across the lake basin (ref.
