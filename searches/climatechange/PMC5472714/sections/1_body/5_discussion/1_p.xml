 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>). Over time a steady, low-level delivery of both elements to the lake would slowly increase the amount of each to the recycled pool (Fe and P are rapidly recycled in the water column) and allow for a sustained increase in PP. Increases in nitrate concentrations likely helped to fuel initial PP in the lake; however, the continuous build-up throughout the last century and extremely high N:P ratios at present
