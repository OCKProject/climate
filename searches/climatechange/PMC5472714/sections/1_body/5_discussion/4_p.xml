 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> suggest there has been little variation in the relative composition of algal divisions in Lake Superior; thus it is assumed that the mechanism(s) of carbon assimilation and metabolism have not changed significantly over the last century. Additionally, while diatoms make up a large proportion of the phytoplankton community in Lake Superior

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Furthermore, the subtle changes in algal divisions that have been documented are likely the result of warming water temperatures and accompanied by changes in water quality
