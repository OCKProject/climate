<p class="p">It is clear from data presented here that the increase in PP within the last century has not been experienced previously in Lake Superior and that past changes in climate regime(s), including abrupt climate changes, were not as influential as those today. For example, a ca. 200-year period of cooling that could have reduced algal productivity (the so-called 8.2 ka event

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>); exhibiting the warmest 50-year period of Northern Hemisphere mean annual temperature before 1900AD (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>)), or the Little Ice Age (1400–1900AD (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>)). Sampling resolution of the piston cores is approximately every 100 years—which should capture such events if present. Additionally, warmer mid-Holocene regional summer air temperatures were offset by cooler winter air temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>, presumably resulting in greater ice-cover. In contrast, the rate of anthropogenic warming is much faster and acts as a positive feedback increasing in-lake temperatures faster than the surrounding air, thereby decreasing ice-cover and increasing the length of the stratified ‘growing' season in Lake Superior

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Even though past climate perturbations are not apparent in the (paleo)productivity record presented here, it is likely that the rate at which the most recent environmental and climate changes have occurred has overcome the buffering capacity of Lake Superior's large volume, allowing for recent changes to become manifest as increases in productivity. These observations suggest that anthropogenic influences are becoming increasingly important and are of significance as the great lakes of the world are considered less susceptible to anthropogenic changes (climate or otherwise) than their smaller counterparts.
