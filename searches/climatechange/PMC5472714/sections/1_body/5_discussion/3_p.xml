<p class="p">Arguably, the two major sources of inorganic carbon to Lake Superior are atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> influx (owing to its large surface area; ∼82,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from rivers and streams. Lake Δ
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">DIC</sub> tracks atmospheric Δ
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">CO2</sub> values rather than riverine Δ
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">DIC</sub> values
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Therefore, changes in watershed factors such as soil respiration that could influence lake DIC δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values through time are likely negligible.
