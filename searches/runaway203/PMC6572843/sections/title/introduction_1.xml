 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In nonlinear systems one can often observe qualitative differences in the asymptotic behavior belonging to different parameter sets. Bifurcations, instabilities, catastrophes can occur
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Such phase transition-like phenomena are found even in low-dimensional dynamical systems. There is an increasing interest in the dynamics of systems subjected to a 
  <span class="italic">time-dependent change</span> of the parameter sets, a phenomenon called parameter drifts, or ramping. Within the realm of such problems, tipping phenomena, i.e. dramatic changes in the asymptotic and transient behaviour, are of special interest, and are found in different branches of sciences

  </span>, where qualitatively different stable asymptotic states coexist for a given set of parameters and/or forcings. Such systems often exhibit bifurcations when a parameter is varied. If a parameter is slowly drifting, bifurcations leading to tipping occur often with a delay depending on the rate of the drift

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results, supported by rigorous arguments, are found in systems exhibiting only fixed point attractors (equilibria). Furthermore, tipping is usually considered from the perspective of an individual trajectory starting on one attractor and ending on a different one. The case of periodic attractors has been included only recently
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> showed that for periodic attractors partial tipping can occur in the sense that certain phases of the periodic attractor tip and others do not.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our aim is to investigate what kind of tipping phenomena might occur in typical dynamical systems, also possessing chaotic dynamics, or more generally, systems with topological complexity. Ott and coworkers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> were the first to study this problem, but only for very slow parameter drifts. We consider the interesting case where no time-scale separation occurs and hence qualitative changes in the dynamics cannot be interpreted as bifurcation-induced tippings. In such cases one cannot hope for analytic results, therefore, we report numerical findings obtained in a paradigmatic model whose behaviour characterizes deterministic nonautonomous low-dimensional dissipative dynamical systems. It was shown in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> that in systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, full tracking is impossible, the attractors obtained in the classical bifurcation diagram (which corresponds to an infinitely slow parameter drift) are never similar to the actual attractors in the range of non-negligible rates. For distinction, we will use the term “frozen-in” for systems with fixed parameters. We show that due to the strong internal variability of such complex systems, 
  <span class="italic">tipping probabilities</span> should be used as measures of tipping. Thus, partial tipping
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> proves to be the rule rather than the exception. Where chaotic attractors exist, 
  <span class="italic">tipping into chaotic attractors</span> and 
  <span class="italic">tipping from or through chaotic attractors</span> can occur, and we find that even initially arbitrarily close trajectories tip into different attractors, resulting in a completely random tipping due to the appearance of riddled-like basins of attraction. In transitions between two qualitatively different regular attractors, 
  <span class="italic">fractality-induced tipping</span> takes place characterized by a refined dependence on the particular scenario, as a consequence of the ubiquitous presence of fractal basin boundaries. A less apparent effect of underlying transient chaos is 
  <span class="italic">transient-reduced tipping</span> characterized by a reduction of the probabilities when tipping processes are studied on finite observation times, a frequent situation in research. We find rate-induced tippings appearing in form in which tipping probabilities increase gradually from zero when the rate is increased. This is in contrast to the sharp transitions recorded on the level of individual trajectories in systems lacking topological complexity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. We conclude that the existence of chaotic motion leads to a multitude of new tipping phenomena induced by topological complexity.
