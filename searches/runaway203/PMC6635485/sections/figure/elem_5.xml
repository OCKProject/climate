  <p>Seasonal mean (July - September) precipitation anomalies (mm•day
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) obtained from (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) aeroffEL-aeroffCL simulation, indicating reduced rainfall during El Niño than climatology when no aerosols were introduced, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) aeronEL-aeronCL simulation, indicating reduced rainfall during El Niño relative to climatology when aerosols were introduced. Comparison of 
   <span class="bold">a,b</span> indicates that aerosols have increased the scarcity of drought in El Niño simulation. A schematic depicts aerosol distribution in the ATAL during (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) normal and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) co-occurring El Niño simulation. Vertical transport of sulfate aerosols from East Asian during El Niño is shown in (
   <span class="bold">d</span>). (
   <span class="bold">a,b</span> created using the COLA/GrADS software and 
   <span class="bold">c,d</span>) plotted using NCL and 3D effect and schematic designs created using Adobe illustrator).
