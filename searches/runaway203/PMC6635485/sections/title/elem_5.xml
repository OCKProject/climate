To avoid the effect of pre-monsoon aerosols, we started the model integration from 21 May to 31 May to generate ten ensemble members. The model was spun up for one month, and analysis is presented for the monsoon season (July–September). The simulations were performed for the year 2003 since it was a normal monsoon rainfall year and there was no Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or El Niño. The anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are from the year 2000 RETRO project dataset (available at

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In four sets of experiments, namely, aeronCL, aeroffCL, aeronEL and aeroffEL the model is forced with a monthly varying climatological SST as a lower boundary condition. The monthly climatological SST is derived from HadISST (Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature) for the period 1979–2010. For the aeronEL, and aeroffEL, El Niño experiments, the model is forced with SSTs typical of an El Niño (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Specifically, the SSTs for the El Niño experiments are obtained by imposing monthly SST anomalies of 1997 (for April-September) only in the tropical Pacific region (110–90 °W, 20 °S–20°N) on climatological SSTs (see Fig.

Also, the Niño-3 index must be more than the threshold value (&gt;0.5) from June to September. In our analysis, we considered monsoon season of the co-occurring El Niño year since lead-lag correlations between all Indian summer monsoon rainfall and Niño-3 index exhibits a maximum negative correlation for zero lag year (details are documented previously)

This can be due to various factors such as uncertainties in (i) aerosol emission inventories, (ii) model representation of transport and chemistry processes, or (iii) satellite scattering ratio measurements (e.g. cloud filtering).
