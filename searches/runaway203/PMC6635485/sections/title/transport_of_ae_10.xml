 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of black carbon and dust aerosols in the troposphere (860 hPa) and mid-troposphere (500 hPa) from aeronCL and aeronEL simulations is illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>. We mention that the distribution of organic carbon and sulfate is similar to that of black carbon. The model simulations show higher amounts of these aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plains in the lower troposphere for El Niño simulations than climatology (Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> has shown that, over the timescale of a week, the rainfall over central India (16.5–26.5°N, 74.5–86.6°E) is positively correlated with the concentration of natural aerosols such as desert dust and sea salt over the Arabian Sea. All these further indicate the importance and complexity of aerosols in modulating the Indian monsoon.
