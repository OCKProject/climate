 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of the fact that the spatial variations of the scattering ratio reproduced reasonably well (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), the model overestimated its magnitude. This can be due to various factors such as uncertainties in (i) aerosol emission inventories, (ii) model representation of transport and chemistry processes, or (iii) satellite scattering ratio measurements (e.g. cloud filtering). Comparison of simulated AOD with MISR observations (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>) indicates that the model under-estimates AOD (~0.1) over the Thar desert, Iran, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan and overestimates (~0.3) over the Arabian Sea. Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7a,b</a> shows seasonal mean rainfall for climatology and El Niño simulations. The model reproduces the El Niño related deficit rainfall: the comparison of simulated Niño related rainfall anomalies over the Indian region indicates that spatial pattern of simulated rainfall is in reasonable agreement with GPCP and TRMM observations, although simulated rainfall is underestimated in the model (~4–6 mm•day
