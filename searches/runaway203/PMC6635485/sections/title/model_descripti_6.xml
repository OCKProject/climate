 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We perform sensitivity experiments using state of the art ECHAM5-HAMMOZ aerosol-chemistry-climate model. The model comprises an atmospheric general circulation module, ECHAM5

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model simulations were performed at spectral resolution T42 corresponding to 2.8° × 2.8° in horizontal and 31 vertical levels from surface to 10 hPa with a time step of 20 minutes. To avoid the effect of pre-monsoon aerosols, we started the model integration from 21 May to 31 May to generate ten ensemble members. The model was spun up for one month, and analysis is presented for the monsoon season (July–September). The simulations were performed for the year 2003 since it was a normal monsoon rainfall year and there was no Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or El Niño. The anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are from the year 2000 RETRO project dataset (available at

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In four sets of experiments, namely, aeronCL, aeroffCL, aeronEL and aeroffEL the model is forced with a monthly varying climatological SST as a lower boundary condition. The monthly climatological SST is derived from HadISST (Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature) for the period 1979–2010. For the aeronEL, and aeroffEL, El Niño experiments, the model is forced with SSTs typical of an El Niño (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Specifically, the SSTs for the El Niño experiments are obtained by imposing monthly SST anomalies of 1997 (for April-September) only in the tropical Pacific region (110–90 °W, 20 °S–20°N) on climatological SSTs (see Fig.

  </span>). In aeronAMIP and aeroffAMIP experiments (2005–2016) the model is forced with monthly varying SST and meteorology.
