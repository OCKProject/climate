 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ECHAM5-HAMMOZ is utilised to understand the role of the elevated aerosol layer in exacerbating the severity of monsoon droughts during El Niño. The observed changes can be attributed to the changes in aerosol fields. The increase in industrial emissions from India and China adds millions of metric tons of aerosol into the atmosphere

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, aerosol loadings over South Asia are still expected to remain large at least until the end of the 2040 s. Thus, the more extreme El Niño events, in a background of rising aerosol emission will have an adverse impact on the severity of droughts over the monsoon region. Another important aspect is that the distinct role of aerosols during the pre-monsoon and the monsoon season in the presence of El Niño. While pre-monsoon aerosol loading over North India and the TP reduces the severity of drought

  </span>, aerosol increases during the monsoon enhance it.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While highlighting the complex relationship between droughts, El Niño and aerosols, the present study addresses the potential consequences of simultaneous occurrence of multiple adverse climate drivers (El Niño and aerosols) which may amplify the severity of meteorological phenomena in the present day climate. The plains of North–Central India are under hydrological stress
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> and already exposed to the vulnerability of hydrological extremes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. The increase in the severity of droughts accompanied with El Niño has a profound societal impact that can dry the whole of Central India, affecting agriculture and the livelihood of millions of people. It is well known that reducing aerosol emissions is essential from an air quality perspective, but here we highlight its additional effects on the regional monsoon hydro-climate. These two benefits of decreased pollution levels would promise a better future and would help to avoid negative consequences for millions of lives.
