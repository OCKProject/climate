 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The El Niño itself leads to a decrease in rainfall over India (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>), with a suppressed rainfall during the summer season estimated at 2 to 6 mm•day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The inclusion of aerosols (aeronEL-aeronCL) amplifies decrease in rainfall by 17% over the central India (10–25°N, 70–85°E). We estimate (aeronAMIP-aeroffAMIP experiments) that the aerosol loading in 2009 and 2015 has induced a rainfall deficit of 1–7 mm•day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (i.e. ~14%) over the central India (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4a,b</a>). The combined effect of El Niño and the increased aerosol loading leads to a rainfall deficit of approximately 4 to 12 mm•day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> over India (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). A schematic depicting aerosol distribution in the ATAL during normal and co-occurring El Niño simulation is shown in Fig.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This combined effect produces an aggravated subsidence over the Indian region compared to the individual effect of El Niño. The effect of aerosols weakens the zonal winds and enhances the anomalous subsidence over the monsoon region from the meridional overturning circulation over 15–30°N (Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5a,b</a>). The upper tropospheric temperature has a significant role in driving the monsoon circulation from the ocean to the sub-continent

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. The strong cooling during El Niño (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5c</a>) is further intensified by the presence of the aerosols (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5d</a>). This weakens the zonal inflow from the ocean, reducing the strength of a feeble monsoon Hadley circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, which in turn leads to an anomalous large-scale subsidence and suppresses the convection, therefore enhancing the severity of droughts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. The anomalous cooling over North India and TP is a consequence of the enhanced aerosol loading over the South Asian upper troposphere. While the general overestimation of UTLS aerosols in our model suggests that the impact on the severity of droughts is likely smaller than estimated here, this might be balanced by the additional contribution from nitrate aerosols

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We attribute the increase of drought severity to the following mechanism:
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par15">The El Niño induced atmospheric circulation lifts the boundary layer aerosol from East Asia to the UTLS and then to West Asia into the ATAL region.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par16">The added blanket of aerosol reduces the solar insolation, cooling the upper troposphere over the Tibetan Plateau and surface over North India.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par17">The resulting enhanced stability leads to a weakening of the monsoon Hadley circulation.</p>

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par18">The anomalous large-scale subsidence results in amplifying the severity of monsoon droughts.</p>
