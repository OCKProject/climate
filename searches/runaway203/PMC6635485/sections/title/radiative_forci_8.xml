  </span> with six shortwave and nine longwave bands, and a delta-Eddington two-stream scattering solver at all wavelengths. Aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients, together with asymmetry parameters, were calculated for each aerosol size mode and spectral band

  </span>. The indirect aerosol effect was not considered here. We also compared the relative radiative forcing in the lower-mid troposphere and in the UTLS by performing additional simulations where changes in aerosols, methane, ozone and water vapour were only applied at 1000–300 hPa and at 300–70 hPa, respectively.
