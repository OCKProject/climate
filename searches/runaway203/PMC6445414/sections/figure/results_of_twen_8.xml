  <div class="title">Results of twenty randomly selected Monte Carlo trials.</div>
  <p>Each line represents the relative biomass trajectory of that species over the course of a single trial. Note that the starting value for all species is one, and model results is relative to that value. Also Note that the y-axis scales for

   <span class="italic">rossii</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gunnari</span> are two to three orders of magnitude larger than the scales for the other species, indicating much higher sensitivity and uncertainty for these two species.
