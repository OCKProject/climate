 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To create a mass balanced model, Ecopath uses an estimate of consumption (Eqs

  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0214814.e002" href="#pone.0214814.e002">2</a>). This estimate is often input to the model as either a production to consumption (P/Q) ratio or a consumption to biomass (Q/B) ratio. The P/Q ratio can be calculated as growth efficiency, or the product of the assimilation efficiency (AE) and production efficiency [PE; 7]. Published AE values exist for many groups (

  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>] we calculated Q/B ratios by dividing group specific estimates of P/Q into group specific estimate of P/B.
