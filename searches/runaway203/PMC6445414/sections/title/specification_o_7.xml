 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The production to biomass ratio (P/B) describes the turnover rate, or rate at which a trophic group can replace itself. This rate is poorly described for many species at lower trophic levels. Due to lack of data, the P/B ratios for primary producers, micro-, meso-, and macro- zooplankton, salps, and benthic invertebrates were adopted from previously published models. Ballerini et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>] estimated phytoplankton productivity from satellite imagery; the estimated P/B for the “other euphausiid” functional group was from studies conducted in Japan [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref037">37</a>]; and the estimated P/B value for salps was from Pakhomov [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref038">38</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Krill were modeled as a multi-stanza group, with one stanza for animals younger than 24 months (small krill) and a second for animals older than 24 months (large krill). Instead of P/B, base mortality (Z) was input for each stanza [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref020">20</a>]. The multi-stanza approach assumes that body growth for the species follows a von Bertalanffy curve and that the species’ population, as a whole, has reached a stable age-size distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref020">20</a>]. These assumptions seem valid for the Antarctic krill population [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref039">39</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref040">40</a>]. A recent review of published mortality rates for krill indicates that temperature, age composition of the population, and sub region where the krill are sampled can significantly influence estimated mortality rates; estimates range from 0.38 to 1.22 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref041">41</a>]. Models currently used to inform the management of the krill fishery use a natural mortality value of 0.8 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref042">42</a>]. Krill catches, approximately 210,000 tonnes for the entire fishery during the period 1992–2002 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref010">10</a>] are low compared to consumption by predators [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref043">43</a>], so the natural mortality rate is a good approximation of Z for krill. We used the mortality value used to inform management of the krill fishery, 0.8, for both large and small krill. This value, and the von Bertalanffy curvature constant (K) of 0.440 are derived from the work of Rosenberg et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref040">40</a>] and of Candy and Kawaguchi [

  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref009">9</a>] provide a compilation of all estimates of P/B ratios for fishes. The P/B value for myctophids ranges between 0.86–1.14. The value of 1.1 was used in the current model. Similarly, Hill et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref009">9</a>] note that the P/Bs of fishes living on the continental shelf range from 0.19–0.60 and recommend a value of 0.46, which was adopted here. A natural mortality rate of 0.29 is recognized as the best estimate for

  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref018">18</a>] and was used in our model. Iverson [

  <span class="italic">Champsocephalus gunnari</span> ranged between 0.23–0.96, and models used to inform fisheries management for this species use the midrange value of 0.48 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref009">9</a>]. We also used the value of 0.48. A specific P/B value for
