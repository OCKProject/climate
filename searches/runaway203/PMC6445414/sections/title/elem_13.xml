 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three types of data were used in the time dynamic simulations for the WAP. The first were time series that describe trends in the biomasses of eight monitored species for the years 1996–2012 and which were used to asses model fit. None of the biomass time-series data were used to force corresponding biomasses the model. Reliable, yearly time-series datasets dating back to at least the 1990s are available for five species included in the model: Antarctic fur seals, Adélie penguins, chinstrap penguins, gentoo penguins, and Antarctic krill. Less regular time-series data are available for three fishes: 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">rossii</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gunnari</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gibberifrons</span> (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214814.s006" href="#pone.0214814.s006">S6 File</a> provides sources and notes describing the biomass time-series data). The time series-data used for fur seals were collected at the colony that is responsible for approximately 80% of the pup production in the region[
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref053">53</a>]. The time-series data for the three penguin species reflect region-wide trends [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref054">54</a>]. Krill recruitment patterns are similar in terms of timing and magnitude in both the northern and southern half of the study area [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref041">41</a>] and therefore using data collected in the northern half of the study area can be considered to reflect region wide trends. Datasets for air-breathing vertebrates represent counts of animals in discrete locations; krill data represent estimated densities from acoustic surveys (fisheries independent) and fisheries catch (fisheries dependent); and fish data are biomass estimates derived from trawl surveys. Fisheries independent measurements of krill density were used to asses fit of the model. All time-series data describing trends in biomass were included in the model as “relative biomass”, which allows the model to fit to trends for these species, without information on scale. To keep the start of the time dynamic simulations consistent with the model year, data prior to 1996 were not included in the Ecosim runs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Times series for catches taken by the krill fishery and krill-fishing effort [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref010">10</a>] were initially included in the model. It is possible to asses model fit for krill biomass using the catch data. However commercial fishing activity has recently concentrated in relatively confined areas defining preferred fishing grounds [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref011">11</a>]. These data may not be representative of the region and may show patterns more related to the economics of fishing than to krill biology. Therefore, the model was fitted to the fisheries independent data. Fishing effort data, as reported to CCAMLR [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref010">10</a>] were included in the model to capture the temporal dynamics of the fishery from 1996–2012.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third type of data used in Ecosim simulations were time series describing environmental conditions that may have influenced biomass trends, called forcing functions. Four forcing functions were used: sea-ice area, open water area, chlorophyll 
  <span class="italic">a</span> concentration, and observed predation mortality rate of fur seal pups. Forcing functions were applied as multipliers to impact specific predator-prey interactions, or for primary producers as a multiplier on production rate. For consumers, the multiplier can be applied to search rate, vulnerability, foraging arena area or a combination of vulnerability and arena area [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref020">20</a>]. Forcing functions were also applied to more directly drive the biomasses of krill and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gibberifrons</span> using response curves to tie the increases in biomass to changing environmental conditions. The processes for evaluating applications of forcing functions and response curves are discussed in the Model Calibration section below. Due to the hypothesized importance of the sea-ice regime in influencing krill abundance and ecosystem dynamics [

  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref016">16</a>], special attention was paid to sea-ice forcing.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) program serves time series of monthly average sea-ice and open water areas in km
  <span class="sup">2</span> for their study area (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/catalogs/pallter/datasets/34" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/catalogs/pallter/datasets/34</span>). The sea-ice area is sensed by microwave satellite. Areas are considered “iced” when they have more than 15% ice cover [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref055">55</a>] and a time series was created of the monthly average total iced area (in km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Initially, the satellite derived, unaltered time series of total sea-ice covered area (in km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for the Palmer LTER study area was incorporated in the model. However, that appeared to have little or no impact on model patterns of biomass (hereafter model results); model results did not fit the time-series data describing changes in biomass. A sea-ice index was made to identify “good ice years” and smooth some of this variability. Since winter sea ice is thought to affect Adélie penguin survivorship [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref056">56</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref057">57</a>] attempts were made to focus on winter ice conditions. However, the Palmer LTER sea-ice dataset does not exhibit sufficient variability in the maximum winter sea-ice area. For many years, the entire LTER study area was completely covered in ice, and thus this measure does not adequately distinguish between years. Instead, the annual summer sea-ice area minimum was used to construct the sea-ice index. The assumption that years with greater sea-ice in the summer also have greater annual ice coverage underlies our index. This may be a reasonable assumption as warmer summers are known to contribute to accelerating sea-ice loss through a positive feedback loop [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref058">58</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref059">59</a>], and therefore cooler icier summers would not cause ice to be lost as rapidly as warmer, less icy, summers. We used annual sea-ice minima, as documented in the Palmer LTER data, that were scaled by the average value to construct the index. Years where the minimum sea-ice area was greater than average had index values greater than one; those below average had index values less than one. The scaled dataset (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214814.g002" href="#pone.0214814.g002">Fig 2</a>) was used as the sea-ice forcing function in the model. The annual value was repeated for each monthly time step of that year, and, during the calibration process, the forcing function was applied as a multiplier to impact specific predator-prey interactions.
