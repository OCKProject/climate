All currently monitored species seem likely to feature in a research and monitoring plan associated with a new MPA and were modeled as single species. Other species, such as non-krill zooplankton, phytoplankton, and fishes for which relatively little data exist, were combined into multi-species functional groups.

For large krill, multiple density estimates are available during this time period and we averaged densities for the years 1996–2001 to determine the biomass to input to Ecopath.

Rather than introduce additional complexity and uncertainty by attempting to estimate the biomasses of the phytoplankton and ice-algae functional groups from remotely sensed imagery, we used the model itself to calculate biomass for primary producers.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To create a mass balanced model, Ecopath uses an estimate of consumption (Eqs 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0214814.e001" href="#pone.0214814.e001">1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0214814.e002" href="#pone.0214814.e002">2</a>). This estimate is often input to the model as either a production to consumption (P/Q) ratio or a consumption to biomass (Q/B) ratio. The P/Q ratio can be calculated as growth efficiency, or the product of the assimilation efficiency (AE) and production efficiency [PE; 7]. Published AE values exist for many groups (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214814.s004" href="#pone.0214814.s004">S4 File</a>). The PE values were derived from Townsend et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref047">47</a>]. Consistent with Ballerini et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>] we calculated Q/B ratios by dividing group specific estimates of P/Q into group specific estimate of P/B.

We note that for the multispecies functional groups where cannibalism is most likely to occur, there are not sufficient data to support further subdivision of the groups or creation of multi stanzas for the group to circumvent within group cannibalism. The diet matrix was informed by published diet-composition studies and publicly available reports of prey choices. Except for sperm whales, diet data were sourced from studies conducted in the Antarctic. Diet studies referenced include gut content analyses, visual observation of prey consumption, and stable isotope analysis. Sources for the diet matrix and notes describing how the diets were adapted from the values provided in the published literature are provided in

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Balancing the Ecopath model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collated the data described above to create a mass balanced food-web model for the WAP, specifically Statistical Subarea 48.1. When the model was initially implemented, with parameters taken directly out of the literature, EE values for several groups, including important prey species such as krill and on-shelf fish, were significantly greater than 1. Predation pressure was too high on those groups. Many of the diet studies referenced within the diet matrix have small, spatially constrained sample sizes relative to their respective populations (e.g.[
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref049">49</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref050">50</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref051">51</a>]). It was assumed that the diets presented in studies covering small or restricted areas accurately represent the diversity of important prey items for each species, but that the percentage of mass in the diet was uncertain. Thus, we balanced the model by adjusting the diet matrix. Starting with the diets of predators that ate the prey items with the highest EE, diets were adjusted incrementally until the model balanced. This was an iterative process during which we made small changes to diets, less than 5% at a time, and then checked the EE values for all prey items to ensure the latter parameters were less than one. Balance was achieved, and diet iterations complete, when the EEs for all groups were less than one.
