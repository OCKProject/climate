 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diet matrix describes trophic interactions among all species and functional groups in the model. Cannibalism was not allowed to occur for any group as it can cause instability [

We note that for the multispecies functional groups where cannibalism is most likely to occur, there are not sufficient data to support further subdivision of the groups or creation of multi stanzas for the group to circumvent within group cannibalism. The diet matrix was informed by published diet-composition studies and publicly available reports of prey choices. Except for sperm whales, diet data were sourced from studies conducted in the Antarctic. Diet studies referenced include gut content analyses, visual observation of prey consumption, and stable isotope analysis. Sources for the diet matrix and notes describing how the diets were adapted from the values provided in the published literature are provided in
