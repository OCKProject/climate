 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model was calibrated and successfully recreated observed trends in the biomasses of key monitored species. The calibration of the model represents a significant advancement over the previously published, uncalibrated EwE models for the region [see: 7, 23, 24]. The decrease in total SS by 65% (relative to a balanced but uncalibrated model) highlighted the potential importance of the sea-ice regime in structuring the marine ecosystem of Statistical Subarea 48.1. This finding agrees with long-term ecological studies in the area [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological implications of model choices for the 1996–2012 WAP model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model builds on previous Ecopath models of the region [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref022">22</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref025">25</a>], and uses many of the same data sources as the previous models to inform choices regarding Ecopath and Ecosim parameters. Yet, our model has some key features which could influence ecological interpretation of the results.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As noted by the earlier models, data describing the total biomass of primary production for the region were not readily available. Heymans et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref034">34</a>] highlighted that coastal ecosystems with strong seasonal patterns in primary production typically have EE values less than 0.5. By adopting this EE value, we modelled the WAP as if there was ample primary production. The phytoplankton biomass values estimated by the model were high, but Statistical Subarea 48.1 is a region that generally experiences high chl-
   <span class="italic">a</span> concentrations and high krill growth rates [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref068">68</a>], and high sedimentation rates in the summer [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref069">69</a>]. Collectively this indicates that there may be ample food for krill and that setting the EE value to 0.5 was reasonable.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model included a larger biomass of krill than most of the earlier models. The increased biomass of krill resulted from using the NOAA-AMLR acoustic time series of krill density (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swfsc.noaa.gov/AERD-Data/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://swfsc.noaa.gov/AERD-Data/</span>), to both set the biomass in Ecopath and serve as the reference time series used for calibration. The NOAA-AMLR study area may encompass a particularly krill rich region, as densities reported by NOAA-AMLR were higher than the average densities reported in a concurrent synoptic survey for entire the region [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref070">70</a>]. With the exception of Cornejo-Donoso and Antezana [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref022">22</a>], the previously published models adopted krill biomasses that were more consistent with the average values presented in the synoptic survey [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref070">70</a>]. Using a higher biomass in our model could imply that krill predators were less food limited than in the earlier studies. However, that comparison is challenging to make across models. The Ecotrophic Efficiency (EE) for krill in the present study was 0.97, indicating that roughly 97% of the available krill were consumed by predators and caught by the fishery. Cornejo-Donoso and Antezana [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref022">22</a>] and Erfran and Pitcher [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref025">25</a>] set the EE for krill in their models to 0.95 and allowed their models to estimate the biomass of krill needed to satisfy predators at that level of consumption. The results were very different; the Cornejo-Donoso and Antezana [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref022">22</a>] model estimated a biomass of approximately 105 t/km
   <span class="sup">2</span> and Erfran and Pitcher [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref025">25</a>]estimated approximately 27 t/km
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Suprenand and Ainsworth [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref023">23</a>] and Hoover et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref024">24</a>], used low biomasses of adult krill (approximately 9 t/km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) and also estimated low EEs, both of which were less than 0.8. Collectively, the existing Ecopath models for the region, seem to portray the possibility of food limitations for krill predators quite differently. Such conflicting information may not be helpful to marine resource managers. Our estimate that 97% of krill is either consumed by predators or caught by the fishery is consistent with work by Trivelpiece et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref054">54</a>] and Hinke et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref071">71</a>] which suggested that in areas where the fishery is active krill predators may be limited by krill availability. Our model used actual field data to describe krill biomass and was calibrated to time-series data for both krill and krill predators. Therefore, we suggest that our model may better suited than the earlier Ecopath models for examining trends in krill biomass and the potential of food limitation for krill predators.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model included a large biomass of salps; salp biomass was roughly twice the size of the biomass of large krill. This was a significant departure from the previously published models where salp biomass was well below the biomass of krill [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref022">22</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref025">25</a>]. The high biomass of salps in this model was informed by the work of Loeb and Santora [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref072">72</a>] who found that, in the NOAA-AMLR study area, salp abundance was highly variable but could be as much as six times greater than that of krill. Additionally, Atkinson et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref016">16</a>] reported that the Antarctic Peninsula region experienced at least a two-fold increase in salps and a similar decline in krill during the 1990s and early 2000s. Salps rarely appear as a prey item in diet studies this may possibly reflect low consumption of salps or the fact that once consumed, salp tissue because unrecognizable more quickly than the remains of prey items that contain hard body parts. We therefore estimate the EE of salps to be very low. As a result, in our model, much of the primary production was consumed by salps, rather than krill. Primary production was not transferred to higher trophic levels or available for krill to consume. Salp biomass is highly variable and responsive to environmental conditions [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref072">72</a>]. If warming and sea-ice loss continue in the region, salp biomass might be expected to increase[
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref016">16</a>] and consume primary production that krill could have consumed. In setting the EE for primary producers to 0.5 we modelled the system as if krill were not food limited. However, in the future, in areas where salp biomass has increased, it seems possible that krill may be food limited.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calibration process, which involved fitting the model to times series using forcing functions, provided an opportunity to explore environmental impacts on foraging interactions. Two previously published models developed Ecosim scenarios [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref023">23</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref024">24</a>], but those models were not calibrated, and the authors did not detail their application of forcing on predator-prey interactions. We note that one of those models, Hoover et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref024">24</a>] also attempted to calibrate their model using sea-ice forcing and evaluated use of the Palmer LTER data describing sea-ice extent [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref055">55</a>] to build the sea-ice forcing function. The final model developed by Hoover et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref024">24</a>] ultimately used different sea-ice data, only applied sea-ice forcing to the ice algae functional group, used sea-ice to drive the model for larval and juvenile krill rather than larger adult krill, and was ultimately unsuccessful at recreating trends in the abundance of penguins. Our model was the first to be successfully calibrated for the region and we are the first set of authors to list the forcing function applications that helped us fit the model to time-series data. As such, our model is a significant improvement over the Hoover et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref024">24</a>] model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of forcing functions yielded some unexpected results. While the impacts of removing a single forcing function application were small, each forcing application influenced the others and their effects were collectively quite large. When all forcing functions and drivers were used the total SS decreased by 65%. Adélie penguins were notably absent from the list of predators where forcing was successfully applied. Hinke et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref056">56</a>] found that overwinter foraging success and survival of juvenile penguins was impacted by sea-ice conditions, and that when conditions were icier, over winter foraging success and survival were both higher. Yet, applying sea-ice forcing to Adélie penguin foraging interactions did not improve the model fit. However, model fit was improved by driving large krill, the main prey of Adélie penguins [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref073">73</a>] with our sea-ice index. This implied that krill biomass, rather than specific foraging conditions, affected Adélie penguin biomass, a finding consistent with the work of Trivelpiece et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref054">54</a>]. We did not expect myctophid vulnerability to predation by chinstrap penguins to increase with the sea-ice index. The foraging arena describes the area where predator and prey are likely to overlap and where prey will be vulnerable to predation [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref020">20</a>]. It may be counter intuitive that the foraging arena shared by chinstrap penguins and myctophids would increase in icier conditions. However, this could imply that in icy conditions chinstrap penguins were pushed offshore and into areas where they were more likely to overlap with myctophids. The effect of this forcing was quite small (0.09 reduction of total SS), and it may simply represent fitting to noise in the data. A more influential forcing was applied to the interaction between chinstrap penguins and large krill, where krill vulnerability to predation and foraging arena area increased with the sea-ice index. This forcing reduced the total SS by 1.33, and had the second largest positive impact on total SS. It was also consistent with the findings from Hinke et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref057">57</a>] that chinstrap penguins experience greater foraging success and survivorship in icier conditions and from Trivelpiece et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref054">54</a>] that krill availability influences predator success. The physical forcing function that had the largest positive effect on model fit was particularly obvious. Ice algae were more vulnerable to consumption by large krill and shared a larger foraging arena with krill when chlorophyll 
   <span class="italic">a</span> concentration was high (1.48 reduction in total SS).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two forcing function applications that increased the total SS and worsened model fit were retained in the model. Both functions related to 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gunnari</span>, and impacted interactions with its other euphausiid prey (2.91 increase in SS) and with its on-shelf fish predators (4.06 increase in SS). Without applying forcing to these interactions, the model was not able to recreate the increase in biomass of 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gunnari</span> as documented in the time-series data [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref063">63</a>]. Systematic surveys have yet to be undertaken since those submitted by Kock and Jones [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref063">63</a>], but there is no indication that the most recent estimates are erroneously high. Therefore, it seemed prudent to force the model to recreate an increase in the biomass of this fish, despite worsening fits to other time series. The MC simulations illustrated that the model was particularly sensitive to inputs for 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gunnari</span>. Given the gaps in the timeseries data, the relatively high uncertainty associated with the Ecopath input parameters, and the demonstrated model sensitivity to the input parameters, our results 
   <span class="italic">for C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gunnari</span> should be viewed with some skepticism.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model was designed to investigate the effects of sea ice on biomass. Measures of the sea-ice regime were the primary environmental drivers considered in this study, and the dynamics of roughly 25% of the predator groups in the model were tied to changes in the sea-ice regime through application of various forcing functions. Unsurprisingly, biomass projected by the model thus reflects changes in the sea-ice index. Over the course of the calibration period, the sea-ice index generally declined, except for in 2005 and 2006. The time-series data describing abundance show declines over the same period for five out of the eight species. Two of these species, Antarctic fur seals and Antarctic krill increased in biomass during 2007 and these increases were moderately reflected in the model results. While using the sea-ice index to drive the model for krill significantly improved the total SS and allowed the model to adequately fit the observed time series of krill biomass, the model was not able to recreate all the peaks in the time series. Some factor that is not currently captured by the model is likely influencing krill population dynamics. The three species that increased both in the model results and in the real world, had positive responses to more open water conditions.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current climate models indicate that sea-ice loss will continue [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref074">74</a>]. In the future, successful management of marine living resources around the WAP could depend on understanding and predicting how species might respond to changes in the sea-ice regime. The simulations presented here investigated the role of temporal sea-ice dynamics as one possible mechanism influencing biomass. This was accomplished by using sea ice to force predation interactions and drive the model for large krill and the fish 
   <span class="italic">G</span>. 
   <span class="italic">gibberifrons</span>. Including the sea-ice regime allowed the model to recreate documented biomass trends and improved the fit by decreasing the total SS approximately 65%. While the model now adequately recreates documented changes in biomasses of the eight monitored species, it does not capture all the variability in available time-series data. Some factor not currently included in the model likely has a notable impact on the population dynamics of krill and krill predators. The results of our simulations are consistent with previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref002">2</a>] and indicate that the role of sea-ice in structuring the WAP marine ecosystem may be both central and complex.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea-ice index used in our model was a normalized, relative measure of annual minimum sea-ice area. Previous studies used the winter maximum sea-ice to model recruitment and survival of krill dependent predators [

   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref057">57</a>]. Summer is the breeding season for monitored krill predators such as penguins [

These species are central place foragers and are required to return to their colonies to feed their young during the breeding season. Summer environmental conditions, including the interaction of sea-ice, temperature, and precipitation patterns, have been shown to impact breeding success and penguin population dynamics [

While summer sea-ice minima, rather than winter maxima, were used in the present study, our work did not contradict earlier findings. Sea-ice loss is impacted by a positive feedback loop of ice-free waters absorbing more solar radiation and warming faster [

   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref056">56</a>] focused on the northern part of WAP, where there seemed to be more winter sea-ice variability than what was recorded in the Palmer LTER data set. Here we came to the same conclusion as Hinke et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref056">56</a>] that seasonal sea-ice dynamics, whether lagged winter maxima in the north or normalized summer minima in the south, influence krill and penguin abundance.

The curve might be useful in other modeling studies that explore how sea-ice dynamics affect the regional ecosystem. We assert that our model can be used to explore how krill might respond to future changes in the sea-ice regime as the area continues to warm. Similarly, we identified a sea-ice response curve for

   <span class="italic">gibberifrons</span> that allowed the model to recreate observed trends in the abundance of this fish.

   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref081">81</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref082">82</a>]. The CCAMLR may find the model presented here useful when it considers future management strategies for the krill fishery in Statistical Subarea 48.1. The model was created to purposefully explore the influence of changes in the sea-ice regime. It may be possible to develop and explore future sea ice scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of future changes in the sea-ice regime on biomass. Some species, such as Antarctic krill might be expected to decline with ice loss [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref016">16</a>]. Our model could help explore how a decrease in krill biomass might impact the biomass of krill predators and other species less directly connected to krill through the food web. Such a study would complement the work done by Klein et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref083">83</a>]. Collectively, work using two models to explore the potential impacts of climate change may be particularly useful to CCAMLR as it seeks to meet its conservation objectives.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, the CCAMLR agreed that creating a representative system of marine protected areas could help to both conserve Antarctic marine biodiversity and aid in the management of sustainable fisheries [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref084">84</a>]. The CCAMLR has identified the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea region, which includes Statistical Subarea 48.1, as a priority area for developing an MPA [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref084">84</a>]. The CCAMLR has also adopted a framework for the establishment of future MPAs [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref085">85</a>]. This framework stipulates that MPAs should be created using the best available science and aim to protect key ecosystem processes, among other protection objectives. Trophic interactions affect biomass and are important ecosystem processes to consider for protection. In the face of sustained warming and continued sea-ice loss [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref001">1</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref002">2</a>], it could be useful to consider dynamic trophic interactions when planning an MPA.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model is intended to aid in the MPA planning process for the region. The groups in our model include single-species groups for most indicator species in Statistical Subarea 48.1 [
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref030">30</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0214814.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref031">31</a>]. These species will likely be important as the Members of CCAMLR set conservation goals during the MPA planning process and develop monitoring and management plans. Our model is calibrated to available time-series data. As such, the food-web model and time-dynamic simulations presented here lay the foundation for developing a spatial model that could explore MPA placement while considering the dynamic sea-ice regime and trophic interactions.
