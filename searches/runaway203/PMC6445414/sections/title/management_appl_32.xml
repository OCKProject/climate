 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the international organization responsible for managing Antarctic marine living resources, has long recognized that understanding ecosystem structure and processes is essential to managing a sustainable krill fishery [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref081">81</a>]. The CCAMLR makes its fisheries management decisions within a conservation framework that considers both harvested and associated species [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref081">81</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref082">82</a>]. The CCAMLR may find the model presented here useful when it considers future management strategies for the krill fishery in Statistical Subarea 48.1. The model was created to purposefully explore the influence of changes in the sea-ice regime. It may be possible to develop and explore future sea ice scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of future changes in the sea-ice regime on biomass. Some species, such as Antarctic krill might be expected to decline with ice loss [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref016">16</a>]. Our model could help explore how a decrease in krill biomass might impact the biomass of krill predators and other species less directly connected to krill through the food web. Such a study would complement the work done by Klein et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref083">83</a>]. Collectively, work using two models to explore the potential impacts of climate change may be particularly useful to CCAMLR as it seeks to meet its conservation objectives.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, the CCAMLR agreed that creating a representative system of marine protected areas could help to both conserve Antarctic marine biodiversity and aid in the management of sustainable fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref084">84</a>]. The CCAMLR has identified the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea region, which includes Statistical Subarea 48.1, as a priority area for developing an MPA [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref084">84</a>]. The CCAMLR has also adopted a framework for the establishment of future MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref085">85</a>]. This framework stipulates that MPAs should be created using the best available science and aim to protect key ecosystem processes, among other protection objectives. Trophic interactions affect biomass and are important ecosystem processes to consider for protection. In the face of sustained warming and continued sea-ice loss [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref002">2</a>], it could be useful to consider dynamic trophic interactions when planning an MPA.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model is intended to aid in the MPA planning process for the region. The groups in our model include single-species groups for most indicator species in Statistical Subarea 48.1 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref030">30</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref031">31</a>]. These species will likely be important as the Members of CCAMLR set conservation goals during the MPA planning process and develop monitoring and management plans. Our model is calibrated to available time-series data. As such, the food-web model and time-dynamic simulations presented here lay the foundation for developing a spatial model that could explore MPA placement while considering the dynamic sea-ice regime and trophic interactions.
