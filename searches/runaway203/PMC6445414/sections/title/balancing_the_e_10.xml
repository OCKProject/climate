 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collated the data described above to create a mass balanced food-web model for the WAP, specifically Statistical Subarea 48.1. When the model was initially implemented, with parameters taken directly out of the literature, EE values for several groups, including important prey species such as krill and on-shelf fish, were significantly greater than 1. Predation pressure was too high on those groups. Many of the diet studies referenced within the diet matrix have small, spatially constrained sample sizes relative to their respective populations (e.g.[
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref049">49</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref050">50</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref051">51</a>]). It was assumed that the diets presented in studies covering small or restricted areas accurately represent the diversity of important prey items for each species, but that the percentage of mass in the diet was uncertain. Thus, we balanced the model by adjusting the diet matrix. Starting with the diets of predators that ate the prey items with the highest EE, diets were adjusted incrementally until the model balanced. This was an iterative process during which we made small changes to diets, less than 5% at a time, and then checked the EE values for all prey items to ensure the latter parameters were less than one. Balance was achieved, and diet iterations complete, when the EEs for all groups were less than one.
