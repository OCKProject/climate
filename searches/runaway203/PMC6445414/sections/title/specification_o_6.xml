 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The base year of the model was 1996. Initial biomass estimates for all consumer groups reflected data collected during the period 1992–2002, and for many groups only a single estimate was available during this time frame (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214814.s002" href="#pone.0214814.s002">S2 File</a>). For large krill, multiple density estimates are available during this time period and we averaged densities for the years 1996–2001 to determine the biomass to input to Ecopath. Data on the biomass of primary producers in the region are scarce and region-wide estimates are not available. While satellite imagery describing chlorophyll concentrations is available nine months of the year [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref032">32</a>], measurements of chlorophyll concentrations do not capture ice algae and may not correlate well with 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> measurements of phytoplankton biomass [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref033">33</a>]. Rather than introduce additional complexity and uncertainty by attempting to estimate the biomasses of the phytoplankton and ice-algae functional groups from remotely sensed imagery, we used the model itself to calculate biomass for primary producers. This was accomplished by setting the ecotrophic efficiency (EE), the proportion of production of any given model group utilized in the system (see equation 6 of [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref020">20</a>]), and allowing the model to calculate the biomass required to balance this proportion of utilization. This was the same approach used by Ballerini et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref007">7</a>]. Following the advice of Heymans et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref034">34</a>], the EE for primary producers in this largely pelagic ecosystem was set to 0.5 [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref033">33</a>]. For all other groups, we input biomasses and used the model to calculate the EEs. Fisheries catch data are regularly reported to the CCAMLR [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref010">10</a>], and the average krill catch for the years 1995–2001, which represented catches near the base year of the model, was included as “landings” in Ecopath. We did not include discards as discards are not clearly identified in the publicly available CCAMLR data [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The abundances of two species of whales are known to be increasing in the study area [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref035">35</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref036">36</a>]. However, while estimates of the rate of increase have been presented, no reliable times series of abundance are available. Humpback whales (
  <span class="italic">Megaptera novaeangliae</span>) have experienced an estimated average population growth for the region of 4.5% per year with a 95% confidence interval of -2.9% to 12.3% [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref035">35</a>]. Initially, we used a biomass accumulation term of 4.5%, but the model failed to balance if the biomass accumulation term for humpback whales was greater than 3.9%, so we used this later value. While annual population-growth rates have not been published for fin whales (
  <span class="italic">Balaenoptera physalus</span>) in the study region, reported sightings data [
  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref036">36</a>] reveal that fin whale sightings have increased at a similar, but slightly lesser rate. A biomass accumulation term of 2.9% per year was used for Fin whales.
