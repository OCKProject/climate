  </span> we use the Global Warming Index with observations from Cowtan &amp; Way to estimate an anthropogenic contribution to temperature change of 1.076 °C from 1850 to 1879 average in May 2017. The Global Warming Index removes an estimate of the natural component of forcing from the temperature record, and as such our baseline is slightly higher than observational datasets including the unmodified Cowtan &amp; Way estimate. At current rates, the anthropogenic warming should have reached 1.1 °C sometime in mid-to-late 2018, and we use this figure as our 2018 level. We find that future temperature projections in the Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios are insensitive to which observational data set is used for constraint
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>, but our results do depend on our starting point and how close we currently are to 1.5 °C, which in turn depends on how global mean surface temperature is defined

 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cowtan &amp; Way use observations from HadCRUT4 (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>), comprising of sea surface temperatures over the ocean and near-surface air temperatures over land, in-filled for missing data (blended, in the notation of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>). The missing data is from regions of the world where no observations exist. The polar regions, where observations are sparse, are warming faster than the rest of the planet. Therefore, the HadCRUT4 observations (blended-masked, in the notation of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>) tend to produce lower estimates of the observed warming than blended (and unmasked) datasets such as Cowtan &amp; Way. Providing that global temperature observational coverage continues to increase, and that the in-filling method of Cowtan &amp; Way is sufficiently accurate, the blended-masked observations will converge towards the blended observations in the future.

 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third possibility is using near-surface air temperatures globally, over ocean regions as well as the land (tas-only in the notation of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>). This reflects the estimates of global mean surface temperature usually reported from climate models, and is typically higher than blended and blended-masked observations because the air above the sea surface warms faster than the ocean surface itself. A drawback of this method is that there are limited historical observations of near-surface air temperature over the ocean, and any observational data set would have to be infilled and likely correlated with data from other sources such as climate models.
