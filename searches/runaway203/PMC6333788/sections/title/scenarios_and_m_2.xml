 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define infrastructural commitments based on assumptions around today’s carbon-emitting capital stock. In our central scenario, CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are phased out from the end of 2018 at a close to linear rate, becoming near zero after 40 years, with cumulative post 2018 CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions of 195 GtC. In these scenarios, fossil fuel power plants, cars, aircraft, ships, and industrial infrastructure are replaced with zero carbon alternatives at the end of their life, and are phased out based on historical retirement data

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, which are a set of narratives developed for integrated assessment models (IAMs) defining regional population growth, economic development and energy demand. From these narratives, IAMs produce a time series of global emissions over the 2010 to 2100 period. We investigate emissions under the SSP1 (green-growth
  <span class="sup">

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For infrastructure commitments, we use the labels FAST, MID and SLOW to denote retirement rates for fossil fuel infrastructure. For the energy sector, these correspond to phase-outs over 30, 40 or 50 years based on the analysis of Davis and Socolow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Different rates of fossil fuel phase-outs based on infrastructural lifetimes and age profiles for the transport and industrial sectors are used and also follow FAST, MID and SLOW trajectories (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), whereas a slower phase-out for agricultural emissions was assumed on the assumption that less mitigation potential exists for these predominantly non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. In addition to FAST, MID, SLOW scenarios, a scenario with emissions set to zero instantaneously in either 2018 or 2030 (ZERO) is analysed for all SSPs considered. Furthermore, a CONST (constant forcing commitment) is analysed for SSP2-2018 and SSP2 with conditional NDCs starting in 2030 (SSP2c-2030).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This provides a total of 38 scenarios (3 SSPs × 3 NDC/start dates × 4 commitments, plus 2 CONST experiments for SSP2). The sector-dependent emissions of non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases and SLCFs are also considered in our pathways (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our phase-out scenarios are not bottom-up sectoral emissions projections or derived from detailed modelling. Instead, they assess the potential speed of emissions phase-out of each sector based on earlier literature and asset lifetimes. The scenarios assume mean rates of decarbonisation of 0.30, 0.23 and 0.18 GtC yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for the FAST, MID and SLOW pathways over the first 30, 40 or 50 years, respectively (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). In comparison, the mean rate of emissions increase over 2006–2016 was 0.15 GtC  yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (ref.

 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All scenarios are run using version 1.3.6 of the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) simple climate model
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. FaIR includes a simple representation of biogeochemical feedbacks that reduce the efficiency of land and ocean carbon sinks with cumulative carbon uptake and increasing temperatures. The model produces CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and effective radiative forcing (ERF) from its carbon cycle. ERF from non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> species are based on relationships between emitted greenhouse gases and SLCFs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. The generated ERF time series is compared with the ERF time series in Annex II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), Working Group I
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span> and a time-varying scale factor for forcing strength is applied throughout the historical period. This ensures that the best estimate anthropogenic non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing matches the AR5 time series. This scaling factor decays linearly between 2000 and 2011, allowing a smooth transition from the AR5 forcing regime to the FaIR calculated values used for future projections. No historical scaling factor is applied to non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases, as recent work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> has shown that methane forcing is underestimated by ~25% in AR5 and we use the FaIR-generated ERFs throughout the historical and future periods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To produce the pathways used in our analysis, emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosol and ozone precursors from the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) historical scenario

  </span> are used from 1765 to 2000, followed by emissions from the SSP1, SSP2 or SSP3 scenarios from 2005 to either 2018 or 2030. A linear transition between the historical and SSP emissions for each species between 2000 and 2005 is implemented. Solar and volcanic forcing are not included, as we model the anthropogenic part of climate change. Temperature anomalies since pre-industrial are calculated using a two time-constant representation
  <span class="sup">

  </span> with a fast component representing the land, atmosphere and ocean mixed layer, and a slow component representing the deep ocean. The magnitude of temperature change due to the fast and slow thermal responses also depends on the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR), which are input parameters to the model. Atmospheric greenhouse gas compositions and effective radiative forcing for the SSP2 zero emissions commitments and phase-out scenarios are shown in Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use a 1000-member Monte Carlo sample of model input parameters for each scenario (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). These include the ECS, TCR, fast and slow ocean thermal response time constants, parameters governing the carbon cycle, and ERF strengths for 11 categories of anthropogenic forcing agents. The scaling of ERF of each forcing component (CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, minor greenhouse gases, tropospheric O
  <sub>3</sub>, stratospheric O
  <sub>3</sub>, aviation contrails, stratospheric water vapour, aerosols, black carbon on snow and land use) is varied based on their IPCC AR5 ERF uncertainty ranges
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. To span carbon cycle uncertainty, ranges are defined that produce a plausible best estimate of concentrations of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the present day of 407 ppm (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>), with a 5–95% range of 394 to 419 ppm. Although observations of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations are more constrained than this range
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, allowing present-day CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations to assume a distribution of values lets us explore the uncertainty from the future carbon cycle response. This uncertainty leads to a range of ERF of ~10% of the best estimate, which is still only half of the ERF uncertainty for CO
  <sub>2</sub> quoted in AR5 (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As working definition we employ a 1.1 °C human-induced warming estimate (the Global Warming Index (GWI))

  <span class="sup">

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). This results in 310 retained ensemble members for the SSP2 family of commitment scenarios (312 for SSP1 and 305 for SSP3, where differences relate to slight differences in the scenario evolutions between 2010 and 2018). Analysis of results is concentrated on the warming from 2018 until 2100.
