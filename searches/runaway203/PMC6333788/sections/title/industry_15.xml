 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of the existing lifetime of industrial infrastructure are not abundant, and we are therefore limited to using one estimate from the expected lifetimes of cement kilns of between 30 and 50 years

  </span>. The limitations of this are acknowledged, as industrial emissions cover a wide range of sub-sectors (manufacturing, metal processing, paper, chemicals, to name a few), with different profiles of emissions species. Reducing emissions to net zero in processes requiring heat input would be challenging without carbon capture and storage, on which our scenarios seek to avoid any explicit dependence.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We take an approach similar to transport lifetimes for industrial infrastructure based on eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>), with mean retirement ages of 30, 40 or 50 years for FAST, SLOW and MID and standard deviation of 6 years in all cases.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the mean of the logistic function represents the year in which half of industrial infrastructure is retired, industrial emissions reach net zero at a slower rate than energy emissions, which are phased out entirely after 30–50 years and transport emissions which follow logistic curves with shorter mean lifetimes (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This is a more conservative assumption, which reflects the increased difficulty of estimating the technical feasibility of phase-outs from this sector.
