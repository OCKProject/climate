 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume that the majority of road transport emissions are due to passenger cars. Globally, the number of cars manufactured has grown at an exponential rate of 3% per year, based on data from 2000 to 2017 (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>). We assume a historical scrappage rate based on passenger car data from the US which continues into the future. This is a modified logistic curve:

  </div>where 
  <span class="italic">t</span> is age in years and 
  <span class="italic">F</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) defines the probability that a car of age 
  <span class="italic">t</span> is scrapped that year. We make the simplified assumption that every car on the road contributes equally to CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, and that in the present day the number of alternative fuel vehicles is a negligible proportion of the world fleet. By applying the assumptions for year-on-year growth of number of vehicles produced with the rate of historical scrappage, we obtain an estimate of the age profile for the current fleet. We freeze this in the first year of our phase-out scenarios and impose that no new fossil fuel powered cars are manufactured. The current fleet is then retired at the rate of eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) given their 2018 (or 2030) age profiles, resulting in a yearly decline in the number of petrol and diesel cars on the road and associated CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions.
