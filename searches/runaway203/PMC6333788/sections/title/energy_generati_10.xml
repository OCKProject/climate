  </span> based on the historical precedent of power plant retirements over 30, 40 and 50 years. The MID profile represents their central 40-year estimate and is the one which we give most weight to in this study. Retirement profile curves from these scenarios were scaled in order to achieve the 30, 40 or 50 year phase-out from the 2018 or 2030 baseline emissions, which differ slightly to the absolute values in Davis and Socolow who conduct their analysis from 2012. Our scaled-up emissions project an energy sector commitment of 94â€‰GtC in 2018 based on a 40-year power plant retirement age.

  </span>. recently conducted a study of committed emissions in the energy generation sector using more up-to-date knowledge, concluding there was 82 GtC of committed emissions in power plants currently in operation and a further 74 GtC of emissions either planned or under construction. We only consider emissions from currently operating plants in this study. Our figure of 94 GtC is therefore a slight overestimate of Pfeiffer et al.
