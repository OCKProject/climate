By 2100, in contrast, 82% of ensemble members are cooler than at present, owing to a rapid decline in short-lived forcers. Excluding the possibility of strongly amplifying carbon cycle feedbacks such as permafrost melt or forest dieback, which are not included in our model, any peak temperature increase in such a scenario would be limited to 0.25 °C above present at the 75th percentile.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For zero emissions commitments, the strength of present-day aerosol cooling is the dominant contributing factor in determining the magnitude of peak warming

   </span>, describing between 40 and 60% of the variance in peak temperature projections. This is apparent in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and would suggest that uncertainties in future peak warming commitments can be better constrained if the present-day aerosol forcing is known with greater accuracy

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
   </span>. This finding is in contrast to high emission scenarios where the contribution of aerosol to the overall uncertainty in the temperature response becomes increasingly less important
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>. The prior distribution for year-2011 aerosol forcing is taken from the AR5 expert judgement assessed uncertainty range from a combination of CMIP5-era climate models and satellite observations. Climate models tend to produce estimates of aerosol ERF that are more negative than satellite observations, but methodological biases in both procedures prevent a conclusive assessment of which product is more likely to be more representative of the true aerosol ERF
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>. If present-day (2018) aerosol forcing is towards the less-negative end of the uncertainty range, the zero emissions commitment in SSP2-2018-ZERO is small; a lower bound of −1 W  m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> produces a peak warming that remains under 1.5 °C across all ensemble members (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). For some small negative values of present-day aerosol ERF, temperatures start to fall immediately after the zero emissions commitment suggesting that the decline in other SLCFs, mostly tropospheric ozone and methane, leads to a cooling that more than offsets a warming from aerosol removal under this scenario. For the SSP2-2018-MID infrastructure commitment there is a larger spread in peak temperature owing to the increased importance of other factors aside from the present-day aerosol forcing. These include climate sensitivity and the thermal response of the ocean, both of which have an extra few decades to act on the temperature evolution compared with SSP2-2018-ZERO. However, peak temperature remains below 1.5 °C in the SSP2-2018-MID ensemble when present-day aerosol ERF is less negative than − 0.6 W m

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For end-of-century warming, the ECS and TCR also play an important role alongside the total present-day aerosol ERF, with contributions to total variance of between 30 and 40% for 2100 temperature change. Again, this is owing to the long-term action of climate sensitivity on temperature for a 2100 time horizon compared to a peak warming. ECS or TCR and aerosol ERF are anti-correlated in our constrained ensemble (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>), but both have proven difficult to constrain to a narrow range
