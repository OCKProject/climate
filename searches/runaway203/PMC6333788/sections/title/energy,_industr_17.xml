  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> are applied to the total emissions of each species in the SSP scenario. In phase-out scenarios, emissions are scaled by the ratio of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from the energy or industrial sectors, respectively, to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from the first year of the phase-out. This treatment therefore assumes that non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are co-emitted with CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the same ratios as in 2018 or 2030.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar treatment is provided for road transport and non-road transport, in which phase-out of road and (aviation plus shipping) non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are treated individually and scaled to their corresponding CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions phase-out.
