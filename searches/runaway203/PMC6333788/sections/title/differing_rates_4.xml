 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate FAST, MID and SLOW phase-outs along with the ZERO commitment for SSP1 and SSP3 in addition. If the lifetime of fossil power plants is reduced by 10 years (FAST), resulting in post-2018 cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions of 149 GtC, peak warming remains below 1.5 °C for all SSPs in &gt; 67% of ensemble members (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Even if infrastructure lifetimes are extended by 10 years (SLOW; cumulative emissions 248 GtC), less than half of ensemble members exceed 1.5 °C. In addition, in the FAST phase-out scenarios, 2100 warming is below 1.5 °C in 83% or more of ensemble members in all SSPs and ~ 67% of ensemble members in the SLOW phase-out (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Delaying any infrastructural phase-out to 2030 results in more than half of ensemble members reaching a peak temperature exceeding 1.5 °C, even under a FAST phase-out (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, under all of these scenarios, &gt; 67% of the ensembles do not exceed 2 °C. As with the scenarios where phase-outs start in 2018, temperatures peak before the end of the century, and 2100 warming is &lt; 2 °C in 83% or more of ensemble members except for SSP3 under a SLOW phase-out (Supplementary Figure
