 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total marsh area in 2013 was about 80% of the total marsh area in 1988, and 16% of the marshes in 1988 turned into water by 2013 (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0003">3</a>). In 1988, the freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes composed 28%, 10%, 33%, and 29% of  the marshes in the study area, respectively, and 35%, 13%, 26%, 26% in 2013. The areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were quite stable, and their increased percentage was mostly a result of the decrease of the total marsh area. The marsh loss mainly occurred in the brackish and saline marshes, contributing to most of the 16% change of marsh‐to‐water from 1988 to 2013. The decrease of the brackish and saline marshes' areas were significant over time (

  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0002">2</a>d). The area of the brackish marshes decreased for 52.9% (from 2,326 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 1988 to 1,541 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2013), and the area of the saline marshes decreased for 17.9% (from 2,080 to 1,631 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). The area of the brackish marshes was negatively correlated with sea‐level, CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration, and temperature, and positively with precipitation (

  <a rid="ece35215-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" href="#ece35215-tbl-0005">A4</a>); the area of the saline marshes was negatively correlated with sea‐level rise rates and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The area changes of the different marsh systems from 1988 to 2013 varied spatially (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0001">1</a>). There was an expansion of brackish marshes into intermediate marshes and saline marshes in the Terrebonne Basin and a replacement of intermediate marshes with saline marshes in the Barataria Basin. Brackish marshes expanded into intermediate and freshwater marshes in the Breton Sound Basin.
