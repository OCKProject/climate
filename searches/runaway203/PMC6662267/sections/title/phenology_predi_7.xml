 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear models describing the correlations between the marsh phenology and the climatic variables are built on the historical data and used to predict the marsh phenology in the future (until 2050). The future sea‐level and air temperature in the study area are estimated using linear models based on the sea‐level data from the NOAA Grand Isle Station, and the air temperature data from the NWS New Orleans Airport Station, both dating back to the 1940s (Figure 
  <a rid="ece35215-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0005">A1</a>a, b). The slope of the sea‐level increase is 9 mm/year (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), which is in consistence with the literature (González &amp; Törnqvist, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0017">2011</a>; Jankowski, Törnqvist, &amp; Fernandes, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0022">2017</a>). The temperature increases at a speed of 0.016°C/year (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), falling within the lower ranges of projections from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4, 
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0009">2007</a>). The ranges of possible future atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations are obtained from the IPCC AR4 (
  <a rid="ece35215-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0021">Data Distribution Centre</a>). The future atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations are from two carbon cycle models (i.e., the Bern model, or BERN, and the Integrated Science Assessment Model, or ISAM) and under different emission scenarios (i.e., A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2, A1p, A2p, B1p, B2p, IS92a, and IS92a/SAR; Figure
