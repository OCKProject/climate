  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area is in four major basins in Louisiana, USA, at the northern Gulf of Mexico: the Barataria, Breton Sound, Pontchartrain, and Terrebonne basins (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35215-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35215-fig-0001">1</a>). The marshes are classified into freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline systems based on vegetation association and salinity (Gosselink, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0018">1984</a>). Freshwater marshes occupy habitats with a salinity &lt;0.5 ppt and are dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Panicum hemitomon</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Sagittaria falcata</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Eleocharis</span> sp. Intermediate marshes occupy habitats with salinity from 0.5 to 5 ppt and are dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Spartina patens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span>. Brackish marshes are characterized by salinities ranging from 5 to 18 ppt, and the dominant species are 
   <span class="italic">Spartina patens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Distichlis spicata</span>. Saline marshes occur where salinity is &gt;18 ppt, and the dominant species are 
   <span class="italic">Spartina alterniflora</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Distichlis spicata</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Juncus roemerianus</span>. The percentage of C4 plants increases with higher salinities, whereas the species richness and diversity decrease.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the longest continuous satellite record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat CDRs from 1984 to 2014, to create the phenological records of the marshes (Table 
   <a rid="ece35215-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35215-tbl-0002">A1</a>). The data are collected by three Landsat series satellites: (a) the Landsat 5 equipped with the Thematic Mapper (TM) that launched in 1984 and decommissioned in 2011; (b) the Landsat 7 equipped with the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that launched in 1999; and (c) the Landsat 8 equipped with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) that launched in 2013. All three sensors have a 30‐m spatial resolution and a 16‐day temporal revisit cycle. The study area locates within the Landsat scenes of Path 22 Row 40 and Path 22 Row 39. There are 359 relatively cloudless images (mosaics of the two Landsat scenes) used for the phenology modeling.

   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0031">2018</a>), and the NDVI‐based phenological records of the marshes are modeled using an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model (Mo, Momen, &amp; Kearney, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0032">2015</a>). This method is developed by Mo et al. (
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0032">2015</a>) to provide a rigorous statistical analysis for phenological curves of different vegetation that are represented by nonlinear functions with repeated‐measure variables. Phenological measurements (i.e., the NDVI) made on the same observational units (i.e., marsh systems) over time are treated as repeated measurements. The phenological records of the different marsh systems are fitted into three nonlinear models, the Gaussian, the stepwise Gaussian, and the stepwise logistic functions. The goodness‐of‐fit of the models is assessed via the Efron's pseudo 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Akaike Information Criterion Correction (AICC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The pseudo 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>, a statistic similar to 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> in the linear regression, indicates the percent variance explained by the nonlinear models (Hardin, Hilbe, &amp; Hilbe, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0019">2007</a>). The pseudo 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> ranges from −∞ to 1. A pseudo 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> closer to 1 indicates more variability in the data is explained. The AIC, AICC, and BIC indices evaluate models based on the principle of parsimony, that is, a model explains more variation in the data with fewer variables is considered a better fit (Boyce, Vernier, Nielsen, &amp; Schmiegelow, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0003">2002</a>; Richards, 
   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0045">2005</a>). Key phenological parameters, that is, peak NDVI, peak NDVI day, and growing season length (bracketing days that had NDVI &gt;90% of peak NDVI) for each marsh system in each year are estimated from the best‐fit model. The phenology modeling only considered existing marshes, that is, it is corrected for the marsh area changes over the 30 years.

   <a rid="ece35215-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35215-bib-0062">2012</a>). There are 2, 6, 5, 4, and 1 mosaic images used for 1988, 1997, 2001, 2007, and 2013, respectively, for a total of 18 images (Table 
   <a rid="ece35215-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35215-tbl-0003">A2</a>). The overall accuracy of using the CFMask for estimating the marshland area is 0.89 ± 0.04 (verified using the USGS Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle, DOQ; Table
