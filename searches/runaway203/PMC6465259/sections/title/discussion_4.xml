 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of climate models to reliably simulate event probabilities remain overlooked in current practice of event attribution studies. Simulated probabilities can be confronted with observations as shown in this study and their reliability is a concern in simulations designed for event attribution. By exploiting techniques developed in weather and climate predictions and refining them, we have been able to improve the attribution of extreme events by taking into account the reliability of the systems used. These techniques can be refined to take into account different sources of unreliability, but it is clear that the attribution community can go a long way if it works closely with other communities concerned by this type of model error.</p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a broader perspective, this study presents an example of how extreme event attribution could benefit from the experience in weather and climate forecasting. Bridging the prediction and event attribution community could enable a better understanding of the models’ ability to represent the processes that lead to the occurrence of climate extremes. For instance, it has been regular practice in forecasting to disentangle drivers of a specific high impact event, using methods that allow to prescribe the observed atmospheric conditions that prevailed during the event or before it occurred

  </span>. The inability to capture past extreme events under these protocols can serve as an additional guidance on which kind of events we have sufficient confidence to carry out event attribution studies for.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now urgent for the scientific community to more properly address model limitations in event attribution studies because of the increasing public attention to and trust in the scientific community formulating robust attribution assessments. Adopting this practice will lead us to a more robust assessment of the human role on past extreme events for the upcoming assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and for the rising demand from media and international organisations such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC).</p>
