  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The simulations use observed SST and sea–ice conditions as boundary conditions from which a climate change signal is removed in the simulations using natural forcings alone. The observational reference used to determine the reliability and calibrate the ensemble are two-metre temperature from CRUTS3.21
