 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The odds of extreme weather and climate events are changing. There is today overwhelming evidence that human activity impacts extreme heat and rain

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. This finding is playing a key role in establishing public awareness of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> and in taking policy decisions for climate adaptation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. To what degree human influence was responsible for recent high-impact events is, therefore, of high public concern. This question is increasingly being addressed by an emerging research field designated as extreme event attribution
  <span class="sup">

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Event attribution aims to estimate, whether and to what degree, natural and anthropogenic drivers have favoured the occurrence of a past event from a probabilistic point of view
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Single-extreme weather and climate events are unique—they happen only once in the exact same manner and their probability is. therefore. strictly speaking infinitely small, which inhibits any attribution. However, single events can be described as part of classes of events, e.g., regionally constrained exceedance of a geophysical variable over a specific threshold, for which probabilities can be attached (for instance the probability to exceed the extreme 2-m air temperature observed over Europe during the summer 2003
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>). Discerning external factors in these probabilities has been the objective of diverse event attribution methods relying on model simulations that allow to compute event probabilities in the presence or absence of external forcings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One limitation that concerns all the state-of-the-art approaches is the model ability to reliably simulate the probabilities of extreme events and the changes thereof
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. By model reliability, we mean here a specific statistical condition: simulated probabilities are said to be reliable if they truly reflect the observed frequencies (within uncertainties). For example, considering all the cases where a hot summer is simulated with 20% probability, a hot summer should also occur in 20% of these cases for a model to be considered reliable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. This concept of reliability originates from forecasting weather and climate where trustworthy forecast probabilities are of paramount importance for decision-making
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Event attribution does not aim to predict a specific event, but rather quantify how an external driver has changed its likelihood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Model simulations used in event attribution are, therefore, typically evaluated for the accuracy of their mean state and different modes of variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, as well as their ability to reproduce the physical processes involved
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, which is generally thought to be enough for a trustworthy extreme event attribution. A small number of attribution studies assessed model reliability in the past to support or discard a statement
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, but they remained a clear exception in the current literature and usually did not go beyond a sole assessment of reliability for evaluation purposes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we challenge the current practice insufficiently accounting for reliability, by demonstrating that it is not only unjustified but also carries the risk of issuing overly strong attribution statements (for extreme events). To demonstrate this, we explore to which extent climate variability and long-term response to forcing are reliably represented in model simulations commonly used for event attribution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. We propose subsequently a way to correct for such shortcomings, exploiting advanced model correction techniques developed in weather and near-term climate forecasting. Finally, we show its impact on event attribution statements. This study advances the current literature two-fold: by demonstrating the crucial role reliability plays in an event attribution context and, in particular, by offering an approach that can cope with potentially unreliable model simulations with the goal to provide robust attribution statements.
