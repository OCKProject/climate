 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low reliability in ensemble simulations is a pervasive problem in weather and climate forecasting
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. A range of methods referred to as ensemble calibration have therefore been proposed to overcome this deficiency
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. These approaches are promising tools for the formulation of trustworthy event attribution statements, as we show in the following. Ensemble calibration corrects the model response to prevailing conditions for example as part of interannual climate variability (implicitly simulated by the model, e.g., an El Niño state) as a function of the model’s ability to simulate the response to these (technically as a function of the reliability). This implies a correction of the ensemble spread (often a widening but also a narrowing is sometimes required) and a correction of the amplitude of the ensemble mean signal that deviates from the climatological state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. In doing so, the model ensemble becomes more reliable, i.e., more trustworthy from a probabilistic point of view.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of event attribution, it is fundamental that the model response to the external driver, to which we aim to establish a causal link, is retained after the calibration. This is a concern in traditional approaches since the ensemble is simultaneously calibrated for short-term and long-term variabilities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Here, we propose a forecast calibration technique that can cope with this difficulty. The approach relies on the ensemble inflation (see Methods) and corrects the ensemble separately for near-term variations (forced for instance by interannual SST variations or volcanic eruptions) and long-term trends (forced for instance by greenhouse gas concentration changes). Note that the climate simulations analysed here all use observed SST as ocean surface boundary conditions, which prescribes low-frequency variability in the model simulations in phase with variability in the observations. Trend differences over the 50-year period would, therefore, primarily be due to different responses to anthropogenic forcing as opposed to climate variability. However, other more comprehensive approaches
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> would be relevant in a coupled-model setup or in presence of a highly nonlinear temporal changes in response to anthropogenic forcing. The long-term trend is only corrected for the ensemble including the anthropogenic forcings since no observations are available for a world without climate change. Also note that typical methods that correct the mean state of the simulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span> (known as bias-correction methods) would not be able to correct the reliability illustrated in the example in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> since the errors in the ensemble response differ from year to year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of the forecast calibration is illustrated across all three figures (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>–
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In the example provided for Sudan (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the calibration corrects both the ensemble mean and the spread (the long-term trend remains almost unaffected), which yields higher levels of reliability and greatly improves the rank histogram for the example (inset in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, panel b). A lower value of FAR is obtained as a consequence. The change of FAR on a global scale is illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. Over many regions the calibration reduces the FAR but there are also regions where FAR is underestimated by the raw model output as, e.g., Central Europe or Brazil. The overall change of FAR results from the correction of both the near-term response (ensemble correction) and the long-term change (linear trend over 50 years). The contribution from each component, as well as the impact on the risk ratio shown in the supplementary information (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1, 2</a>). In the example provided, correcting the near-term response particularly impacts the result over the tropics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, while correcting the response to long-term forcing most strongly affects the mid-latitudes. The supplementary information further shows consistent results when using a different physical variable and a different return-period (JJA precipitation in a 1-in-10 year event, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and an application of the calibration on artificial attribution data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, which demonstrates that the calibration perfectly corrects the reliability and FAR in an idealised context (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the additional analysis supports the conclusions of the study, it does not claim to be exhaustive and further applications may need to test the approach for other types of events. The current proposed method is generic, since it corrects the entire model distribution, which is advantageous compared to quantile-specific calibration approaches. However, the method might for instance not be suitable to correct a highly non-linear response to anthropogenic forcing or to correct heavily skewed native model distributions, and non-parametric approaches might be useful in such cases. Also, physical deficiencies of general circulation models as for instance the correct positioning of the storm tracks are unlikely corrected by this approach and hence calibration always be complemented with an evaluation of the model’s ability to simulate the underlying physical processes
