  <p>Reliability of event attribution experiments to simulate probabilities of high temperatures during boreal summers. The reliability measures the accuracy of simulated probabilities and a value of one denotes perfect reliability (see methods reliability assessment). Reliability is shown for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> the single-model ensemble of the UK quasi-operational attribution system (HadGEM3-A), 
   <span class="bold">b</span> the single-model system (HadGEM3-A) after the ensemble calibration, 
   <span class="bold">c</span> the multi-model event attribution system of Climate of the 20th Century Plus project (C20C+) and
