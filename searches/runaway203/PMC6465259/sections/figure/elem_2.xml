  <p>Effect of the model ensemble calibration on the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) to anthropogenic forcings of boreal hot summers. The change denotes the FAR calculated after the calibration minus the FAR calculated from the raw HadGEM3-A, as illustrated in Fig.Â 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> but on a global scale. The model probabilities are estimated by fitting a Normal distribution to all ensemble members. Stippling denotes a significant change in FAR determined by resampling at a 10% significance level
