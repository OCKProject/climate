  <p>Effect of ensemble calibration on an attribution case for boreal hot summers for a grid point in Sudan (12.6°N, 34.4°W). Panels 
   <span class="bold">a</span> and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> show the observed historical evolution of summer temperatures (black, two different datasets) and the single-model ensemble of the UK quasi-operational attribution system (HadGEM3-A) considering all forcings (red) and only natural forcings (blue) as anomalies from present day climatology (1981–2010) derived from the all forcings ensemble. Panels 
   <span class="bold">c</span> and 
   <span class="bold">d</span> show the probability distribution of temperature and the associated fraction of attributable risk (FAR) due to climate change (distribution red opposed to the blue one) for a 1 in 5-year event in the NAT simulation (
