  <p>The changes in concentrate feeds for poultry, pigs, and ruminants, and in the composition of feeds for ruminants over the period of 1961–2012. The concentrate feeds for poultry, pigs, and ruminants are presented as stacked area chart in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>). The feeds for ruminants are concentrates (including all crop concentrate feed commodities for ruminants, C3-based or C4-based), grass (including C3 and C4 grasses), and other feeds (i.e., stover and occasional including C3 and C4 part) following ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. The light and dark green lines in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) show the mean amount of C3 and C4 other feeds consumed by ruminants estimated in this study derived from Monte Carlo ensembles (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1000) from the range of uncertainty reported on feed digestibilities (i.e., 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>DE-s+o</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>DE-concentrates</sub>, and 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>DE-grass</sub>; see Methods section) and on the fraction of digestible energy available in diet used for maintenance (REMs; REM parameter values themselves dependent on 
   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>DE</sub>; see Methods). The green shaded areas show the 95% confidence interval of the estimates. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
