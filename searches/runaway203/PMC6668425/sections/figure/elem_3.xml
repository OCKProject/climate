  <p>The changes in the regional methane emissions from enteric fermentation of ruminants (

   <span class="sup">13</span>C
   <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> over the period of 1961–2012. The blue and red solid lines show the mean value of livestock emissions and their δ

   <sub>CH4</sub> from this study, respectively. The blue and red shaded areas give the 95% confidence interval of those estimates. The red dashed lines show the δ
