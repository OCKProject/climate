 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global livestock feed data, including concentrates, grasses, stover, and occasional feeds, are available only for the year 2000
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. In this study, we reconstruct the consumption of concentrate crop feeds consumed by ruminant, the grazing of grass-biomass, and inferred the consumption of stover and occasional (other feeds) biomass as a residual to meet the metabolic energy requirement of the whole ruminant production sector over the period of 1961–2012 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For 2000, we estimate that ruminants consumed 33% of the total concentrate feeds (317 Mt), 11% higher than the value given by ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> (284 Mt). The difference could be due to the uncertainty in the feeds estimate for poultry and pigs in this study. The uncertainty could come from the feed conversion ratios (FCR) used here. For developed countries, we applied the FCR of poultry production derived from the industrial broiler system of the United States (intensive system with relatively low FCR). The FCRs of developing countries are assumed to be 20% higher than those of developed countries (derived from the FCR difference for pig production between the United States and China). On one hand, the FCR of poultry production other than broiler (like other types of chicken, duck, and turkey) is assumed to be the same as that of industrial broiler, which could bring uncertainty to the feed estimates. On the other hand, industrial and smallholder systems are assumed to have the same FCR for production in the simple feed model, due to the lack of the FCR information for smallholder system. Usually, smallholder system tends to have higher FCR than industrial system. This will cause the low feed requirement estimated by the simple feed model. In addition, the uncertainty could be due to the assumed proportion of backyard production that did not receive feed commodities collected in statistics (see Methods). In a simulation assuming that all poultry and pig productions receive feed commodities, the simple feed model estimates poultry and pigs consumed 78% of the total concentrate feeds (1013 Mt), with 22% eaten by ruminants (110 Mt).
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, concentrate feeds comprised &lt;10% of the total dry matter consumption by ruminants in the 2000s. The grass feed fraction in 2000 used in this study was directly derived from ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Stover and occasional feed used by ruminants is clearly the most uncertain term of the feed equation. They were estimated to be 1098 Mt in average for 2000, close to the estimate of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> (1131 Mt). But our estimates have large uncertainty ranging from 477 to 1976 Mt (95% confidence interval) due to the large uncertainty in digestibility of feeds. In summary, the simple feed model and assumptions on feed digestibility of ruminants’ feed can generally reproduce livestock feed consumptions at global scale well compared with ref.

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> was calculated based on IPCC Tier 2 methods.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. However, discrepancies exist between estimates using different methods and input data. IPCC Tier 2 method considers gross and net energy requirement and associated feed intake by different livestock categories (cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats) and sub-categories (dairy of non-dairy), and digestible energy availability of the diet (i.e., feed digestibility). For IPCC Tier 1 method, default emission factors for non-cattle livestock are from literature with indicated live-weight (see Tables 10.10 of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, Vol. 4, Chapter 10, pp. 10.28), and default region-specific emission factors for cattle used in a Tier 1 method (Tables 10.11 of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, Vol. 4, Chapter 10, pp. 10.29) are derived in fact from Tier 2 method and the data in Tables 10 A.1 and 10A.2 of ref.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, Vol. 4, Chapter 10, pp. 10.72–10.75, which embodies livestock characteristics adjudged by expert opinions. Expert opinion necessarily limits confidence in those default emission factors to be representative of all cattle in large regions such as Africa, Middle East, and Asia. Compared with Tier 1 method, Tier 2 method (if related active data like body weight and feed digestibility are used) should allow a more accurate estimate of feed intake which is an important variable in estimating methane production from enteric fermentation (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>

  </span>. Given the fact that concentrate feeds comprised only around 10% of the total ruminant feeds (see Results section), the C4 diet fraction in ruminant diet mainly depends on C3–C4 distribution of local feeds. As a result, larger increase in ruminants over tropical and sub-tropical regions (where C4 plant is relatively more dominant) compared with that of temperate regions, is the main cause of the global increase in the C4 diet fraction in the ruminant diet between 1960s and 2000s.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Latin America and Caribbean has the highest C4 diet fraction (Supplementary Fig.

This region makes the major contribution to the global increase in C4 diet fraction. The C4 diet also comprises a significant part of ruminant diet in the United States, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East and Southeast Asia. Local C4 feeds are the dominant component of the C4 diet in these regions except the United States and China. C4 concentrates comprise 19% and 21% of the total ruminant feeds in the United States and China during the 1980s, respectively. However, due to the fast growth of poultry and pig numbers, more C4 concentrates in these two countries are used for poultry and pigs with less for ruminants simulated by our simple feed model. Thus, the C4 diet fractions in these two countries decreased in the past two decades.

This net small trend over 50 years is the result of two opposite mechanisms the increasing proportion of C4 grass and feeds (occasional and stover) consumed by ruminants (Fig.

Uncertainties in the feed conversion ratio have been discussed above. Besides, there could be uncertainties from other aspects. For example, the simple feed model is based on diet composition of Germany, which could cause inevitable uncertainties in the C3–C4 feed composition of pigs and poultry, and further affects uncertainties in C3–C4 concentrate feed for ruminants. There are also uncertainties in our assumptions on the logistic intensification and constant farming intensity of pig and poultry production in developing and developed countries, respectively, which will affect the time evolution of the concentrate feeds consumption by pigs and poultry. However, these uncertainties are currently not accessible due to lack of national-specific information on diet and farming intensity, and their historical changes.</p>

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> revisions have significant impacts on δ

 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the revised

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> alone (light blue line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>) produces a larger mean δ

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> alone produces a lower mean value of δ

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> has a very small effect on reconstructed δ

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1990 to 2012, the box model prescribed with the revised

  </span>). In conclusion, the box-model simulations have two main implications. Firstly, the revised CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from ruminants have compensated δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-atm</sub> trend that could have otherwise increased more largely driven by the increasing fossil-fuel-related emissions. Secondly, the revised δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> to lower values gives a larger role of ruminant emissions in the recent δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-atm</sub> trend than previously estimated, consistent with the results from ref.
