  </span> provides annual national statistics on live animal stocks, numbers of slaughtered animal and laying poultry, milking animals (producing milk) and slaughtered animals (producing meat), and correspondent milk yield for milking animals (dairy cows, sheep, goats, and buffaloes for milk), meat yield (carcass weight) for meat animals (i.e., poultry, pigs, beef cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes for meat), and egg yield for laying poultry. In this study, poultry species include chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and other birds from FAOSTAT. Data of the period 1961–2012 were used in this study.
