  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> decreased by −0.3‰ and −1.9‰ in the United States and China, respectively. In these two countries, the increase in poultry and pig numbers consumed most crop feeds, including maize, so that only few C4 crops feed became allocated to ruminants. The lower fraction of C4 diet explained the decrease of δ

  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> in these two countries. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the average δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> showed a strong decrease of −1.8‰ and −1.2‰, respectively. More C4 crop feed was used there to feed the increasing poultry numbers (i.e., less C4 crops left for ruminant). By contrast, δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> significantly increased from the 1960s to the 2000s in Brazil (+0.3‰), Argentina (+0.5‰) and Australia (+0.5‰), which are major livestock producing countries. This increase in the source signature is explained by the combined effect of increased C4 crop feed and C4 pasture grazing.
