  </span>. Understanding the global methane budget and its sources is crucial for climate mitigation efforts. Both process-based (bottom-up) and atmospheric-based (top-down) methods are used to constrain the sources and sinks of methane. However, large uncertainties exist in both approaches, which limits the complete understanding of the global methane budget.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements of atmospheric methane concentrations, including their trend and gradients between stations of the surface in situ network, together with a priori spatial and temporal patterns of source type information are used by atmospheric inversion systems to produce optimized estimates of broad source categories (the Global Carbon Project
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> revised the δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C of methane sources and concluded that microbial sources, including wetlands, rice paddies, ruminant enteric fermentation and waste emissions, have a mean δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C

For example, the observed plateau of atmospheric methane concentration during 1999–2006, the renewed concentration-rise after 2006, and associated δ

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> (Vol. 4, Chapter 10.3) to estimate national to global enteric methane emissions. The Tier 1 method that uses the livestock population data and default emission factors, the Tier 2 approach uses a more detailed country-specific data on gross energy intake and methane conversion factors for specific livestock categories, and the Tier 3 approach allows detailed parameterization of rumen fermentation. Given the large magnitude of ruminant emissions (F
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub>), its δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C (δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub>) needs to be assessed as precisely as possible regionally for constraining the global mix of emissions using inversion models driven by atmospheric CH
  <sub>4</sub> and isotope data.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photosynthesis pathways differentiate C3 and C4 plants
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. C4 plants contain more 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C than C3 plants relative to 
  <span class="sup">12</span>C. This difference in isotopic ratio causes methane emissions from ruminants with a higher C4 diet to be isotopically heavier (less negative δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4</sub>) than those with a C3 diet. Therefore, to assess the δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub>, it is critical to first differentiate the C3 vs. C4 feed composition in ruminant diet. To our knowledge, the proportions of C3 vs. C4 crops fed to ruminants (as concentrate feeds), as opposed to pig and poultry and their temporal changes, have not been investigated at national and global scale, since FAOSTAT only provides total feed crops for all livestock types grouped together. In addition, given the fact that C4 photosynthetic pathway predominates in warm season/low precipitation grass species, the strong increase in livestock number in tropical regions, such as South America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, should also increase the value of δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> (i.e., heavier). Few studies have considered the impacts of shifting C4–C3 diet composition in 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C constraints on the global CH
  <sub>4</sub> budget. Reference 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> estimated a global weighted mean δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>CH4-ruminant</sub> value of −66.8 ± 2.8‰ using an observation-based C4–C3 diet fraction of the United States only and made assumptions for the rest of the world. The spatial distribution and temporal trends of livestock δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we establish a global, time-dependent dataset at national scale of the C3–C4 diet composition of domestic ruminants, the enteric methane emissions (F

  <span class="sup">13</span>C
