 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is the first to reveal the MJO impact on Antarctic sea ice extent. During austral winter, the MJO convection anomaly exists over the equator and the Northern Hemisphere subtropics. Rossby waves emitted from the MJO propagate into the Southern Hemisphere through the two northerly ducts, which are located over the western Indian Ocean–central Africa and the Maritime Continent. The waves develop a teleconnection pattern, reaching the polar sea ice region. The enhanced and suppressed convection over the Indian Ocean and western North Pacific, respectively (e.g., MJO phase 2), produces a cyclonic circulation over the RS and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas at phases 3–4. The anomalous circulation is responsible for the sea ice extent anomaly, with an increase in the MD and a decrease in the RS. Meanwhile, the enhanced convection over the Indian subcontinent and Maritime Continent, representing MJO phase 4, induces an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the MD and a cyclonic one over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and AP at phases 5–6, causing an increase in the sea ice extent in the RS and EW and a decrease in the AP. The physical processes are schematically summarized in Fig.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The anomalous circulation generates the temperature advection by the meridional wind anomaly that modulates the sea ice variation. That is, the meridional wind anomaly leads to a temperature change within a day, while the latter tends to produce sea ice melting or freezing during the next 4 days. As the MJO propagates eastward from the Indian Ocean to the western North Pacific, the teleconnection also shifts to the east (which is due to a more zonally symmetric subtropical jet in the Southern Hemisphere compared to that of the Northern Hemisphere; this will be reported in other studies). Following the high-latitude circulation anomaly, the sea ice extent anomaly exhibits eastward-migrating behavior as well. It is suggested that the induced circulation pattern over the sea ice region near Antarctic is nearly antisymmetric for the opposite MJO convective forcing.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraseasonal variability of the sea ice extent accounts for up to 29% of the total variation in the sea ice extent. Although the amount seems to be rather small, this may have an implication on the real prediction of the sea ice extent using the MJO phase because the change in the total sea ice extent anomaly is also synchronous to the evolution of the MJO.</p>
