 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 25 × 25 km gridded ice concentration data provided in the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) are used. The data are derived by the brightness temperature field obtained from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS. Missing values in the data are replaced by linear temporal interpolation. Using the sea ice concentration, the sea ice extent is calculated by summing the areas of the grid cells where the sea ice concentration is greater than 15%. The local sea ice extent is reinterpolated into a regular 2.5° × 2.5° grid and meridionally summed over the Southern Hemisphere. The local sea ice extent is linearly detrended before analysis to exclude the global warming effect. The daily outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are utilized as a proxy for the tropical deep convection. For other atmospheric variables such as circulation and near surface temperature, the ERA-Interim reanalysis data provided by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used

  </span>. All obtained variables has 2.5° horizontal resolution. Intraseasonal variability for each variable is obtained by removing the annual cycle, which is calculated as the first three harmonics of the calendar mean cycle, and then by applying a 20–90-day Lanczos bandpass filter. Only austral winter, from June to August [JJA], is considered for the period of 1979 to 2015.
