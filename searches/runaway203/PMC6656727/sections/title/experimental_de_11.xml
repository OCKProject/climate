 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the circulation response to the MJO, a numerical experiment is performed using an atmospheric linear baroclinic model (LBM) with T42 horizontal resolution and 20 vertical levels in sigma coordinates. The LBM is based on the primitive equations and its code is available from http://ccsr.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~lbm/sub/lbm.html. The horizontal diffusion is set such that the 
  <span class="italic">e</span>-holding decay time of 6 h for the largest wavenumber, and the vertical diffusion is set with a damping time scale of 1000 days to suppress the vertical computational mode. The time scale of linear drag, which mimics Rayleigh friction and Newtonian damping, is set to 0.5 days for the lowest three levels, 1 day for the topmost two levels, and 20 days for the mid-levels. The experiment is initialized with the JJA-climatological background state, which contains the 3-dimensional wind, temperature, geopotential height, specific humidity, and mean sea level pressure. To imitate the MJO convection in the experiment, the areas where the OLR is greater (lesser) than 10 (−10) W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in the composite map are chosen as diabatic cooling (heating). Since the MJO convection is not spatially stationary, the diabatic forcing is given for the first 7 days and then turned off. Note that the simulated circulation fields have weaker intensity than that observed due to the switching-off of the forcing. If the forcing is persistently applied, the intensity is similar to that of the observation, although the circulation pattern in the subtropics is somewhat different than that indicated from the observation.
