  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> shows the spatial pattern of the JJA-mean sea ice concentration (shading in the uppermost plot) and the standard deviations of the total and 20–90-day filtered sea ice extent anomalies (middle and lower plots in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The austral winter climatological sea ice concentration pattern shows that the areas with the greatest concentration occur over the Ross and Weddell Seas (upper plot in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), where the standard deviations of total sea ice extent anomaly are also large (middle panel in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The intraseasonal variability of the sea ice extent presents larger standard deviations in West Antarctica than in East Antarctica (lower panel in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The averaged standard deviation is 0.0066 × 10

  <span class="sup">2</span> in West Antarctica and 0.0056 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in East Antarctica. The intraseasonal variability accounts for up to 29% of the total variation in the sea ice extent regionally, and on average it explains 20% of the total variation in the Antarctic region (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the MJO impact on Antarctic sea ice and its physical processes, we plot the composites of the filtered sea ice extent anomaly (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) and those of the atmospheric variables averaged over the high latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,d</a>) for eight MJO phases. A considerable decrease in the sea ice extent is exhibited in the following regions (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>): 90°E–150°E (Mawson-Dumont d’Urville Seas; MD) in phases 6–8 and 1, 150°E–120°W (Ross Seas; RS) in phases 2–4, 90°W–30°W (sea near the Antarctic Peninsula; AP) in phases 5–7, and 20°W–0°E (eastern Weddell Sea; EW) in phases 1–2. In contrast, a significant increase in the sea ice arises in the same regions at different phases, e.g., MD in phases 3–4, RS in phase 7, AP in phase 2, and EW in phases 3–6. Note that the sea ice extent anomaly displays an eastward propagation as the MJO evolves. This eastward migration is suggestive of the contribution by the eastward moving circulation anomaly generated by the MJO, as seen in Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>. The circulation response develops anomalous low-level meridional wind (contour in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>)—northerly (southerly) to the east (west) of the cyclonic circulation and west (east) of the anticyclonic circulation, inducing the advection of warm and cold air into the Antarctic region (contour in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) and, therefore, the temperature variations (shaded in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A temporal difference seems to exist between the sea ice extent and atmospheric variables (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b–d</a>). A lead-lag correlation analysis shows that the sea ice extent anomaly correlates significantly with the meridional wind and temperature anomalies with lags of 5 and 4 days, respectively, on Antarctic (with correlation coefficients of 0.55 and −0.37, respectively), although a regional difference exists (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). That is, over the high latitudes, the circulation anomaly caused by the MJO forcing induces the temperature anomaly after a day and the sea ice anomaly after 5 days. This is consistent with previous studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> that demonstrated that a spatial phase difference appears between the meridional wind and sea ice anomalies, with the former leading the latter by 5 days. The above analysis clearly demonstrates that the atmospheric anomaly drives the sea ice variation.
