  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the MJO convection and circulation response, a composite analysis of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and 250-hPa geopotential height anomalies is performed with respect to the MJO index (see the Methods section for details about the composite and the definition of the index). During austral winter (June–August, JJA), MJO convection moves northward or northeastward with a northwest-to-southeast-tilted structure. The MJO lifecycle is divided into 8 phases according to their convection location (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–i</a>)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>. Enhanced (suppressed) convection arises over the Indian Ocean in phase 1 (5) and disappears over the western North Pacific (i.e., South China Sea) in phase 8 (4). When the dipole convection anomalies are located over the Indian Ocean and western North Pacific (e.g., phases 2 and 7), the Pacific-South America (PSA)-like teleconnection pattern develops in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (black solid lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c,h</a>)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. This wave train seems to start from Australia and proceed into the Drake Passage (see the geographical location in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), featuring an anticlockwise propagation pattern. Meanwhile, at phases 4 and 8 at which the convection anomalies exist over the Indian subcontinent and Maritime Continent, a wave train arising from Madagascar and propagating toward the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas (black lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e,i</a>) appears.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, as the MJO advances eastward, the MJO-induced circulation anomaly in the high latitudes (approximately from 80° S to 50° S) also propagates eastward. For example, a cyclonic circulation anomaly (black square in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–i</a>) over the Dumont d’Urville Sea in phase 8 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1i</a>) migrates toward the east during the subsequent phases (i.e., phases 1–6, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–g</a>), finally reaching the Weddell Sea in phase 7 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1h</a>). Similarly, an anticyclonic circulation anomaly (white square) exhibits behavior analogous to that described above, with different starting phases (i.e., starting over the Dumont d’Urville Sea at phase 4 and migrating eastward afterwards) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e–i,b–d</a>), but more irregular than the cyclonic counterpart. The impact of the circulation response on Antarctic sea ice extent is demonstrated in the next subsection, and the formation mechanism of the circulation anomalies is described in the third subsection.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the MJO impact on Antarctic sea ice and its physical processes, we plot the composites of the filtered sea ice extent anomaly (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) and those of the atmospheric variables averaged over the high latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,d</a>) for eight MJO phases. A considerable decrease in the sea ice extent is exhibited in the following regions (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>): 90°E–150°E (Mawson-Dumont d’Urville Seas; MD) in phases 6–8 and 1, 150°E–120°W (Ross Seas; RS) in phases 2–4, 90°W–30°W (sea near the Antarctic Peninsula; AP) in phases 5–7, and 20°W–0°E (eastern Weddell Sea; EW) in phases 1–2. In contrast, a significant increase in the sea ice arises in the same regions at different phases, e.g., MD in phases 3–4, RS in phase 7, AP in phase 2, and EW in phases 3–6. Note that the sea ice extent anomaly displays an eastward propagation as the MJO evolves. This eastward migration is suggestive of the contribution by the eastward moving circulation anomaly generated by the MJO, as seen in Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>. The circulation response develops anomalous low-level meridional wind (contour in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>)—northerly (southerly) to the east (west) of the cyclonic circulation and west (east) of the anticyclonic circulation, inducing the advection of warm and cold air into the Antarctic region (contour in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) and, therefore, the temperature variations (shaded in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A temporal difference seems to exist between the sea ice extent and atmospheric variables (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b–d</a>). A lead-lag correlation analysis shows that the sea ice extent anomaly correlates significantly with the meridional wind and temperature anomalies with lags of 5 and 4 days, respectively, on Antarctic (with correlation coefficients of 0.55 and −0.37, respectively), although a regional difference exists (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). That is, over the high latitudes, the circulation anomaly caused by the MJO forcing induces the temperature anomaly after a day and the sea ice anomaly after 5 days. This is consistent with previous studies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span> that demonstrated that a spatial phase difference appears between the meridional wind and sea ice anomalies, with the former leading the latter by 5 days. The above analysis clearly demonstrates that the atmospheric anomaly drives the sea ice variation.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To demonstrate the dynamic mechanism by which the MJO generates the anomalous circulation in the Antarctic region, we performed a numerical experiment (see Experimental design). Because it takes about two weeks for the circulation response to tropical convection to reach the high latitudes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>, diabatic forcing preceding two MJO phases is imposed. The simulated upper-tropospheric geopotential height anomaly is plotted by averaging the model simulations of 15–20 days. The results show similar wave train-like anomalies to the observations for all eight MJO phases, although the centers of the circulation anomalies are slightly biased westward (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Hereafter, we focus on the response to the forcings of MJO phases 2 and 4, but the same formation mechanism operates in MJO phases 6 and 8 with a sign reversal.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result of the model experiment shows that the MJO phase-2 forcing (e.g., enhanced convection over the Indian Ocean and suppressed convection over the western North Pacific) generates a teleconnection pattern, with the anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the MD and the cyclonic circulation anomaly over the RS and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). This pattern resembles the circulation anomalies observed at phases 3 and 4 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d,e</a>), although observation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d,e</a>) does not indicate an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the AP or Drake Passage simulated in the model. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,c</a> exhibits the circulation anomaly in response to monopole forcing. Interestingly, the opposite forcing induces the same signed circulation anomalies over nearly the same location, especially at high latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,c</a>). However, the suppressed convection over the western North Pacific (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>) is more responsible for the generation of the total circulation anomaly (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) than the enhanced convection over the Indian Ocean (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). To identify the path of wave energy activity, the ray tracing technique is conducted based on nondivergent barotropic Rossby wave theory (see the Methods section for more details). The waves emitted from the convection over the western North Pacific propagate southward across the equator and reach the Antarctic region (red lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Some waves cross the equator near central Africa, while other waves penetrate via the Maritime Continent. The waves starting from the convection over the Indian Ocean propagate southwestward over central Africa and then travel southeastward (blue lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).

  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the MJO phase-4 forcing (e.g., enhanced convection over the Indian subcontinent/Maritime Continent and weak suppressed convection over the western North Pacific) produces anticyclonic circulation over the MD and cyclonic circulation over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and AP (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>), similar to the circulation anomalies contemporaneously found at phases 5 and 6 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1f,g</a>). Separate forcing experiments (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e,f</a>) show that enhanced convection (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>) produces circulation anomalies similar to the total circulation response (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). Wave rays (blue lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>) seem to behave as those represented by the red lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>, as the two are located in similar areas. In fact, however, the waves emanating from the enhanced convection cross the equator near the Maritime continent (not the western Indian Ocean) to reach high latitudes. This suggests that the wave train shifts eastward as the MJO phase proceeds. The suppressed convection is too weak to generate circulation response, as seen in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>. Note that antisymmetric circulation and sea ice anomalies develop at MJO phases 6 and 8 with respect to phases 2 and 4.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the linear model simulations show that the high-latitude circulation anomaly propagates eastward as does the diabatic forcing (Supplementary Fig.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> summarizes the formation mechanism and the resulting change in sea ice extent. As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,c,e</a>, two dominant wave passages, referred to as the northerly ducts, are identified at the equator: the western Indian Ocean–central Africa and the Maritime Continent (green arrows in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). These northerly ducts allow waves to propagate from the Northern Hemisphere into the Southern Hemisphere. This is possible since the dispersion relationship for the barotropic Rossby wave now includes the effect of the basic meridional flow and, thus, the waves can penetrate the tropical easterly region

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown that on the intraseasonal time scale, the MJO induces the sea ice variation through Rossby wave propagation. Thus, a question arises as to whether the above physical process can be utilized in real prediction of the melting of Antarctic sea ice. For this, we use the total sea ice anomaly rather than the intraseasonally filtered anomaly. First, strong sea ice melting cases are selected based on events in which the sea ice extent anomaly is less than –1.0 standard deviations. Second, for lead and lag days, the percentage of occurrence number of the MJO phase is calculated for the four regions: the MD, RS, AP, and EW, as shown in Fig.
