 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown that on the intraseasonal time scale, the MJO induces the sea ice variation through Rossby wave propagation. Thus, a question arises as to whether the above physical process can be utilized in real prediction of the melting of Antarctic sea ice. For this, we use the total sea ice anomaly rather than the intraseasonally filtered anomaly. First, strong sea ice melting cases are selected based on events in which the sea ice extent anomaly is less than –1.0 standard deviations. Second, for lead and lag days, the percentage of occurrence number of the MJO phase is calculated for the four regions: the MD, RS, AP, and EW, as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, where lag day 0 is defined as the peak melting day.

    <p>Prediction of probability of the sea ice extent decrease depending on MJO phases. Percentage of occurrence number of the MJO phases for four regions: (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) MD, (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) RS, (
     <span class="bold">c</span>) AP, and (
     <span class="bold">d</span>) EW as a function of lead or lag days relative to the date at which the total sea ice extent anomaly is smaller than −1.0 standard deviations and has a minimum value. The black solid (white dashed) line represents the approximated melting (freezing) dates estimated from day 0. Day 0 is determined from the peak melting (freezing) phase shown in the intraseasonally filtered sea ice extent anomaly (Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Then, the line is extended by considering that the time interval between adjacent MJO phases is 5 days.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The linearly approximated melting dates by the MJO effect are expressed as black solid lines for the lead and lag days (see the caption of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> for the detailed definition of black solid line). The figure shows that over the MD, AP and EW, high percentage values tend to appear along the black line, indicating that ice melting over these regions can be predicted much earlier than at day 0 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a,c,d</a>). Meanwhile, this kind of evolution pattern is not prominent in the case of the RS (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). It is likely that the sea ice over the RS is more affected by lower frequency forcings like those on the interannual time scales

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. In addition, the figure shows that on the whole, for all regions, the MJO phase at which a high percentage is recorded at day 0 matches those MJO phases at which the peak intraseasonal sea ice reduction (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) occurs.
