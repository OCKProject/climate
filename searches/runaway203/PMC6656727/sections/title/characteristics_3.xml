 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the MJO convection and circulation response, a composite analysis of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and 250-hPa geopotential height anomalies is performed with respect to the MJO index (see the Methods section for details about the composite and the definition of the index). During austral winter (June–August, JJA), MJO convection moves northward or northeastward with a northwest-to-southeast-tilted structure. The MJO lifecycle is divided into 8 phases according to their convection location (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–i</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Enhanced (suppressed) convection arises over the Indian Ocean in phase 1 (5) and disappears over the western North Pacific (i.e., South China Sea) in phase 8 (4). When the dipole convection anomalies are located over the Indian Ocean and western North Pacific (e.g., phases 2 and 7), the Pacific-South America (PSA)-like teleconnection pattern develops in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (black solid lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c,h</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. This wave train seems to start from Australia and proceed into the Drake Passage (see the geographical location in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), featuring an anticlockwise propagation pattern. Meanwhile, at phases 4 and 8 at which the convection anomalies exist over the Indian subcontinent and Maritime Continent, a wave train arising from Madagascar and propagating toward the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas (black lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e,i</a>) appears.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, as the MJO advances eastward, the MJO-induced circulation anomaly in the high latitudes (approximately from 80° S to 50° S) also propagates eastward. For example, a cyclonic circulation anomaly (black square in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–i</a>) over the Dumont d’Urville Sea in phase 8 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1i</a>) migrates toward the east during the subsequent phases (i.e., phases 1–6, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–g</a>), finally reaching the Weddell Sea in phase 7 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1h</a>). Similarly, an anticyclonic circulation anomaly (white square) exhibits behavior analogous to that described above, with different starting phases (i.e., starting over the Dumont d’Urville Sea at phase 4 and migrating eastward afterwards) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e–i,b–d</a>), but more irregular than the cyclonic counterpart. The impact of the circulation response on Antarctic sea ice extent is demonstrated in the next subsection, and the formation mechanism of the circulation anomalies is described in the third subsection.
