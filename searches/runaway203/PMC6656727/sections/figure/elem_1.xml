  <p>Climatological features of Antarctic sea ice and response of the sea ice and atmospheric variables to the MJO in the Antarctic region. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) (upper) Spatial pattern of JJA-climatological sea ice concentration in the range of 0 to 1 (100%) and standard deviations of (middle) total and (lower) filtered sea ice extent anomalies (×10

   <span class="bold">b</span>) sea ice extent anomaly (×10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span>), (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) 250-hPa geopotential height (shading; m) and 925-hPa meridional wind (contour with intervals of 0.3 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and the zero contour is omitted) anomalies, (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) 925-hPa air temperature anomaly (shading; K) and the temperature advection by the meridional wind (contour with intervals of 0.3 K day
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and the zero contour is omitted) for eight MJO phases. All atmospheric variables are meridionally averaged from 60° to 80°S. Black and grey dots in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) indicate the significant regions at the 95% and 80% confidence level, respectively. Hatched (densely hatched) areas in (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) represent the significant shading regions at the 90% confidence level, calculated using variables averaged from 60° to 70°S (70° to 80°S, respectively).
