  <p>Prediction of probability of the sea ice extent decrease depending on MJO phases. Percentage of occurrence number of the MJO phases for four regions: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) MD, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) RS, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) AP, and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) EW as a function of lead or lag days relative to the date at which the total sea ice extent anomaly is smaller than −1.0 standard deviations and has a minimum value. The black solid (white dashed) line represents the approximated melting (freezing) dates estimated from day 0. Day 0 is determined from the peak melting (freezing) phase shown in the intraseasonally filtered sea ice extent anomaly (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Then, the line is extended by considering that the time interval between adjacent MJO phases is 5 days.
