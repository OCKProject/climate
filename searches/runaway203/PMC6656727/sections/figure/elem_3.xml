  <p>Dynamical mechanisms of MJO impact on the circulation and sea ice anomalies. Schematic illustrating the Rossby wave propagation from the MJO and formation mechanism of high-latitude circulation anomalies for the initial state of MJO (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) phase 2 and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) phase 4. The black solid and dotted circles denote anticyclonic and cyclonic circulation anomalies, respectively. Green arrows near the equator depict the two northerly ducts. P4 in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and P6 in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) denote the MJO phases at which the wave trains shown in the plots are established. The inset plot in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) is the stationary total wavenumber (
   <span class="italic">K</span>
   <sub>s</sub>), with the two black arrows representing local peaks in this wavenumber. Red (blue) thick arrows denote poleward (equatorward) wind anomalies and red (blue) hatching indicates sea ice melting (freezing) area.
