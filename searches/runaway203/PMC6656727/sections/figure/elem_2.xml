  <p>Simulated circulation anomalies in response to the MJO and Rossby wave ray path. Upper-troposphere (σ = 0.229) geopotential height anomaly (shading, zonal mean is subtracted; m) averaged over 15–20 days of model simulation in response to diabatic forcing of MJO (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) phase 2, (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) phase 4, and its monopole forcing: (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">e</span>) diabatic heating and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">f</span>) diabatic cooling. Simulated circulations correspond to the observed circulation in (left panels) phase 4 and (right panels) phase 6. Black (white) squares in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) represent centers of the high-latitude cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation anomalies in the observation, as seen in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e,g</a>. Thick red (blue) contours indicate imposed diabatic heating (cooling). In (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">e</span>), thick lines represent ray path of the Rossby waves seeded from the (red) diabatic heating and (blue) diabatic cooling regions for initial zonal wavenumber 2.
