 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many disciplines of Earth system sciences, models of the system or subsystem play a fundamental role in understanding relevant processes. Models differ regarding which subprocesses are resolved and the type of parametrization used. Biogeochemical models, for instance, help to understand element cycles and are a crucial basis for carbon-climate feedbacks in the coupled Earth system. At a higher level, climate models

  </span> simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, water bodies, land surface and the cryosphere. In all cases, and at all levels, models are based partly on differential equations representing known processes and partly on semi-empirical relationships representing unknown processes or approximating known processes that cannot be resolved at the global scale due to numerical issues

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>. Due to the nonlinear nature of the system, small differences in parameterization can potentially lead to large deviations in overall model characteristics. A key task is to evaluate which model better simulates the real system. Currently, such evaluations are based on simple descriptive statistics like mean and variance, climatologies, and spectral properties of model output and observations

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span>. However, even though a particular model might well fit descriptive statistics of the observational data, for example, the global distribution of gross primary production (GPP) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>), the model might not well simulate the physical mechanisms affecting GPP, given that multiple model formulations and parameterizations, even when wrong, can fit the observations equally well, a problem known as underdetermination or equifinality

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span>. As a complementary criterion we propose to compare reconstructed causal dependencies of models and observational data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). The underlying premise is that causal dependencies are more directly linked to the physical processes and are, therefore, more robust against overfitting than simple statistics and, hence, models that are causally similar to observations will also yield more reliable future projections. As for the previous example, also here the challenges lie in extracting suitable causal variables from often noisy station-based measurements or high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields and also the fact that processes can interact nonlinearly involving different spatio-temporal scales. In addition, model output may not satisfy the conditions underlying some causal inference methods, e.g., if dependencies are purely deterministic. Finally, suitable evaluation and comparison statistics based on causal networks need to be defined (see paragraph on causal complex network analysis). In Earth system sciences, model evaluation can help to build more realistic models to improve projections of the future, which is highly relevant for policy making
