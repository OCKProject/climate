 <p>This Perspective is accompanied by a website hosting a causality benchmark platform. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.causeme.net" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">causeme.net</span> runs a fair use data policy by which data are made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights and that global scientific problems require international cooperation. Open access means that data are freely distributed without charge. Data download is unrestricted and requires only a free registration for web security reasons. The platform is intended as a system for causal inference method intercomparison in a consistent data environment.
