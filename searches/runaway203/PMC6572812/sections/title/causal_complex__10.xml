   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>, nodes are defined as the time series at different grid locations and links are typically based on correlations between the grid point time series. A common network measure is the node degree, which quantifies the number of processes linked to a node. However, defined based on correlations, network measures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span> do not allow for a causal interpretation such as the information flow within the system

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>. Grounding network theory in causal networks allows to better interpret network measures

  </span>: an example for linear measures is reproduced in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. Like for the other generic problems, the challenges lie in high-dimensional nonlinear spatio-temporal data, and here also in a proper definition of network measures that takes into account causal interactions and accounts for the spatial definition of nodes. Causal network comparison metrics can then be utilized for a causal evaluation of physical models (see last paragraph in this section).
