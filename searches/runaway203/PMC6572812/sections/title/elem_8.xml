  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We start by illustrating the challenges associated with a key causal hypothesis testing problem in climate research. Mid-latitude weather (including extreme events) is largely determined by nonlinear dynamical interactions between jet streams, storm tracks, and low-frequency teleconnections
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>. These dynamical processes are partially not well represented in the latest climate models. Hence, understanding drivers and favorable boundary conditions of weather-determining circulation regimes is crucial to improve (sub-)seasonal predictions, evaluate climate models, and reduce uncertainty in regional climate projections
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
   </span>. Important questions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) in this context include: what drives the strength, position, and shape of the jet stream? What is the relative importance of tropical and Arctic processes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
   </span>? Uncovering causal relations from the observational record here raises a number of challenges. To name just a few, first, time series representing the climatologically relevant subprocesses need to be extracted from typically gridded spatio-temporal datasets
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
   </span>, as illustrated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>. This can, for example, be achieved by averaging over corresponding regions, defining an index describing the jet stream position, or a more data-driven approach using dimension-reduction methods
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
   </span>. Secondly, reconstructing the causal relations between these extracted variables is challenging because different nonlinear processes can interact on vastly different time scales from fast synoptic and cloud-radiative processes to multi-year variability driven by slow oceanic processes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
   </span>. Last, the distributions of climate variables, for example precipitation, are often non-Gaussian. Similar data characteristics also occur in neuroscience where first different subprocesses of the brain need to be reconstructed, e.g., from spatio-temporal electroencephalography measurements, and time series reflect a multitude of processes operating on different frequencies

     <p>Key generic problems in Earth system sciences. 
      <span class="bold">a</span> Causal hypothesis testing in climate research. The question of how the position of the jet stream depends on Arctic and tropical drivers is challenging due to different temporal scales and the spatial definition of variables (hatched regions). 
      <span class="bold">b</span> Climate network analysis attempts to describe dynamics of the Earth system using complex network theory. Basing this theory on causal network measures allows one to better interpret network properties. Here major tropical atmospheric uplifts were identified as causal gateways with strong average causal effect and average causal susceptibility in the network (more details in ref. 
      <span class="sup">
       <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
      </span>). Nodes correspond to climatic subprocesses in different regions and the lower right graph illustrates the causal network metrics for a variable 
      <span class="italic">X</span>: the average causal effect is the average change in any other component (node) induced by a one-standard-deviation increase (perturbation) in 
      <span class="italic">X</span>. Conversely, the average causal susceptibility is the average change in 
      <span class="italic">X</span> induced by perturbations in any other component. Here, the Out-Degree refers to the fraction of components significantly (at 5% level) affected by a component and correspondingly for the In-Degree. 
      <span class="bold">c</span> Identifying drivers of extreme impacts is challenging due to the typically large amount of correlated drivers compared to much fewer causally relevant drivers, that, furthermore, may only in combination have a large effect (synergy). For example, a flood might require both storm surges and precipitation to be in an extreme state. Such types of dependencies are difficult to represent with a pairwise network. 
      <span class="bold">d</span> Basing model evaluation on causal statistics allows to better identify models with similar causal interaction structure as observational data, rather than comparing averages and climatologies. Shown is gross primary production (GPP) from observations and four illustrative models where the challenge lies in the extraction of variables

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
   </span>, nodes are defined as the time series at different grid locations and links are typically based on correlations between the grid point time series.

   </span>: an example for linear measures is reproduced in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. Like for the other generic problems, the challenges lie in high-dimensional nonlinear spatio-temporal data, and here also in a proper definition of network measures that takes into account causal interactions and accounts for the spatial definition of nodes. Causal network comparison metrics can then be utilized for a causal evaluation of physical models (see last paragraph in this section).

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Earth system, as well as in many other complex systems, the most devastating impacts are often related to multiple, compound or synergistic drivers
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
   </span>. For instance, devastating wildfires need dry and hot conditions, available fuel, and an ignition source. Many impacts are related to threshold behavior
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
   </span>, and multiple drivers contribute to the tipping of the system

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
   </span>. Consider the example shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> where only the synergistic combination of extreme inland precipitation and extreme storm surge leads to coastal floods
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
   </span>. Causal inference methods can be helpful in identifying the relevant drivers from a typically large number of potential drivers that may be correlated with impacts
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
   </span>. Causal methods further allow us to identify regime shifts in functional relationships that are, e.g., triggered by extreme conditions. The challenges here include high-dimensionality, synergistic effects, and the often small sample size of observed impacts, and are relevant also in other fields such as neuroscience

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Causal evaluation of physical models</div>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many disciplines of Earth system sciences, models of the system or subsystem play a fundamental role in understanding relevant processes. Models differ regarding which subprocesses are resolved and the type of parametrization used. Biogeochemical models, for instance, help to understand element cycles and are a crucial basis for carbon-climate feedbacks in the coupled Earth system. At a higher level, climate models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
   </span> simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, water bodies, land surface and the cryosphere. In all cases, and at all levels, models are based partly on differential equations representing known processes and partly on semi-empirical relationships representing unknown processes or approximating known processes that cannot be resolved at the global scale due to numerical issues
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
   </span>. Due to the nonlinear nature of the system, small differences in parameterization can potentially lead to large deviations in overall model characteristics. A key task is to evaluate which model better simulates the real system. Currently, such evaluations are based on simple descriptive statistics like mean and variance, climatologies, and spectral properties of model output and observations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
   </span>. However, even though a particular model might well fit descriptive statistics of the observational data, for example, the global distribution of gross primary production (GPP) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>), the model might not well simulate the physical mechanisms affecting GPP, given that multiple model formulations and parameterizations, even when wrong, can fit the observations equally well, a problem known as underdetermination or equifinality
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
   </span>. As a complementary criterion we propose to compare reconstructed causal dependencies of models and observational data (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). The underlying premise is that causal dependencies are more directly linked to the physical processes and are, therefore, more robust against overfitting than simple statistics and, hence, models that are causally similar to observations will also yield more reliable future projections. As for the previous example, also here the challenges lie in extracting suitable causal variables from often noisy station-based measurements or high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields and also the fact that processes can interact nonlinearly involving different spatio-temporal scales. In addition, model output may not satisfy the conditions underlying some causal inference methods, e.g., if dependencies are purely deterministic. Finally, suitable evaluation and comparison statistics based on causal networks need to be defined (see paragraph on causal complex network analysis). In Earth system sciences, model evaluation can help to build more realistic models to improve projections of the future, which is highly relevant for policy making
