  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> was the first formalization of a practically quantifiable causality definition from time series. The original idea, based on work by Wiener
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, is to test whether omitting the past of a time series 
  <span class="italic">X</span> in a time series model including 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>’s own and other covariates’ past increases the prediction error of the next time step of 
  <span class="italic">Y</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The concept of GC can be implemented with different time series models. Classically, the Granger causality test is based on linear autoregressive modeling (see Box 
  <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">1</a>), but nonlinear dependencies can be modeled with more complex time series models or even the information-theoretic analog transfer entropy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. While bivariate time series models do not explicitly account for indirect links or common drivers as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, more variables can be included in multivariate extensions of GC. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Box 
  <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">1</a> GC is limited to lagged causal dependencies and, furthermore, has known deficiencies in the presence of subsampled time series and other issues
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. GC has a long history of applications across a wide range of scientific domains, including Earth system science

     <span class="bold">c</span> Causal network learning algorithms cope well with high dimensionality and can often also identify the direction of contemporaneous links. Exemplified on the model of Box 
     <a rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec8">1</a>, the PC algorithm
     <span class="sup">
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
     </span>, adapted to time series, starts from a graph where all unconditionally (
     <span class="italic">p</span> = 0) dependent variable pairs (assuming stationarity, only links ending at time 
     <span class="italic">t</span> are represented) are connected and iteratively tests conditional independence with increasing number of conditions 
     <span class="italic">p</span>. Lagged links are oriented forward in time (causes precede effects), while contemporaneous links are left undirected (circle marks at the ends) in this skeleton discovery phase. For example, 
     <span class="italic">X</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>−1
     </sub> and 
     <span class="italic">Z</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> (black nodes) are correctly identified as independent already in the second iteration step (
     <span class="italic">p</span> = 1) where the dependence through 
     <span class="italic">Y</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t-1</span>
     </sub> (blue box) is conditioned out, while we need to condition on two variables to detect that 
     <span class="italic">Z</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>−2
     </sub> and 
     <span class="italic">W</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> are independent (
     <span class="italic">p</span> = 2). In contrast to GC, PC avoids conditioning on the whole past leading to lower estimation dimensions. Contemporaneous links are then oriented by applying a set of rules in the orientation phase. Here the finding that 
     <span class="italic">W</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t-1</span>
     </sub> and 
     <span class="italic">Z</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> are independent conditional on 
     <span class="italic">Z</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>−1
     </sub>, but not conditional on 
     <span class="italic">W</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub>, allows to identify 
     <span class="italic">Z</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub>→
     <span class="italic">W</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> because the other causal direction is not consistent with the observed conditional independencies. However, for the link between 
     <span class="italic">X</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> and 
     <span class="italic">Y</span>
     <sub>
      <span class="italic">t</span>
     </sub> no such rule can be applied since all conditional-independence based algorithms resolve causal graphs only up to a Markov equivalence class.
