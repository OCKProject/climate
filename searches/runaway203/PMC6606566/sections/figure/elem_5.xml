  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Time series of the cloud fraction (triangles ∆) and sea ice extent (circles ○). Both cloud fraction and sea ice extent have been subjected to a linear detrending process. The cloud fraction is calculated from the sensitive zone over the period from August 1 to October 15. The sea ice extent is the north hemispheric average between the August 15 and September 15 when the minimum sea ice extents are included. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) The relation between the cloudy area of the melted Arctic Ocean and the melted area at the sensitive zone. 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis: the melted area in the sensitive zone in Mkm
   <span class="sup">2</span>. 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis: the surface area of the melted region covered by clouds. The std of the melted area that covered by cloudy has an average of 0.32 Mkn
   <span class="sup">2</span>. The uncertainties of the regression coefficients satisfy the significance of 95%. Linear de-trending has also been applied to the areas. Detrending is used to remove the linear fitting from the average cloud fractions or areas.
