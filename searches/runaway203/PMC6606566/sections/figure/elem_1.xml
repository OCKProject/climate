  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Map of Pearson correlation coefficient between the cloud and SIC anomalies. The white areas have insufficient samples to allow calculation. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) shows the significance of the correlation relation. The blue color means the relation is true at the 95% confidence level. The red color means the probability is less than 95% for the correlation to be true. Both (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">b</span>) are based on the sampling elements of the average of cloud anomaly and SIC anomaly for a 9-day period and in the 3° (latitude) by 8° (longitude) box.
