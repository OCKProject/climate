 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the surface changes during the melt period from snow-covered sea ice to partially snow- melt pond-covered sea ice to totally open water, the albedo of this heterogenous surface will decrease. Because the cloud albedo lies between the albedo of snow and the albedo of dark open water, an increase in cloud cover due to loss of sea ice coverage is expected to partly compensate for the associated albedo decrease and tend to restore the TOA albedo during the sea ice melt period to the pre-melt value. The planetary albedo is determined by reflection from both the surface and the atmosphere. Under clear sky conditions, the TOA albedo is primarily determined by the surface condition. The albedo anomalies, calculated by subtracting the areal average from 2007 to 2010, under clear sky conditions, shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>: 2007 and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>: 2008, have the same direction as that of the SIC anomalies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a,c</a>). For 2007, the East Siberian Sea and Kara Sea areas have a negative albedo anomaly (−10%), while the Beaufort Sea area has a slightly positive anomaly (+2%). For 2008, the TOA albedo has a positive anomaly (+10%) in the Kara Sea area and a negative anomaly (−8%) in the Beaufort Sea area. The distribution of the anomaly directions is consistent with the distribution of the SIC anomaly shown in Fig.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the TOA albedo anomaly for all sky conditions, shown in (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>: 2007 and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>: 2008), is much smoother than that of the clear sky. The TOA albedo anomaly is reduced to about ±4% for both 2007 and 2008. For 2007, the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea have a smaller SIC and also exhibit a negative anomaly of about −10% in the clear sky TOA albedo. When the effects of clouds are taken into account, the TOA albedo anomaly of all sky conditions in this area is reduced to −4%. The increase in cloud amount due to the sea ice retreat can recover the TOA albedo by about 6%. The same area (Laptev Sea) but for 2008, has a positive SIC anomaly and shows a TOA albedo anomaly of 12% under clear sky conditions. The presence of clouds reduce the TOA albedo anomaly to about 3%. Fewer clouds can restore the TOA albedo by about 9%.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under clear sky conditions, the TOA albedo is determined by the surface and the albedo anomalies are coincident with the anomaly of SIC. Under all sky conditions, the TOA albedo is determined by clouds and the surface. The modification of cloud cover in response to sea ice retreat will affect the TOA albedo anomaly.</p>
