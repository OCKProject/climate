 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the initial forcing due to the increase in greenhouse gases, through internal feedbacks the climate system adjusts itself to a new equilibrium state. The basic adjustment is higher Surface Air Temperature (SAT). Due to several feedback mechanisms, the SAT increase in the Arctic is 2–4 times larger than the global mean

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. This phenomenon, called the Arctic Amplification, has been confirmed by observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> as well as model simulations
  <span class="sup">

  </span>.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms responsible for the Arctic Amplification include: Albedo feedback due to changes in sea ice extent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports: transport of heat flux that warms the polar area
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave irradiance to the surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, soot on snow, increased black carbon aerosol concentrations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. A positive feedback acts to amplify the initial perturbation such as the increasing temperature resulting from extra emission of carbon dioxide, while a negative feedback tends to dampen it. The quantitative contributions of the feedbacks are still being debated. By applying the coupled feedback response analysis method, model assimilation results show that the albedo feedback is the major contributor to the Arctic Amplification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, while the cloud feedback is the second largest contributor
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. However, using the radiative kernel technique, Pithan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> showed that the dominant contributor is the temperature feedback (low latitude areas emit more longwave radiation to space than the polar areas for the same temperature increase because low latitude areas have a higher basic temperature), and that the albedo feedback is the second largest contributor. Model simulations indicate that the Arctic Amplification may still occur without the albedo feedback
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the increase in SAT over the last several decades the sea ice extent in the Arctic has retreated significantly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The minimum sea ice extent, in September, has a trend of −11.4% per decade from 1979 to 2007 and the decline is accelerating
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. The sea ice has been retreating the fastest in the Kara Sea, Barents Sea, and Beaufort Sea regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. As the sea ice melts and ponds form, the albedo decreases greatly. The darker water surface absorbs more solar energy than the sea ice or snow covered surface. The extra absorbed energy will enhance the sea ice melt. This process is well known as the albedo feedback, which is a positive feedback mechanism contributing to the Arctic Amplification. Based on the radiative kernel technique
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, a quantitative assessment of the albedo feedback’s contribution to the amplification is provided by the model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. However, observational assessment of and constraint to the albedo feedback are still lacking.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate system continually adjusts itself to the change in sea ice extent. The sea ice layer acts as a thermal and water vapor insulator between the atmosphere and the underlying water. As the ice layer becomes thinner and ponds grow, the exchange of water vapor and heat between the air and ocean increases. On the other hand, the water vapor evaporation will increase as the SAT increases if we assume fixed relative humidity over the open water. Reduction in sea ice will lead to increased heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. A loss in sea ice extent of 0.1 Mkm
  <span class="sup">2</span> is estimated to result in a 10–20% increase in moisture content in the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Arctic regions with more sea ice are found to have a smaller cloud fraction and a smaller cloud liquid water content
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. On average, clouds cool the Arctic from February to November through the shortwave forcing and warm the Arctic all year around through the longwave radiative forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Detailed radiative effects in polar areas are complex and may vary from negative to positive due to the high frequency of temperature inversions. The response of clouds to sea ice retreat may have significant impacts on the radiative energy balance in polar regions. Because of the comparable albedo of sea ice and cloud, a change in cloud cover in response to an increase in open water during the melt period may significantly affect the radiative energy balance by adjusting the albedo feedback process.

  <span class="italic">δT</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub>) to the climate system, the system tends to adjust itself through a variety of feedback processes. For example, the net TOA flux (

   </div>
  </div>) is determined by the water vapor abundance, temperature, cloud properties, surface albedo and so on for a given place and time. The initial perturbation may induce changes in all of the feedback parameters. The total perturbation in the TOA flux can be expressed as a summation of partial radiative perturbations from each feedback parameter. A feedback parameter for each variable 
  <span class="italic">X</span> can be expressed as the radiative kernel and climate response pattern
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The radiative kernel is the ratio of TOA flux perturbation and the change in the feedback parameter such as the anomaly of sea ice concentration (SIC for short). The radiative kernel can be used to assess climate feedbacks consistently across models. For example, the contributions from a variety of feedbacks to the Arctic Amplification were examined by comparing radiative kernels consistent results produced by climate models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. However, radiative kernels are generally obtained from model simulations. The anomalies of SIC and radiative forcing at TOA provide us with an opportunity to calculate the radiative kernel from observations obtained by space-based sensors.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to sea ice (with partial snow cover), the Arctic Ocean has an albedo of about 0.65
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. In stark contrast, a liquid water surface is quite dark with an albedo of about 0.1
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Hence, during the period of sea ice melt, the albedo changes from 0.65 to a value approaching 0.1 implying that the surface will absorb more solar energy. The extra energy further enhances the SAT and accelerates the sea ice melt. However, the albedo of clouds is slightly smaller than but comparable to the albedo of sea ice. The planetary (TOA) albedo is due to reflection from both the surface and the atmosphere. On a global scale, the atmospheric reflection contributes about 88% of the planetary albedo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. In the Arctic, the response of clouds to the change in sea ice extent, snow cover, and melt pond fraction will impact the TOA albedo, and hence the final contribution of the albedo feedback to the Arctic Amplification.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both sea ice and clouds play essential roles in the climate system, and their longterm variations are the primary indicators of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. The climate effects of sea ice and clouds have been intensively studied for several decades. Recent studies confirmed that the sea ice retreat has had a significant impact on the Arctic cloud cover. Arctic clouds can be influenced by the large scale atmospheric circulation, near surface stability and surface conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. The cloud properties differ significantly between meteorological regimes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Synoptic regimes, such as the warm advection, cold advection, can impact clouds at different heights and influence the date of sea ice melt onset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clouds and sea ice have a significant covariance under stable conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Liquid clouds respond to the sea ice variability except during summer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Results obtained from passive sensors show that low clouds can form over newly formed open water during early fall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Based on simulations, Abe 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> found that the cloud fraction increased with the retreat of sea ice and that the increase in cloud cover would enhance the longwave warming. The minimum sea ice extent in 2012 was followed by a decrease in cloud cover in winter
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, which may have led to a cooling of the surface and an increase in sea ice extent the following year. Hence, changes in cloudiness can potentially influence the sea ice extent

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we investigate the response of summer and early fall cloud cover to changes in sea ice extent and its impact on the shortwave and longwave radiation budget. Due to frequent temperature inversions and small temperature contrast between the surface and cloud in the Arctic, passive sensors have limited ability to detect clouds in the polar regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. By applying active sensors, combined CALIPSO and CloudSat observations can overcome the shortcomings of cloud products provided by passive observations in the polar regions. To this end CALIPSO and CloudSat measurements are used to study the cloud-sea ice-climate feedback: the feedback due to sea ice retreat and the response of clouds to the sea ice retreat.
