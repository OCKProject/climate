 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies already show that a warmer Arctic is cloudier and that the corresponding cloud forcing changes from warming the surface to cooling the surface in different seasons

  </span>. The interactions between the clouds and the surface are complex and play an important role in the Arctic energy balance. This study presents the local character of the damping effect by the clouds in the Arctic climate system. The albedo feedback is one of the most pronounced positive feedback in the polar regions. Clouds can damp this positive feedback: cloud formation can partly compensate for the change in albedo due to the melting of sea ice. The damping mechanism works in two ways. The first one is the high coverage over the melted area. The second is cloud formation as the enhanced evaporation after sea ice melt. Several positive feedbacks such as albedo feedback, temperature feedback, water vapour feedback and so on work in parallel to amplify the SAT increase in the Arctic. The rise in SAT will enhance sea ice melt and reduce the surface albedo. However, the clouds can partly remedy the reduction in albedo which is due to those positive feedbacks.

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, the cloud anomalies reveal a regional response to the SIC anomalies. The cloud anomaly and SIC anomaly show a significant negative correlation in the Beaufort Sea and the East Siberian Sea. The correlation between the cloud anomaly and the SIC anomaly is non-uniformly distributed across the Arctic Ocean with a variation from positive to negative. The covariance of cloud and sea ice is locally significant but with nonuniform distribution. The two anomalies are not necessarily in the same location. For example, the SIC has a negative anomaly at a portion of the West Siberian Sea, where the cloud fraction also shows a negative anomaly for the year 2007. For 2007, the Beaufort Sea area has a slight increase in sea ice extent, but extremely low cloud fraction. The final TOA albedo anomaly is slightly negative.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed radiative forcing and SIC anomalies can be used to quantify the radiative kernel. These kernels represent the mean situation for SIC anomalies in range of 0.08 to 0.20. The radiative kernel represents a quantitative assessment of the feedback. A positive longwave radiative kernel means that sea ice loss will reduce upward longwave radiation through extra cloud formation stimulated by the sea ice loss. A positive longwave radiative kernel directly confirms the response of clouds to sea ice retreat.</p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cloud fraction shows a likely response to the variation in sea ice extent, but with outliers on a decadal time scale. The fluctuation of the average cloud fraction is within the uncertainty of the cloud fraction

  </span> observed by the CALIPSO lidar. The sensitive zone experiences a loop of melt and freeze-up. The sea ice extent has significant change during the period from August to October. The average cloud fraction of the sensitive zone is negatively related to the sea ice extent. This result indicates that the melting sea ice can result in an increase in the cloud amount. The fluctuation in SIC during the decade from 2006 to 2015 is 21% in the sensitive zone over the period from August to October. Because of the opposite anomaly directions at different geographic zones, the average cloud fractions of the sensitive zone only have fluctuation of about 2% but with huge uncertainty. The melted area has a constant cloud coverage of (81 ± 5)%. The albedo feedback is typically explained as the tremendous change in albedo occurring when the surface changes from snow or sea ice to open water. However, the dark melted (open water) areas are frequently covered by clouds. A cloud fraction of 81% over the melted areas can reduce the sea-ice/snow albedo feedback. We can conclude that: the high cloud coverage over the melted water dominates the albedo change in the albedo feedback process. On average, the extra cloud cover stimulated by sea ice loss is of second-order contribution.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies were aimed at revealing the interactions of cloud cover, sea ice concentration, radiative heating and weather conditions. Weak but significant covariance between cloud cover and sea ice exists in different atmospheric regimes

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new insights provided in this paper include the response of clouds to the melting sea ice revealing that the cloud coverage over the melted area remains a constant of about 81%. The polar area has components of a melted portion, frozen portion and a portion in melting or freezing. Melting or freezing areas with SIC values in the range from 1 to 0.85 may have different cloud coverage. The average cloud fractions over the sensitive zone are about 82% to 85%, which are slightly higher than the cloud fraction over the melted area. The open surface area is expected to have more clouds than the freezing up area. Most probably, melting or freezing areas have the highest cloud coverage. For the melted area in the sensitive zone, it is evident that the melted area has a cloud fraction of 81%. This huge cloud coverage over the melted or melting dark water surface can also moderate the effects of albedo feedback. Both the large cloud fraction and the response of clouds to the melting of sea ice can contribute to the smaller TOA albedo change relative to the clear sky.</p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new findings give the areal distribution of the cloud response to variation in SIC. The covariance between cloud cover and sea ice is evident and statistically significant in portions of the Arctic. Based on the change of sea ice and clouds, we provided an observational radiative kernel of sea ice albedo feedback for the first time. These new findings may also improve our ability to correctly capture feedbacks in climate models and lead to more accurate simulations of climate in the Arctic, and its impact on the global climate affecting agriculture productivity
