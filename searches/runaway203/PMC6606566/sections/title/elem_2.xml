   </span>. Several factors contribute to the variation in SIC and their impact depends on location. Focusing on the sea ice coverage, the Arctic can be divided into 3 different sections: the open water section, the permanent ice covered section, and the transitional section. Due to oceanic heat transport in the Atlantic section of the Arctic, the Greenland Sea, the Fram Strait, the Barents Sea, and the Kara Sea are open most of the year. The open water section is defined by the area with average SIC less than 20%. Surrounded by the continents and islands, the relatively closed portion of the Arctic Ocean (which includes the Lincoln Sea, the outer part of the Canadian Archipelago, and part of the Beaufort Sea) has average SIC greater than 90%. The section with average SIC greater than 90% is called “permanent ice covered” section. The transitional section of the Arctic Ocean has SIC varying from 20% to 90% with distinct seasonal variation, and it also exhibits significant inter-annual variations. These SIC variations have a considerable impact on the cloud coverage.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean SIC in the melt season, taken to be from July 1 to September 15 in this paper, is used to represent the sea ice coverage for a given year. Focusing on the anomaly of the mean SIC, calculated by subtracting the areal average from 2006 to 2015, we find that the mean SIC departs from the average, and that the anomalies show regional and inter-annual variations. The SIC anomalies of 2006 and 20015 are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (second and fourth columns). The corresponding anomalies of the cloud fraction are shown in the first and third columns in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The regional distributions of the cloud anomaly are closely related to those of the sea ice anomaly. The reduced sea ice coverage may enhance the evaporation implying that an increase in cloud coverage is expected to be observed

   </span>. The covariance of the sea ice anomaly and the cloud anomaly confirms the response of cloud cover to the change in sea ice. Based on 10-year observations, the covariance has different patterns. The directions of the cloud anomaly are mostly opposite to those of the sea ice anomalies for most years and regions. For example: the Beaufort Sea area, which has a strong positive sea ice anomaly, shows a negative cloud anomaly in 2006. The contrasting cloud and ice anomalies are distinctly regionally dependent in 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2014. Only part of the transitional section shows opposite cloud and sea ice anomalies in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015. Areas that have negative sea ice anomalies do not always have positive cloud anomalies and vice versa. For example, both the cloud and sea ice have positive anomalies in the East Siberian Sea area in 2009 and 2010, where the cloud and sea ice anomalies are negative in the Laptev Sea area in 2011 and around the Sevemaya Zemlya area in 2012.

The region of negative correlation is more significant than the positive area. The nonuniform regional covariance reveals that the response maybe influenced by other factors such as atmospheric circulation. The significant but nonuniform response of clouds to the sea ice retreat may influence the albedo feedback. The time lag between cloud formation and the enhancement of evaporation is considered in the investigated periods of sea ice and cloud correlation. The sea ice anomaly is based on the average over the melt period from July 1 to September 15. The cloud anomaly is based on the average over the period from August 15 to October 15 which is later than that of the sea ice.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the surface changes during the melt period from snow-covered sea ice to partially snow- melt pond-covered sea ice to totally open water, the albedo of this heterogenous surface will decrease. Because the cloud albedo lies between the albedo of snow and the albedo of dark open water, an increase in cloud cover due to loss of sea ice coverage is expected to partly compensate for the associated albedo decrease and tend to restore the TOA albedo during the sea ice melt period to the pre-melt value. The planetary albedo is determined by reflection from both the surface and the atmosphere. Under clear sky conditions, the TOA albedo is primarily determined by the surface condition. The albedo anomalies, calculated by subtracting the areal average from 2007 to 2010, under clear sky conditions, shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>: 2007 and Fig.

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a,c</a>). For 2007, the East Siberian Sea and Kara Sea areas have a negative albedo anomaly (−10%), while the Beaufort Sea area has a slightly positive anomaly (+2%). For 2008, the TOA albedo has a positive anomaly (+10%) in the Kara Sea area and a negative anomaly (−8%) in the Beaufort Sea area. The distribution of the anomaly directions is consistent with the distribution of the SIC anomaly shown in Fig.

For 2007, the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea have a smaller SIC and also exhibit a negative anomaly of about −10% in the clear sky TOA albedo. When the effects of clouds are taken into account, the TOA albedo anomaly of all sky conditions in this area is reduced to −4%. The increase in cloud amount due to the sea ice retreat can recover the TOA albedo by about 6%. The same area (Laptev Sea) but for 2008, has a positive SIC anomaly and shows a TOA albedo anomaly of 12% under clear sky conditions. The presence of clouds reduce the TOA albedo anomaly to about 3%. Fewer clouds can restore the TOA albedo by about 9%.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clouds primarily scatter (and reflect) shortwave radiation and primarily absorb longwave (terrestrial) radiation. Clouds re-emit the absorbed radiation at the effective cloud temperature, which (except for temperature inversions) is usually lower than the surface temperature. The cloud is negatively related to the SIC at part of the Arctic area. When sea ice retreats, more clouds are expected to form and have radiative effects: (i) increase the solar energy reflected to space and thereby cool the atmosphere (surface), and (ii) reduce the outgoing longwave radiation which warms the surface. The net radiative effect of clouds may change from warming to cooling due to frequent temperature inversions and low solar elevations in the polar regions.</p>

The statistical relation of the melted area and the melted area that is covered by clouds is shown in the right panel (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) of the Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>. About (81 ± 5)% of the melted area in the sensitive zone is covered by clouds. The essential of the albedo feedback is the wane of albedo when the surface type change from sea ice to the darker water. From the CALIPSO observation, about 81% of the melted area is covered by clouds. The uncertainty of the melted area is 0.32 Mkm
   <span class="sup">2</span> which equals to the uncertainty of 15% in the cloud fraction. The high coverage over the melted dark water can compensate about 81% of the albedo-feedback in the Arctic Ocean area.

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the process of sea ice melt, the clouds fraction maintains a constant value of 81% over the melted ocean. This phenomenon may indicate that high cloud coverage over the melted ocean dominates the impact of cloud cover on the albedo feedback. The increase in the cloud fraction in the entire sensitive zone is not significant as a function of the sea ice extent. The response to sea ice is only a second order contribution to moderate the change in albedo due to sea ice melt.</p>
