  </span>. Several factors contribute to the variation in SIC and their impact depends on location. Focusing on the sea ice coverage, the Arctic can be divided into 3 different sections: the open water section, the permanent ice covered section, and the transitional section. Due to oceanic heat transport in the Atlantic section of the Arctic, the Greenland Sea, the Fram Strait, the Barents Sea, and the Kara Sea are open most of the year. The open water section is defined by the area with average SIC less than 20%. Surrounded by the continents and islands, the relatively closed portion of the Arctic Ocean (which includes the Lincoln Sea, the outer part of the Canadian Archipelago, and part of the Beaufort Sea) has average SIC greater than 90%. The section with average SIC greater than 90% is called “permanent ice covered” section. The transitional section of the Arctic Ocean has SIC varying from 20% to 90% with distinct seasonal variation, and it also exhibits significant inter-annual variations. These SIC variations have a considerable impact on the cloud coverage.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean SIC in the melt season, taken to be from July 1 to September 15 in this paper, is used to represent the sea ice coverage for a given year. Focusing on the anomaly of the mean SIC, calculated by subtracting the areal average from 2006 to 2015, we find that the mean SIC departs from the average, and that the anomalies show regional and inter-annual variations. The SIC anomalies of 2006 and 20015 are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (second and fourth columns). The corresponding anomalies of the cloud fraction are shown in the first and third columns in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The regional distributions of the cloud anomaly are closely related to those of the sea ice anomaly. The reduced sea ice coverage may enhance the evaporation implying that an increase in cloud coverage is expected to be observed

  </span>. The covariance of the sea ice anomaly and the cloud anomaly confirms the response of cloud cover to the change in sea ice. Based on 10-year observations, the covariance has different patterns. The directions of the cloud anomaly are mostly opposite to those of the sea ice anomalies for most years and regions. For example: the Beaufort Sea area, which has a strong positive sea ice anomaly, shows a negative cloud anomaly in 2006. The contrasting cloud and ice anomalies are distinctly regionally dependent in 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2014. Only part of the transitional section shows opposite cloud and sea ice anomalies in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015. Areas that have negative sea ice anomalies do not always have positive cloud anomalies and vice versa. For example, both the cloud and sea ice have positive anomalies in the East Siberian Sea area in 2009 and 2010, where the cloud and sea ice anomalies are negative in the Laptev Sea area in 2011 and around the Sevemaya Zemlya area in 2012.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On average, the uncertainty of the cloud fraction is 5% at the 95% confidence level in absolute units. In seven of ten years, the maxima of the cloud anomaly can exceed the uncertainty. However, the cloud anomalies in 2009, 2011, and 2014 are not significant as their values are smaller or comparable to the uncertainty. The cloud anomalies are heterogeneous even over a large portion of the ice anomaly area. In 2012, the ice anomaly is negative from the Beaufort Sea to the Laptev Sea area where the cloud anomaly is positive but with some negative spots.</p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the ten years of observations, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the correlation significance are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> (subfigure 
  <span class="bold">a</span> for the correlation and 
  <span class="bold">b</span> for the significance). About 40% of the area does not show significance in the correlation. The correlation coefficients are within the range between −0.4 and 0.4. Most of the area shows negative correlation, which means that cloud cover increases as the sea ice retreats. A part of the Arctic Ocean shows a positive correlation. The significant negative area includes the East Siberian Sea and the Beaufort Sea. The most significant positive area is the Kara Sea.

  </span> once again. The correlation coefficients between the sea ice anomaly and cloud anomaly are negative in most areas but positive in some areas. The region of negative correlation is more significant than the positive area. The nonuniform regional covariance reveals that the response maybe influenced by other factors such as atmospheric circulation. The significant but nonuniform response of clouds to the sea ice retreat may influence the albedo feedback. The time lag between cloud formation and the enhancement of evaporation is considered in the investigated periods of sea ice and cloud correlation. The sea ice anomaly is based on the average over the melt period from July 1 to September 15. The cloud anomaly is based on the average over the period from August 15 to October 15 which is later than that of the sea ice.
