 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether climate warming would stimulate additional carbon release from terrestrial ecosystems to accelerate climate change (i.e., the carbon-climate feedback) is among the most uncertain processes for predicting future climate warming. The majority of modeling studies suggests that feedback of terrestrial carbon cycle to climate warming is positive, as models simulate a stronger warming stimulation of respiration than photosynthesis (

   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). In contrast, results from experimental studies show that warming stimulates either net carbon release or uptake in terrestrial ecosystems, leading to positive (

  </a>–

  </a>) climate-carbon feedbacks across different ecosystems (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), respectively. The mechanisms governing the observed variable feedbacks have not been well understood nor represented in models. Among many candidate mechanisms, soil water content (SWC) has been shown to ubiquitously regulate responses of the carbon cycle to warming in most experiments (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). While a recent study in a boreal forest has showed that the effects of climate warming on plant photosynthesis flipped from positive during wet to negative during dry periods of the growing season (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>), it is not clear whether such a flipping pattern of warming effects tipped by water conditions is generalizable to other carbon processes or even across ecosystem types.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is generally known that ecosystem carbon processes, such as net ecosystem productivity (NEP) or soil respiration, elevate with SWC in dry environment, reach its maximum at the optimal condition, and then depress in water-logged environment (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). Accordingly, we hypothesize that warming-induced decrease in SWC alleviates the depressing effects of water on NEP under wet conditions but aggravates drought effects under dry conditions. This indirect effect of warming through changes in SWC superimposes with direct warming effects on NEP to determine magnitudes and directions of carbon-climate feedback (

   <div class="title">Conceptual diagram of warming effects on ecosystem C fluxes above and below the SWC optimum.</div>
   <p>The red arrows represent the directly positive warming effect on ecosystem C fluxes. The black arrows represent the effect of warming-induced changes in SWC on C fluxes, which is the indirect effect of warming. Below the SWC optimum, the warming-induced decrease in SWC reduces C fluxes; thus, the black arrow points downward along the SWC-C flux response curve. Above the SWC threshold, warming-induced water loss increases C fluxes; thus, the indirect warming effect enhances C fluxes, and the black arrow points upward along the SWC-C flux response curve. The blue dashed arrows represent the final change direction of C fluxes under the combination of both direct and indirect effects of warming.
