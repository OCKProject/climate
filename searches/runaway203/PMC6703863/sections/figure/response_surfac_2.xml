  <div class="title">Response surfaces showing the relationships between ST and SWC versus ecosystem C fluxes (i.e., GEP, ER, and NEP) across plots and years.</div>
  <p>Observed values (bubbles) are the means of each measurement of GEP, ER, and NEP. Modeled values (colored response surfaces with contour lines) are predictions from the models fitted with observations. The red arrows represent the effects of increasing temperature, and the black arrows indicate those of warming-induced decrease in SWC. The blue dashed arrows represent the potential changes of ecosystem C fluxes in combination of the two driving forces of changing ST and SWC.</p>
