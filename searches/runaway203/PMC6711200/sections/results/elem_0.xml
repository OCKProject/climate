  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating the climate effects of an emission pulse of CH
   <sub>4</sub>
  </div>
  <p id="P18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis starts by calculating the climate effects of an emission pulse of CH
   <sub>4</sub>. We introduce an emission pulse of 28.3MT in 2011 (yielding a 10 ppb increase in CH
   <sub>4</sub> concentration in the initial year) applied on top of the GHG concentrations of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 (
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">Myhre et al., 2013</a>). 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> shows the changes in radiative forcing (RF; a), temperature (
   <span class="italic">T</span>; b), damages (c), and damages discounted at a 3% rate (d) out to the year 2300 resulting from such a pulse. 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> relies on calculations that use central estimates of the uncertain parameters, as discussed in the 
   <a rid="S2" ref-type="sec" href="#S2">Methods</a> section. While the graph is truncated at 2300, the calculations used in this paper extend to 2500. The impacts of an emission pulse of CO
   <sub>2</sub> are also shown using 24.8 times the mass of the CH
   <sub>4</sub> pulse (this factor is chosen to create equivalent integrated damages over the full time period when discounted at 3% as shown in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1d</a>). 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1a</a> and 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">b</a> demonstrate the trade-offs between near-term and long-term impacts when assigning equivalency to emission pulses of different lifetimes. After 100 years, the radiative forcing effects of the CH
   <sub>4</sub> pulse decay to 0.04% of the initial forcing in the year of the emission pulse, and the temperature effects decay to 4% of the peak temperature (reached 10 years after the pulse). In contrast, after 100 years the radiative forcing effects of the CO
   <sub>2</sub> pulse decay to 22% of the initial forcing, and the temperature effects decay to 51% of the CO
   <sub>2</sub> peak temperature (reached 18 years after the pulse). The immediacy of the temperature effects for the CH
   <sub>4</sub> pulse creates larger damages in both overall and discounted dollar terms for the first 42 years. After 43 years, the sustained CO
   <sub>2</sub> effects overtake the CH
   <sub>4</sub> effects. With a different discount rate, a different factor would have been used to calculate the CO
   <sub>2</sub> mass used for the CO
   <sub>2</sub> pulse, which would change the crossing point for damages – a higher discount rate would require a larger CO
   <sub>2</sub> equivalent pulse relative to the CH
   <sub>4</sub> pulse and therefore an earlier crossing point (and vice versa). 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1c</a> demonstrates the dramatic increase in damage over time due to the relationship of damage to economic growth. In the case of CH
   <sub>4</sub>, damage peaks in 2032 and declines until 2080 as a result of the short lifetime of the gas. The increase in damages after 2080 is due to the component of the temperature response function that includes a 409-year timescale decay rate such that after 100 years the decrease in the Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> component of the damage equation is about 0.5% year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, and because that decay rate is slower than the rate of GDP growth, net damages grow. 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1d</a> demonstrates the dramatic decrease in future damages when applying a constant discount rate. Taken as a whole, these four figures demonstrate the trade-offs required when attempting to create equivalences for emissions of gases with very different lifetimes.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implying a discount rate</div>
  <p id="P19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis of evaluating the radiative forcing, temperature, damages, and discounted damages of a pulse emission can be used to calculate the consistent GWP timescale for a given discount rate or, conversely, the discount rates that are consistent with a given GWP timescale by comparing the net present discounted marginal damages of CH
   <sub>4</sub> to CO
   <sub>2</sub>. 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> shows the relationship between the discount rate and the GWP timescale. Here we focus on what discount rates are consistent with a GWP time horizon in order to show the discount rates implied by common choices of GWP timescales. The converse calculation is relevant for an audience that has a preferred discount rate and is interested in the implied GWP timescale.
  </p>
  <p id="P20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, the discount rate implied by the GWP100 is 3.3% (interquartile range of 2.7% to 4.1 %). The discount rate implied by a 20-year GWP timescale is 12.6% (interquartile range of 11.1% to 14.6 %). The results in the figure are truncated to the year 2300 and the calculation is truncated to the year 2500, which may matter at very low discount rates due to the long lifetime of CO
   <sub>2</sub>. At a 3% discount rate, 90% of the discounted CO
   <sub>2</sub> damages from an emissions pulse comes in the first 157 years and 95% in 189 years. For CH
   <sub>4</sub>, the equivalent of 90 and 95% is 87 and 123 years, with the long tail on temperature effects causing elongated damages beyond the lifetime of the gas itself. Even at a 2% discount rate, 95% of the CO
   <sub>2</sub> damages come in the first 287 years. At discount rates lower than 2 %, however, truncation effects can account for errors in damage ratio estimates of greater than a percent, indicating that longer calculation timeframes may be necessary to capture the full effect of the emissions pulse.
  </p>
  <p id="P21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is much discussion regarding which discount rates are most appropriate for use in evaluating climate damages. Since 2003, the US government has used discount rates of 3% and 7% to evaluate regulatory actions, and 3% was deemed appropriate for regulation that “primarily and directly affects private consumption” and 7% for regulations that “alter the use of capital in the private sector” (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">OMB, 2003</a>). From the current analysis, a 3% discount rate is consistent with a GWP of 118 years (interquartile range of 84–171 years) and 7% with a GWP of 38 years (interquartile range of 32–47 years). The OMB Circular also recognizes that there are special ethical considerations when impacts may accrue to future generations, and climate change is a prime example of an impact for which discount rates lower than 3% could be justified. A number of researchers have advocated for time-dependent declining discount rates (
   <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">Weitzman, 2001</a>; 
   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">Newell and Pizer, 2003</a>; 
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">Gollier et al., 2008</a>). The UK and France both already use declining discount rates in policy-making, and in both cases, the certainty equivalent discount rate drops below 3% within 100 years and approaches 2% within 300 years (
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">Cropper et al., 2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="P22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper does not select a single “correct” discount rate. However, the analysis shows that the 100-year timescale is consistent, within the interquartile range, with the 3% discount rate that is commonly used for climate change analysis. In contrast, a 20-year time horizon for the GWP implies discount rates larger than those used in any climate change analysis publications to date.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity analyses</div>
  <p id="P23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> shows the median, interquartile, interdecile, and extremes of the equivalent GWP time horizon corresponding to a given discount rate from a sensitivity analysis. The uncertainty was calculated assuming equal likelihood of each of the 972 combinations of all of the parameter choices used in this paper: four RCPs, three climate sensitivities, three damage exponents, three forcing imbalance options, three temperature offsets, and three GDP growth rates. The ranges chosen for each parameter are described in the 
   <a rid="S2" ref-type="sec" href="#S2">Methods</a> section. The parameters with the largest effect on the uncertainty of the calculated GWP (at a discount rate of 3 %) are the rate of GDP growth and the damage exponent (see 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). For these six parameters, the choices that lead to larger damages from CH
   <sub>4</sub> relative to CO
   <sub>2</sub> are a low GDP growth, a low damage exponent, a low-emissions scenario, a higher temperature offset (e.g., assuming that damages are a function of warming from preindustrial, not warming from present day), a lower climate sensitivity, and a higher current forcing imbalance. The general trend is that the more that damages are expected to grow in the future (e.g., high GDP growth, damage exponent, or emissions scenario), the longer the equivalent timescale is for a given discount rate.
  </p>
  <p id="P24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While CO
   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> are the largest contributors to climate change (as evaluated by contributions of historical emissions to present-day radiative forcing as in Table 8.SM.6 in the IPCC and by the magnitude of present-day emissions as evaluated by the standard GWP100), it is also informative to evaluate emissions of other gases with these techniques. 
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a> shows five gases and their atmospheric lifetimes. For each gas, an “optimal” GWP timescale was calculated that would replicate the ratio of net present damage of that gas to CO
   <sub>2</sub> at a discount rate of 3 %. The ratio of the GWP100 and the GWP20 to that optimal damage ratio is also shown. For longer-lived gases (e.g., N
   <sub>2</sub>O and HFC-23), there is no integration time period that can produce a ratio as large as the calculated damage ratio at a discount rate of 3 %. For these gases, we list the timescale that yields the maximum possible ratio and note that the GWP for longer-lived gases is fairly insensitive to timescale (further comparisons of non-CO
   <sub>2</sub> gases are presented in the 
   <a rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#SD1">Supplement</a>). This table shows that at a discount rate of 3% and as evaluated using net present damage ratios, the use of a 100-year timescale is consistent (interquartile range) with the optimal timescale / damage ratios for methane. For gases with lifetimes in centuries, the GWP at any timescale undervalues these gases, but the magnitude of that undervaluation is somewhat insensitive to the choice of timescale. For the longest-lived gases, the GWP also undervalues reductions in these gases, but the longer the timescale the better the match.
  </p>
  <p id="P25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to investigating the sensitivity of these results to different choices of the six listed parameters and five different gases, several other sensitivity experiments were performed. These experiments were chosen to investigate whether certain assumptions are important and alternate approaches to constructing the model.</p>
  <p id="P26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first set of experiments involve analysis choices that end up having little difference in terms of timescale estimation. In general, this is because changes in these choices affect both the GWP and the damage estimation equally and therefore cancel out. One experiment involved changing the size of the emissions pulse to 373 MMT (about 1 year of anthropogenic emissions according to 
   <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">Saunois et al., 2016</a>). The effect on damage ratios of this change was less than 1 %. Another experiment involved doubling the radiative efficiency of methane; while this led to a doubling of the estimated damage ratio, it also led to a doubling of the estimated GWP such that the change in estimated timescale was about 1/10 of 1 %. This experiment confirms that timescale estimates are insensitive to updates to estimates of the radiative efficiency of individual gases (such as the finding of 
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">Etminan et al., 2016</a>, that methane has greater forcing effects than previously estimated). A third experiment arose because of the question of consistency between the treatment of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> in terms of climate–carbon feedbacks (
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Gasser et al., 2017</a>; 
   <a rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" href="#R58">Sterner and Johansson, 2017</a>). Using the CO
   <sub>2</sub> lifetime from 
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Gasser et al. (2017)</a> without climate–carbon feedbacks, an increase in damage ratios of about 8% was estimated, but a similar increase in GWP of about 7% was estimated, with a net effect on timescales of less than 1 %. The converse experiment (including climate-carbon feedbacks in both the CO
   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> lifetimes) was not analyzed due to the increased complexity of the calculation. However, given that the virtue of the GWP is its simplicity, the authors suggest that the use of lifetimes without climate–carbon feedbacks for either gas should be preferred over the inclusion of those feedbacks in the lifetimes of both gases (
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">Sarofim, 2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="P27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another experiment considered the use of a Ramseytype framework for discounting future damages. The use of such a framework has been recommended by the National Academies (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">NAS, 2017</a>). In this framework, discount rates are a function of the marginal utility of consumption, the pure rate of time preference, and the future growth rate of per capita consumption. It is the latter dependence that makes this sensitivity analysis particularly interesting, as this pairs higher consumption growth (leading to higher damage ratios) with higher discount rates (leading to lower damage ratios). For this experiment, the Ramsey parameters were calibrated to yield an average discount rate for the reference GDP of 5% over the first 30 years of the analysis given a pure rate of time preference of 0.01 %. Under this assumption, the median timescale under the reference GDP scenario increases to 135 years because even though the initial discount rates are higher than 3 %, over the entire period of the analysis the average discount rate is only 1.5 %. However, unlike in the original analysis, under the high GDP growth scenario the damage ratio increases and the equivalent timescale decreases to 90 years because the increase in discount rate resulting from high growth has a larger effect on damages than the long-term increase in GDP (and vice versa for low GDP growth). The difference between the damage ratios for the high and low GDP growth scenarios is still about a factor of 2. A future analysis could pair GDP scenarios with emissions scenarios to take into account the potential correlation of the two.

  <p id="P28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">Boucher (2012)</a> and 
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al. (2003)</a> both applied similar approaches to the one used in this paper, but both papers identified a discount rate consistent with the GWP100 that was somewhat lower than the median 3.3% value found in this paper. The most evident difference between the approach in these previous papers and this article is that this article assumes that damages are expressed as a percent of GDP, and the previous analyses did not. In order to more closely emulate the Boucher and Fuglestvedt approach, the model was tested by using constant GDP over the entire time period, and the GWP100 was found to be the most consistent with a discount rate of 1.2% (interquartile range of 1.0% to 1.9 %) in contrast to 3.3% (interquartile range of 2.7% to 4.1 %).
  </p>
  <p id="P29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">Myhre et al. (2013)</a> justified the exclusion of the 500-year GWP based on the large uncertainties and ambiguities involved with far future projections. This analysis extends through 2500 and therefore might be subject to some of those same uncertainties. Therefore, the effect of two shorter time periods was investigated. When truncating the analysis after 150 years, the GWP100 was still found to be consistent with a discount rate of 3.3 %, with the upper interquartile bound also remaining constant at 4.1 %, though the lower end of the interquartile range decreased modestly to 2.4 %. When the analysis was truncated at 100 years into the future, the implicit discount rates dropped more substantially, to 2.6% (interquartile range of 1.5% to 3.5 %). Truncating the analysis will naturally make CH
   <sub>4</sub> mitigation appear more favorable relative to CO
   <sub>2</sub>, but even discount rates as small as 3% are sufficient to make effects more than 150 years into the future inconsequential to the results.
  </p>
  <p id="P30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final experiment considered the inclusion of damages due to rate of change and due to absolute temperature. The inclusion of rate-of-change damages has had important influences on previous analyses. For example, in 
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">Manne and Richels (2001)</a>, the dynamic optimization solution for approaching a temperature threshold placed little value on CH
   <sub>4</sub> reduction relative to CO
   <sub>2</sub> until a couple decades before the threshold was reached; but when a rate-of-change requirement was added, the relative value of CH
   <sub>4</sub> reduction stayed fairly constant over the time period. The challenge for this analysis is in determining the appropriate damage form, as the literature for estimating damages due to rate of change is not as robust as for absolute changes. As a test case, the peak rate-of-change damages under the median parameter values were calibrated to be equal to the absolute damages in the year 2060 (50 years into the analysis). The effect of the inclusion of this effect was to increase the damage ratio of CH
   <sub>4</sub> to CO
   <sub>2</sub> by 2.4 %. This fairly modest impact is consistent with the results of 
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">Bowerman et al. (2013)</a> and 
   <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">Rogelj et al. (2015)</a>, which suggest that near-term mitigation of SLCFs has modest effects on reducing the peak rate of change for higher future emissions scenarios and that delayed SLCF mitigation may yield most of the same benefits as immediate SLCF mitigation in terms of both peak absolute change and rate of change. In order examine how this effect could be sensitive to a lower emissions scenario, the analysis was repeated for the RCP3PD scenario by itself. Under this assumption, the damage ratio increases by 53 %, resulting in a decrease in the optimal timescale for RCP3PD associated with a discount rate of 3% from 94 to 54 years. This result is also consistent with Bowerman et al., who found more benefit in reducing near-term SLCF emissions if future emissions are expected to be low.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional uncertainties</div>
  <p id="P31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of uncertainties involved in this analysis. They can be divided into three categories: those that may change the relative climate-related discounted damages of CH
   <sub>4</sub> compared to CO
   <sub>2</sub> but have minimal effect on the implied timescale of the GWP, those that have a large impact on the implied timescale, and those effects of CH
   <sub>4</sub> and CO
   <sub>2</sub> that are unrelated to their climate forcing.
  </p>
  <p id="P32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown above, uncertainties in this analysis that do not have a large impact on the calculated GWP timescale include factors that have similar effects on the GWP and the CH
   <sub>4</sub> : CO
   <sub>2</sub> discounted damage ratio, such as radiative efficiency and consistent treatment of climate–carbon feedbacks.
  </p>
  <p id="P33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the timescale of ocean heat uptake, the lag between the timing of atmospheric temperature response to forcing and the response of sea level (e.g., 
   <a rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" href="#R68">Zickfeld et al., 2017</a>), and other issues that are inherent to the timing of climate impacts – but are not necessarily included in the GWP calculation – might all affect the implied timescale. One potential way to explore some of these effects would be to use a more complex climate model to evaluate the radiative forcing and temperature effects of the emission pulses. The shape of the damage function can also have a substantial effect; different exponents for the polynomial form were tested, as was the inclusion of rate of change, but the full range of possible damage functions is substantially larger, including multi-polynomial behavior (
   <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">Weitzman, 2001</a>) and the potential for persistent influences on economic growth (
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">Burke et al., 2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="P34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional category of effects has less relevance to an analysis of an appropriate timescale for climate impacts, but would be important for overall valuation. These are generally gas-specific effects that should most appropriately be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than folding into a timescale analysis that will influence the mitigation choices for all gases. One example is the inclusion of CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects, which would reduce the relative importance of decreasing CO
   <sub>2</sub> compared to other gases. Other examples include the health effects of O
   <sub>3</sub> produced by reaction of CH
   <sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere (
   <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">Shindell et al., 2015</a>; 
   <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">Sarofim et al., 2017</a>), CO
   <sub>2</sub> effects on ocean acidification, and the possible reduced efficacy of CH
   <sub>4</sub> compared to CO
   <sub>2</sub> (
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">Modak et al., 2018</a>). These effects can be important for making mitigation decisions but are outside of the scope of consideration for a study focusing on how to choose a time horizon for comparing climate impacts. As an example, if the solution to undervaluing CH
   <sub>4</sub> mitigation due to its O
   <sub>3</sub> effects is to reduce the appropriate timescale for GHG comparisons, an identical gas without O
   <sub>3</sub> chemistry implications would be similarly prioritized. One potential approach that could be explored might be to apply a multiplier to the GWP after calculation to take into account these non-climatic effects, much like the GWP of methane takes into account indirect effects on climate through the production of tropospheric O
   <sub>3</sub> and stratospheric H
   <sub>2</sub>O by the use of a multiplicative factor.

  <p id="P35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis presented here suggests that the use of a 100-year time horizon for the GWP is in good agreement with what many consider an appropriate discount rate; however, we offer several caveats. Most importantly, this analysis makes the assumption that the net present damage of CH
   <sub>4</sub> and CO
   <sub>2</sub> is the best metric for evaluating the relative impact of gases. When analyzing several different common metrics, 
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">Azar and Johansson (2012)</a> asked whether society would prefer integrated metrics such as the GWP, single time period metrics such as the GTP, or economic metrics such as the global damage potential, which is parallel to the metric given primary weight in this paper. Considering the applications of a metric within the context of an integrated assessment model could enable the analysis of more complex economic interactions. Alternatively, a decision-making framework might consider factors other than damages; for example, in a multistage decision-making process under uncertainty, it might be possible that long-lived gas mitigation should be prioritized in order to increase future option value. Or there might be reasons to prioritize mitigation options that apply to capital stocks with long lifetimes or to decisions that involve path dependence, as those decisions would be more costly to reverse in the future.
  </p>
  <p id="P36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This metric approach is also not designed to achieve a long-term temperature goal such as stabilization at 2 °C above preindustrial temperatures. We note that no metric designed to trade off emission pulses is consistent with stabilization. One solution to this dilemma is the GWP* introduced by 
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">Allen et al. (2016)</a>, which creates an equivalence between an emission pulse of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and a constant stream of CH
   <sub>4</sub>. This analysis only looks at a pulse of emissions in 2011 and does not examine whether the equivalent timescale might change over time.
