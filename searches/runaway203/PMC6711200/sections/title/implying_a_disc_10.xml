 <p id="P19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis of evaluating the radiative forcing, temperature, damages, and discounted damages of a pulse emission can be used to calculate the consistent GWP timescale for a given discount rate or, conversely, the discount rates that are consistent with a given GWP timescale by comparing the net present discounted marginal damages of CH
  <sub>4</sub> to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> shows the relationship between the discount rate and the GWP timescale. Here we focus on what discount rates are consistent with a GWP time horizon in order to show the discount rates implied by common choices of GWP timescales. The converse calculation is relevant for an audience that has a preferred discount rate and is interested in the implied GWP timescale.

 <p id="P20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, the discount rate implied by the GWP100 is 3.3% (interquartile range of 2.7% to 4.1 %). The discount rate implied by a 20-year GWP timescale is 12.6% (interquartile range of 11.1% to 14.6 %). The results in the figure are truncated to the year 2300 and the calculation is truncated to the year 2500, which may matter at very low discount rates due to the long lifetime of CO
  <sub>2</sub>. At a 3% discount rate, 90% of the discounted CO
  <sub>2</sub> damages from an emissions pulse comes in the first 157 years and 95% in 189 years. For CH
  <sub>4</sub>, the equivalent of 90 and 95% is 87 and 123 years, with the long tail on temperature effects causing elongated damages beyond the lifetime of the gas itself. Even at a 2% discount rate, 95% of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> damages come in the first 287 years. At discount rates lower than 2 %, however, truncation effects can account for errors in damage ratio estimates of greater than a percent, indicating that longer calculation timeframes may be necessary to capture the full effect of the emissions pulse.

 <p id="P21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is much discussion regarding which discount rates are most appropriate for use in evaluating climate damages. Since 2003, the US government has used discount rates of 3% and 7% to evaluate regulatory actions, and 3% was deemed appropriate for regulation that “primarily and directly affects private consumption” and 7% for regulations that “alter the use of capital in the private sector” (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">OMB, 2003</a>). From the current analysis, a 3% discount rate is consistent with a GWP of 118 years (interquartile range of 84–171 years) and 7% with a GWP of 38 years (interquartile range of 32–47 years). The OMB Circular also recognizes that there are special ethical considerations when impacts may accrue to future generations, and climate change is a prime example of an impact for which discount rates lower than 3% could be justified. A number of researchers have advocated for time-dependent declining discount rates (
  <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">Weitzman, 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">Newell and Pizer, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">Gollier et al., 2008</a>). The UK and France both already use declining discount rates in policy-making, and in both cases, the certainty equivalent discount rate drops below 3% within 100 years and approaches 2% within 300 years (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">Cropper et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="P22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper does not select a single “correct” discount rate. However, the analysis shows that the 100-year timescale is consistent, within the interquartile range, with the 3% discount rate that is commonly used for climate change analysis. In contrast, a 20-year time horizon for the GWP implies discount rates larger than those used in any climate change analysis publications to date.</p>
