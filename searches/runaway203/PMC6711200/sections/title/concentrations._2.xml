 <p id="P12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The perturbation due to a pulse of CO
  <sub>2</sub> is determined by the use of IPCC AR5 equations (see Table 8.SM.10 from the IPCC AR5 assessment). The perturbation due to a pulse of CH
  <sub>4</sub> is calculated by the use of a 12.4-year lifetime, consistent with Table 8.A.1 from IPCC AR5. In this paper, a pulse of 28.3 Mt of CH
  <sub>4</sub> is used (sufficient for a 10 ppb change in global CH
  <sub>4</sub> concentrations in the pulse year; results of a larger pulse are described in 
  <a rid="S12" ref-type="sec" href="#S12">Sect. 3.3</a>). The mass of the gas is converted to concentrations by assuming a molecular weight of air of 29 g mole
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and a mass of the atmosphere of 5.13 × 10
  <span class="sup">18</span>kg. These perturbations are added to baseline concentration pathways; for this study, we use the four RCP scenarios based on data from

This approach parallels the standard IPCC approach; however, various papers have noted that the lifetime of CO
  <sub>2</sub> presented in the IPCC includes climate carbon feedbacks, whereas the lifetime of CH
  <sub>4</sub> does not, which is a potential inconsistency (
