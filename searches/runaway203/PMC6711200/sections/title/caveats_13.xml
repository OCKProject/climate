 <p id="P35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis presented here suggests that the use of a 100-year time horizon for the GWP is in good agreement with what many consider an appropriate discount rate; however, we offer several caveats. Most importantly, this analysis makes the assumption that the net present damage of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub> is the best metric for evaluating the relative impact of gases. When analyzing several different common metrics, 
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">Azar and Johansson (2012)</a> asked whether society would prefer integrated metrics such as the GWP, single time period metrics such as the GTP, or economic metrics such as the global damage potential, which is parallel to the metric given primary weight in this paper. Considering the applications of a metric within the context of an integrated assessment model could enable the analysis of more complex economic interactions. Alternatively, a decision-making framework might consider factors other than damages; for example, in a multistage decision-making process under uncertainty, it might be possible that long-lived gas mitigation should be prioritized in order to increase future option value. Or there might be reasons to prioritize mitigation options that apply to capital stocks with long lifetimes or to decisions that involve path dependence, as those decisions would be more costly to reverse in the future.

 <p id="P36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This metric approach is also not designed to achieve a long-term temperature goal such as stabilization at 2 Â°C above preindustrial temperatures. We note that no metric designed to trade off emission pulses is consistent with stabilization. One solution to this dilemma is the GWP* introduced by 
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">Allen et al. (2016)</a>, which creates an equivalence between an emission pulse of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and a constant stream of CH
  <sub>4</sub>. This analysis only looks at a pulse of emissions in 2011 and does not examine whether the equivalent timescale might change over time.
