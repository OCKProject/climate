  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> shows the median, interquartile, interdecile, and extremes of the equivalent GWP time horizon corresponding to a given discount rate from a sensitivity analysis. The uncertainty was calculated assuming equal likelihood of each of the 972 combinations of all of the parameter choices used in this paper: four RCPs, three climate sensitivities, three damage exponents, three forcing imbalance options, three temperature offsets, and three GDP growth rates. The ranges chosen for each parameter are described in the 
  <a rid="S2" ref-type="sec" href="#S2">Methods</a> section. The parameters with the largest effect on the uncertainty of the calculated GWP (at a discount rate of 3 %) are the rate of GDP growth and the damage exponent (see 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). For these six parameters, the choices that lead to larger damages from CH
  <sub>4</sub> relative to CO
  <sub>2</sub> are a low GDP growth, a low damage exponent, a low-emissions scenario, a higher temperature offset (e.g., assuming that damages are a function of warming from preindustrial, not warming from present day), a lower climate sensitivity, and a higher current forcing imbalance. The general trend is that the more that damages are expected to grow in the future (e.g., high GDP growth, damage exponent, or emissions scenario), the longer the equivalent timescale is for a given discount rate.

 <p id="P24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> are the largest contributors to climate change (as evaluated by contributions of historical emissions to present-day radiative forcing as in Table 8.SM.6 in the IPCC and by the magnitude of present-day emissions as evaluated by the standard GWP100), it is also informative to evaluate emissions of other gases with these techniques. 
  <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a> shows five gases and their atmospheric lifetimes. For each gas, an “optimal” GWP timescale was calculated that would replicate the ratio of net present damage of that gas to CO
  <sub>2</sub> at a discount rate of 3 %. The ratio of the GWP100 and the GWP20 to that optimal damage ratio is also shown. For longer-lived gases (e.g., N
  <sub>2</sub>O and HFC-23), there is no integration time period that can produce a ratio as large as the calculated damage ratio at a discount rate of 3 %. For these gases, we list the timescale that yields the maximum possible ratio and note that the GWP for longer-lived gases is fairly insensitive to timescale (further comparisons of non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> gases are presented in the 
  <a rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#SD1">Supplement</a>). This table shows that at a discount rate of 3% and as evaluated using net present damage ratios, the use of a 100-year timescale is consistent (interquartile range) with the optimal timescale / damage ratios for methane. For gases with lifetimes in centuries, the GWP at any timescale undervalues these gases, but the magnitude of that undervaluation is somewhat insensitive to the choice of timescale. For the longest-lived gases, the GWP also undervalues reductions in these gases, but the longer the timescale the better the match.

 <p id="P25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to investigating the sensitivity of these results to different choices of the six listed parameters and five different gases, several other sensitivity experiments were performed. These experiments were chosen to investigate whether certain assumptions are important and alternate approaches to constructing the model.</p>
 <p id="P26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first set of experiments involve analysis choices that end up having little difference in terms of timescale estimation. In general, this is because changes in these choices affect both the GWP and the damage estimation equally and therefore cancel out. One experiment involved changing the size of the emissions pulse to 373 MMT (about 1 year of anthropogenic emissions according to 
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">Saunois et al., 2016</a>). The effect on damage ratios of this change was less than 1 %. Another experiment involved doubling the radiative efficiency of methane; while this led to a doubling of the estimated damage ratio, it also led to a doubling of the estimated GWP such that the change in estimated timescale was about 1/10 of 1 %. This experiment confirms that timescale estimates are insensitive to updates to estimates of the radiative efficiency of individual gases (such as the finding of 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">Etminan et al., 2016</a>, that methane has greater forcing effects than previously estimated). A third experiment arose because of the question of consistency between the treatment of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> in terms of climate–carbon feedbacks (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Gasser et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" href="#R58">Sterner and Johansson, 2017</a>). Using the CO
  <sub>2</sub> lifetime from 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">Gasser et al. (2017)</a> without climate–carbon feedbacks, an increase in damage ratios of about 8% was estimated, but a similar increase in GWP of about 7% was estimated, with a net effect on timescales of less than 1 %. The converse experiment (including climate-carbon feedbacks in both the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> lifetimes) was not analyzed due to the increased complexity of the calculation. However, given that the virtue of the GWP is its simplicity, the authors suggest that the use of lifetimes without climate–carbon feedbacks for either gas should be preferred over the inclusion of those feedbacks in the lifetimes of both gases (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">Sarofim, 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="P27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another experiment considered the use of a Ramseytype framework for discounting future damages. The use of such a framework has been recommended by the National Academies (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">NAS, 2017</a>). In this framework, discount rates are a function of the marginal utility of consumption, the pure rate of time preference, and the future growth rate of per capita consumption. It is the latter dependence that makes this sensitivity analysis particularly interesting, as this pairs higher consumption growth (leading to higher damage ratios) with higher discount rates (leading to lower damage ratios). For this experiment, the Ramsey parameters were calibrated to yield an average discount rate for the reference GDP of 5% over the first 30 years of the analysis given a pure rate of time preference of 0.01 %. Under this assumption, the median timescale under the reference GDP scenario increases to 135 years because even though the initial discount rates are higher than 3 %, over the entire period of the analysis the average discount rate is only 1.5 %. However, unlike in the original analysis, under the high GDP growth scenario the damage ratio increases and the equivalent timescale decreases to 90 years because the increase in discount rate resulting from high growth has a larger effect on damages than the long-term increase in GDP (and vice versa for low GDP growth). The difference between the damage ratios for the high and low GDP growth scenarios is still about a factor of 2. A future analysis could pair GDP scenarios with emissions scenarios to take into account the potential correlation of the two.

 <p id="P28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">Boucher (2012)</a> and 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al. (2003)</a> both applied similar approaches to the one used in this paper, but both papers identified a discount rate consistent with the GWP100 that was somewhat lower than the median 3.3% value found in this paper. The most evident difference between the approach in these previous papers and this article is that this article assumes that damages are expressed as a percent of GDP, and the previous analyses did not. In order to more closely emulate the Boucher and Fuglestvedt approach, the model was tested by using constant GDP over the entire time period, and the GWP100 was found to be the most consistent with a discount rate of 1.2% (interquartile range of 1.0% to 1.9 %) in contrast to 3.3% (interquartile range of 2.7% to 4.1 %).
 </p>
 <p id="P29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">Myhre et al. (2013)</a> justified the exclusion of the 500-year GWP based on the large uncertainties and ambiguities involved with far future projections. This analysis extends through 2500 and therefore might be subject to some of those same uncertainties. Therefore, the effect of two shorter time periods was investigated. When truncating the analysis after 150 years, the GWP100 was still found to be consistent with a discount rate of 3.3 %, with the upper interquartile bound also remaining constant at 4.1 %, though the lower end of the interquartile range decreased modestly to 2.4 %. When the analysis was truncated at 100 years into the future, the implicit discount rates dropped more substantially, to 2.6% (interquartile range of 1.5% to 3.5 %). Truncating the analysis will naturally make CH
  <sub>4</sub> mitigation appear more favorable relative to CO
  <sub>2</sub>, but even discount rates as small as 3% are sufficient to make effects more than 150 years into the future inconsequential to the results.
 </p>
 <p id="P30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final experiment considered the inclusion of damages due to rate of change and due to absolute temperature. The inclusion of rate-of-change damages has had important influences on previous analyses. For example, in 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">Manne and Richels (2001)</a>, the dynamic optimization solution for approaching a temperature threshold placed little value on CH
  <sub>4</sub> reduction relative to CO
  <sub>2</sub> until a couple decades before the threshold was reached; but when a rate-of-change requirement was added, the relative value of CH
  <sub>4</sub> reduction stayed fairly constant over the time period. The challenge for this analysis is in determining the appropriate damage form, as the literature for estimating damages due to rate of change is not as robust as for absolute changes. As a test case, the peak rate-of-change damages under the median parameter values were calibrated to be equal to the absolute damages in the year 2060 (50 years into the analysis). The effect of the inclusion of this effect was to increase the damage ratio of CH
  <sub>4</sub> to CO
  <sub>2</sub> by 2.4 %. This fairly modest impact is consistent with the results of 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">Bowerman et al. (2013)</a> and 
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">Rogelj et al. (2015)</a>, which suggest that near-term mitigation of SLCFs has modest effects on reducing the peak rate of change for higher future emissions scenarios and that delayed SLCF mitigation may yield most of the same benefits as immediate SLCF mitigation in terms of both peak absolute change and rate of change. In order examine how this effect could be sensitive to a lower emissions scenario, the analysis was repeated for the RCP3PD scenario by itself. Under this assumption, the damage ratio increases by 53 %, resulting in a decrease in the optimal timescale for RCP3PD associated with a discount rate of 3% from 94 to 54 years. This result is also consistent with Bowerman et al., who found more benefit in reducing near-term SLCF emissions if future emissions are expected to be low.
