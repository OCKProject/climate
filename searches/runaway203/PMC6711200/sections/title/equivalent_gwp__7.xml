 <p id="P17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above calculations produce net present damages resulting from a pulse of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and for a pulse of the same mass CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The ratio of these two values is a measure of the relative impact of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub>. This measure of relative impact can be used to calculate the equivalent GWP timescale that would produce the same ratio.
