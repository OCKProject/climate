 <p id="P31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of uncertainties involved in this analysis. They can be divided into three categories: those that may change the relative climate-related discounted damages of CH
  <sub>4</sub> compared to CO
  <sub>2</sub> but have minimal effect on the implied timescale of the GWP, those that have a large impact on the implied timescale, and those effects of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub> that are unrelated to their climate forcing.
 </p>
 <p id="P32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown above, uncertainties in this analysis that do not have a large impact on the calculated GWP timescale include factors that have similar effects on the GWP and the CH
  <sub>4</sub> : CO
  <sub>2</sub> discounted damage ratio, such as radiative efficiency and consistent treatment of climate–carbon feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="P33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the timescale of ocean heat uptake, the lag between the timing of atmospheric temperature response to forcing and the response of sea level (e.g., 
  <a rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" href="#R68">Zickfeld et al., 2017</a>), and other issues that are inherent to the timing of climate impacts – but are not necessarily included in the GWP calculation – might all affect the implied timescale. One potential way to explore some of these effects would be to use a more complex climate model to evaluate the radiative forcing and temperature effects of the emission pulses. The shape of the damage function can also have a substantial effect; different exponents for the polynomial form were tested, as was the inclusion of rate of change, but the full range of possible damage functions is substantially larger, including multi-polynomial behavior (
  <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">Weitzman, 2001</a>) and the potential for persistent influences on economic growth (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">Burke et al., 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="P34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional category of effects has less relevance to an analysis of an appropriate timescale for climate impacts, but would be important for overall valuation. These are generally gas-specific effects that should most appropriately be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than folding into a timescale analysis that will influence the mitigation choices for all gases. One example is the inclusion of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects, which would reduce the relative importance of decreasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> compared to other gases. Other examples include the health effects of O
  <sub>3</sub> produced by reaction of CH
  <sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere (
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">Shindell et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">Sarofim et al., 2017</a>), CO
  <sub>2</sub> effects on ocean acidification, and the possible reduced efficacy of CH
  <sub>4</sub> compared to CO
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">Modak et al., 2018</a>). These effects can be important for making mitigation decisions but are outside of the scope of consideration for a study focusing on how to choose a time horizon for comparing climate impacts. As an example, if the solution to undervaluing CH
  <sub>4</sub> mitigation due to its O
  <sub>3</sub> effects is to reduce the appropriate timescale for GHG comparisons, an identical gas without O
  <sub>3</sub> chemistry implications would be similarly prioritized. One potential approach that could be explored might be to apply a multiplier to the GWP after calculation to take into account these non-climatic effects, much like the GWP of methane takes into account indirect effects on climate through the production of tropospheric O
  <sub>3</sub> and stratospheric H
  <sub>2</sub>O by the use of a multiplicative factor.
