 <p id="P37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis uses a global damage potential approach to calculate the implicit discount rate corresponding to different GWP timescales. While this is not the first analysis to calculate the implicit discount rate of the 100-year GWP (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">Boucher, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al., 2003</a>), the framework presented here allows for a more complete and wide-ranging analysis of sensitivities than has been presented previously, and the connection between the timescale and the implicit discount rate is made more clearly. The 100-year GWP is the inter-gas comparison metric with the widest use, and the results presented here show that the 100-year timescale is consistent with an implied discount rate of 3.3% (interquartile range of 2.7% to 4.1 %). Alternatively, the 3% discount rate used for calculating social damages in some regulatory impact analysis contexts is consistent with timescales of 84–171 years. The uncertainty range in the results is the most sensitive to assumptions regarding future GDP growth and to the choice of exponent in the damage function. These results are insensitive to assumptions regarding radiative efficiency, pulse size, and consistent treatment of climate–carbon feedbacks. At discount rates of 3% or higher, the analysis can be truncated to 150 years (rather than the default calculation through 2500) with little effect. The inclusion of damages resulting from the rate of change in addition to absolute temperature changes has little effect except in the case of a low-emissions future, for which it results in a decrease in the timescale consistent with a 3% discount rate to 54 years. Applying the methodology in this paper to calculate the implied intertemporal values of a 20-year GWP, a timescale that has received some recent attention, results in an implicit discount rate of 12.6% (interquartile range of 11.1% to 14.6 %).

 <p id="P38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results provide support for the contention that 100 years is a reasonable timescale choice for the GWP given the assumption that the relative climate damage of pulses of different greenhouse gases is an appropriate means of valuation and that the 3% discount rate is a reasonable measure of the value of the future. This finding is robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. In contrast, the analysis suggests that the 20-year GWP timescale is the most consistent with an implicit discount rate much higher than the standard social discount rate, except in scenarios with low future emissions and high rate-of-change damages, similar to concerns expressed in other analyses (
  <a rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" href="#R55">Shoemaker and Schrag, 2013</a>). However, while the implicit timescale was derived from analyzing the climate impacts resulting from CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions relative to CO
  <sub>2</sub> climate impacts, the results do not necessarily inform a specific relative importance of CH
  <sub>4</sub> mitigation compared to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Such a relative importance calculation should take into account the latest research on radiative efficiencies (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">Etminan et al., 2016</a>) and could potentially also take into account non-climate impacts like the health effects of CH
  <sub>4</sub>-derived O
  <sub>3</sub> (
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">Shindell, 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">Sarofim et al., 2017</a>). The inclusion of non-climate impacts could perhaps use an adjustment factor in the same way that the CH
  <sub>4</sub> GWP already includes adjustment factors for the climate effects of CH
  <sub>4</sub>-derived O
  <sub>3</sub>. Additionally, the appropriate GWP timescales can also be informed by the manner in which the metric is being used for policy or informational purposes.

 <p id="P39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methodology presented here is transparent (the code is available in the 
  <a rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#SD1">Supplement</a>), rigorous (the parameters and functional forms are derived from respected sources), and flexible (as demonstrated by a wide range of sensitivity analyses from the inclusion of rate-of-change damages to Ramsey discounting). This framework can be a valuable resource for quantitatively examining appropriate timescales given different assumptions about discounting, the relationship of damages to both absolute and rate of temperature changes, tipping points, future emissions scenarios, and other factors.
