 <p id="P3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global warming potential (GWP) is the primary metric used to assess the equivalency of emissions of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) for use in multi-gas policies and aggregate inventories. This primacy was established soon after its development in 1990 (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">Lashof and Ahuja, 1990</a>; 
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">Rodhe, 1990</a>) due to its early use by the 
  <a rid="R65" ref-type="bibr" href="#R65">WMO (1992)</a> and 
  <a rid="R60" ref-type="bibr" href="#R60">UNFCCC (1995)</a>. However, despite the GWP’s long history of political acceptance, the GWP has also been a source of controversy and criticism (e.g., 
  <a rid="R64" ref-type="bibr" href="#R64">Wigley et al., 1998</a>; 
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">Shine et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">Allen et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">Edwards et al., 2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="P4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key criticisms of the metric are wide ranging. Criticisms include the following: that radiative forcing as a measure of impact is not as relevant as temperature or damages (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">Shine et al., 2005</a>); that the assumption of constant future GHG concentrations (
  <a rid="R66" ref-type="bibr" href="#R66">Wuebbles et al., 1995</a>; 
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">Reisinger et al., 2011</a>) is unrealistic; that discounting is preferred to a constant time period of integration (
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">Schmalensee, 1993</a>); disagreements about the choice of time horizon in the absence of discounting (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">Ocko et al., 2017</a>); that dynamic approaches would lead to a more optimal resource allocation over time (e.g., 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">Manne and Richels, 2001</a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">2006</a>); that the GWP does not account for non-climatic effects such as carbon fertilization or ozone produced by methane (
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">Shindell, 2015</a>); and that pulses of emissions are less relevant than streams of emissions (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">Alvarez et al., 2012</a>). Unfortunately, including these complicating factors would make the metric less simple and transparent and would require reaching a consensus regarding appropriate parameter values, model choices, and other methodology issues. The simplicity of the calculation of the GWP is one of the reasons that the use of the metric is so widespread.
 </p>
 <p id="P5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we focus on the choice of time horizon in the GWP as a key choice that can reflect decision-maker values, but for which additional clarity regarding the implications of the time horizon could be useful. We also investigate the extent to which the choice of time horizon can incorporate many of the complexities of assessing the impacts described in the previous paragraph. The 100-year time horizon of the GWP (GWP100) is the time horizon most commonly used in many venues, for example in trading regimes such as under the Kyoto Protocol, perhaps in part because it was the middle value of the three time horizons (20, 100, and 500 years) analyzed in the IPCC First Assessment Report. However, the 100-year time horizon has been described by some as arbitrary (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">Rodhe, 1990</a>). The IPCC AR5 (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">Myhre et al., 2013</a>) stated that “[t]here is no scientific argument for selecting 100 years compared with other choices”. The 
  <a rid="R65" ref-type="bibr" href="#R65">WMO (1992)</a> assessment has provided one of the few justifications for the 100-year time horizon, stating that “the GWPs evaluated over the 100-year period appear generally to provide a balanced representation of the various time horizons for climate response”. Recently, some researchers and NGOs have been promoting more emphasis on shorter time horizons, such as 20 years, which would highlight the role of short-lived climate forcers such as CH
  <sub>4</sub> (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">Howarth et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">Edwards and Trancik, 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">Ocko et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" href="#R53">Shindell et al., 2017</a>). These studies each have different nuances regarding their recommendations – for example, 
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">Ocko et al. (2017)</a> suggest pairing the GWP100 with the GWP20 to reflect both long-term and near-term climate impacts – and therefore there is no simple summary of the policy implications of this body of literature, but it is plausible that more consideration of short-term metrics would result in policy that weights near-term impacts more heavily. In contrast, some governments have suggested the use of the 100-year global temperature change potential (GTP) based on the greater physical relevance of temperature in comparison to forcing, in effect downplaying the role of the same short-lived climate forcers (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">Chang-Ke et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">Brazil INDC, 2015</a>). Therefore, the question of timescale remains unsettled and an area of active debate. We argue that more focus on quantitative justifications for timescales within the GWP structure would be of value, as differentiated from qualitative justifications such as a need for urgency to avoid tipping points as in 
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">Howarth et al. (2012)</a>.
 </p>
 <p id="P6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we argue that quantitative justifications for choosing appropriate GWP timescales are rare, as reflected by the judgment of the IPCC authors that no scientific arguments exist for selecting given timescales, there is a rich literature addressing many aspects of climate metrics. 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">Deuber et al. (2013)</a> present a conceptual framework for evaluating climate metrics, laying out the different choices involved in choosing the measure of impact of radiative forcing, temperature, or damages, and temporal weighting functions that can be integrative (whether discounted or time horizon based) or based on single future time points. 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">Deuber et al. (2013)</a> conclude that the global damage potential (GDP) could be considered a “first-best benchmark metric”, but recognize that the time-horizon-based GWP has advantages based on limiting value-based judgments to a choice of time horizon, reducing scientific uncertainty by limiting the calculations of atmospheric effects to radiative forcing, and eliminating scenario uncertainty by assuming constant background concentrations. 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">Mallapragada and Mignone (2017)</a> present a similar framework and also note that metrics can consider a single pulse of a stream of pulses over multiple years. Several authors have recognized that under certain simplifying assumptions, the GWP is equivalent to the integrated GTP, and therefore any timescale arguments that apply to analyses of one metric would also apply to the other (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">Shine et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">Sarofim, 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="P7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few papers have applied GDP-type approaches to evaluate the GWP in a manner similar to that of this paper. 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">Boucher (2012)</a> uses an uncertainty analysis similar to that used in this paper to estimate the GDP of methane. Boucher found that the GDP was highly sensitive to discount rate over a range of 1% to 3% and damage function over a range of polynomial exponents of 1.5 to 2.5 and that the median value of the GDP was very similar to the GWP100. 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al. (2003)</a> also used a GDP approach to map time horizons and damage function exponents to a discount rate using IS92a as an emission scenario. 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al. (2003)</a> found that a discount rate of 1.75% and a damage exponent of 2 led to results equivalent to a GWP100. 
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">De Cara (2005)</a>, in an unpublished manuscript, also calculated the relationship between discount rates and time horizon, though they assumed linear damages.
 </p>
 <p id="P8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternate approach is to evaluate metrics within the context of an integrated assessment model (IAM). There are several examples of such an approach. 
  <a rid="R61" ref-type="bibr" href="#R61">Van den Berg et al. (2015)</a> analyze the implications of the use of 20-, 100-, and 500-year GWPs for CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O reductions over time within an IAM. The analysis estimated optimal costs to meet a 3.5 Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span> target in 2100 and found that use of the GWP20 and GWP100 resulted in similar costs (within 4 %), but that use of the GWP500 resulted in higher costs by 18 %. A key caveat here, as with many such analyses (including the present Sarofim and Giordano paper), is that the structure of the test can drive the evaluation result: in the case of 
  <a rid="R61" ref-type="bibr" href="#R61">van den Berg et al. (2015)</a>, the analysis ends in 2100, which will reduce the evaluated benefits of long-term metrics, particularly for reductions that occur at the end of the century. These IAMs often use a discount rate of 5% for their net present value analysis. Other IAM analyses have concluded that changing the CH
  <sub>4</sub> to CO
  <sub>2</sub> ratio away from the GWP100 has small effects on policy costs and climate outcomes (e.g., 
  <a rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" href="#R57">Smith et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">Reisinger et al., 2013</a>). This is in large part because marginal abatement curves for CH
  <sub>4</sub> within these models have low-cost options (likely representing mitigation options such as landfill gas to energy projects and oil and gas leakage reduction) and high-cost options (reductions of enteric fermentation emissions from livestock) but few moderate-cost options. Therefore, for even a moderate carbon price, all the low-cost options will be enacted regardless of GWP, and no matter what the GWP, few high-cost options will be enacted. Such analyses may not fully consider nonmarket barriers or distributional effects for which changes in the GWP could be important.

 <p id="P9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this paper focuses on a cost–benefit approach, there is also a potential need for cost–efficiency approaches, particularly in regard to stabilization targets such as 2 °C. However, a number of authors have argued that pulse-based metrics such as the GWP are not well-suited to achieve stabilization goals (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">Sarofim et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">Smith et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">Allen et al., 2016</a>). Some actors (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">Brazil INDC, 2015</a>) have claimed that certain metrics such as the global temperature potential (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">Shine et al., 2005</a>) or the climate tipping potential (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">Jorgensen et al., 2014</a>) are more compatible with a stabilization target such as 2 °C because they are temperature based. However, any pulse-based approach faces at least two major challenges related to stabilization scenarios. The first is that as a temperature target is approached, a dynamic approach will shift from favoring long-lived gas mitigation to favoring short-lived gases. While this shift may be optimal for meeting a target in a single year, it will be suboptimal for any year after that year. The second challenge is that once stabilization has been achieved, any trading between emission pulses of carbon dioxide and a shorter-lived gas will cause a deviation from stabilization. For example, trading a reduction in methane emissions for a pulse of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions will lead to a near-term decrease in temperature, but also a long-term increase in temperature above the original stabilization level. One solution to the problem is a physically based one. 
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">Allen et al. (2016)</a> suggest trading an emission pulse of carbon dioxide against a sustained change in the emissions of a short-lived climate forcer. This resolves the issue of trading off what is effectively a permanent temperature change against a transient one. However, the challenge becomes one of implementation, as current policy structures are not designed for addressing indefinite sustained mitigation. A second solution is a dynamically updating global cost potential approach that optimizes shadow prices of different gases given a stabilization constraint (
  <a rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" href="#R59">Tol et al., 2012</a>), but again, implementation would be challenging. Alternatively, a number of researchers (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">Daniel et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">Jackson, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">Smith et al., 2012</a>) suggest addressing CO
  <sub>2</sub> mitigation separately from short-lived gases. Such a separation recognizes the value of the cumulative carbon concept in setting GHG mitigation policy (
  <a rid="R67" ref-type="bibr" href="#R67">Zickfeld et al., 2009</a>). However, this approach requires a central decision-maker and loses the “what” flexibility that makes the use of metrics appealing (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">Bohringer et al., 2006</a>). In economic terms, a temperature-based target is equivalent to the assumption of infinite damage beyond that threshold temperature and zero damages below that threshold (Tol et al., 2016).
 </p>
 <p id="P10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper provides a needed quantification and analysis of the implications of different GWP time horizons. We follow the lead of economists who have proposed that the appropriate comparison for different options for GHG emissions policies is between the net present discounted marginal damages (
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">Schmalensee, 1993</a>; 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">Deuber et al., 2013</a>). However, instead of proposing a switch to a GDP metric, we take the structure of the GWP as a given due to the simplicity of calculation and the widespread historic acceptance of its use. While other analysts have used similar approaches (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">Fuglestvedt et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">Boucher, 2012</a>), this paper reframes and clarifies key issues and presents a framework for better understanding how different timescales can be reconciled with how the future is valued. The paper focuses on CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> as the two most important historical anthropogenic contributors to current warming, but the methodology is applicable to emissions of other gases, and sensitivity analyses consider N
  <sub>2</sub>O and some fluorinated gases.
