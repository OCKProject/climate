 <p id="P13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The perturbation of radiative forcing from additional GHG concentrations is based on the equations in Table 8.SM.1 from IPCC AR5. CH
  <sub>4</sub> forcing is adjusted by a factor of 1.65 to account for effects on tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor, as is standard in GWP calculations. N
  <sub>2</sub>O forcing is adjusted by a factor of 0.928 to account for N
  <sub>2</sub>O impacts on CH
  <sub>4</sub> concentrations, as is also standard in GWP calculations. Baseline radiative forcing is derived from the RCP scenario database.
