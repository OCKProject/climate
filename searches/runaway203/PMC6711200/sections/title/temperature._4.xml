 <p id="P14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature calculations are all based on IPCC AR5 Table 8.SM.11.2. It should be noted that the IPCC equations were designed for marginal emissions changes; therefore, using this approach to calculate temperatures resulting from the background RCPs and the additional emissions pulses introduces a potential uncertainty. In order to calculate future temperatures, we also account for the present-day radiative forcing imbalance. 
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">Medhaug et al. (2017)</a> suggest that this imbalance likely lies between 0.75 and 0.93Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. We use the mean (0.84Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) as the central estimate and the range of this estimate in the sensitivity analysis presented above. The sum of the coefficients of the equations in the IPCC temperature impulse response functions (1.06) is the sensitivity of the climate to an additional Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>; assuming that a doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub> yields 3.7Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, then the climate sensitivity implied by the IPCC suggested coefficients is 3.92. As a sensitivity analysis, the coefficients were scaled to yield climate sensitivities of 1.5 and 4.5 to mirror the likely range estimated by the IPCC.
