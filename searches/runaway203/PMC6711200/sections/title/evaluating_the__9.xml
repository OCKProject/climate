  <sub>4</sub>
 </div>
 <p id="P18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis starts by calculating the climate effects of an emission pulse of CH
  <sub>4</sub>. We introduce an emission pulse of 28.3MT in 2011 (yielding a 10 ppb increase in CH
  <sub>4</sub> concentration in the initial year) applied on top of the GHG concentrations of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">Myhre et al., 2013</a>). 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> shows the changes in radiative forcing (RF; a), temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>; b), damages (c), and damages discounted at a 3% rate (d) out to the year 2300 resulting from such a pulse. 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> relies on calculations that use central estimates of the uncertain parameters, as discussed in the 
  <a rid="S2" ref-type="sec" href="#S2">Methods</a> section. While the graph is truncated at 2300, the calculations used in this paper extend to 2500. The impacts of an emission pulse of CO
  <sub>2</sub> are also shown using 24.8 times the mass of the CH
  <sub>4</sub> pulse (this factor is chosen to create equivalent integrated damages over the full time period when discounted at 3% as shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1d</a>). 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1a</a> and 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">b</a> demonstrate the trade-offs between near-term and long-term impacts when assigning equivalency to emission pulses of different lifetimes. After 100 years, the radiative forcing effects of the CH
  <sub>4</sub> pulse decay to 0.04% of the initial forcing in the year of the emission pulse, and the temperature effects decay to 4% of the peak temperature (reached 10 years after the pulse). In contrast, after 100 years the radiative forcing effects of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> pulse decay to 22% of the initial forcing, and the temperature effects decay to 51% of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> peak temperature (reached 18 years after the pulse). The immediacy of the temperature effects for the CH
  <sub>4</sub> pulse creates larger damages in both overall and discounted dollar terms for the first 42 years. After 43 years, the sustained CO
  <sub>2</sub> effects overtake the CH
  <sub>4</sub> effects. With a different discount rate, a different factor would have been used to calculate the CO
  <sub>2</sub> mass used for the CO
  <sub>2</sub> pulse, which would change the crossing point for damages – a higher discount rate would require a larger CO
  <sub>2</sub> equivalent pulse relative to the CH
  <sub>4</sub> pulse and therefore an earlier crossing point (and vice versa). 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1c</a> demonstrates the dramatic increase in damage over time due to the relationship of damage to economic growth. In the case of CH
  <sub>4</sub>, damage peaks in 2032 and declines until 2080 as a result of the short lifetime of the gas. The increase in damages after 2080 is due to the component of the temperature response function that includes a 409-year timescale decay rate such that after 100 years the decrease in the Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> component of the damage equation is about 0.5% year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and because that decay rate is slower than the rate of GDP growth, net damages grow. 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figure 1d</a> demonstrates the dramatic decrease in future damages when applying a constant discount rate. Taken as a whole, these four figures demonstrate the trade-offs required when attempting to create equivalences for emissions of gases with very different lifetimes.
