 <p id="P11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general approach taken in this paper is to calculate the impact of a pulse of emissions of either CO
  <sub>2</sub> or CH
  <sub>4</sub> in the first year of simulation on a series of climatic variables. The first step is to calculate the perturbation of atmospheric concentrations over a baseline scenario. The concentration perturbation is transformed into a change in the global radiative forcing balance. The radiative forcing perturbation over time is used to calculate the impact on temperature and then damages due to that temperature change. Discount rates are then applied to these impacts to determine the net present value of the impacts. The details of these calculations are described here.

  <p id="P12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The perturbation due to a pulse of CO
   <sub>2</sub> is determined by the use of IPCC AR5 equations (see Table 8.SM.10 from the IPCC AR5 assessment). The perturbation due to a pulse of CH
   <sub>4</sub> is calculated by the use of a 12.4-year lifetime, consistent with Table 8.A.1 from IPCC AR5. In this paper, a pulse of 28.3 Mt of CH
   <sub>4</sub> is used (sufficient for a 10 ppb change in global CH
   <sub>4</sub> concentrations in the pulse year; results of a larger pulse are described in 
   <a rid="S12" ref-type="sec" href="#S12">Sect. 3.3</a>). The mass of the gas is converted to concentrations by assuming a molecular weight of air of 29 g mole
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and a mass of the atmosphere of 5.13 × 10
   <span class="sup">18</span>kg. These perturbations are added to baseline concentration pathways; for this study, we use the four RCP scenarios based on data from

This approach parallels the standard IPCC approach; however, various papers have noted that the lifetime of CO
   <sub>2</sub> presented in the IPCC includes climate carbon feedbacks, whereas the lifetime of CH
   <sub>4</sub> does not, which is a potential inconsistency (

  <p id="P13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The perturbation of radiative forcing from additional GHG concentrations is based on the equations in Table 8.SM.1 from IPCC AR5. CH
   <sub>4</sub> forcing is adjusted by a factor of 1.65 to account for effects on tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor, as is standard in GWP calculations. N
   <sub>2</sub>O forcing is adjusted by a factor of 0.928 to account for N
   <sub>2</sub>O impacts on CH
   <sub>4</sub> concentrations, as is also standard in GWP calculations. Baseline radiative forcing is derived from the RCP scenario database.

  <p id="P14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature calculations are all based on IPCC AR5 Table 8.SM.11.2. It should be noted that the IPCC equations were designed for marginal emissions changes; therefore, using this approach to calculate temperatures resulting from the background RCPs and the additional emissions pulses introduces a potential uncertainty. In order to calculate future temperatures, we also account for the present-day radiative forcing imbalance. 
   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">Medhaug et al. (2017)</a> suggest that this imbalance likely lies between 0.75 and 0.93Wm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. We use the mean (0.84Wm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) as the central estimate and the range of this estimate in the sensitivity analysis presented above. The sum of the coefficients of the equations in the IPCC temperature impulse response functions (1.06) is the sensitivity of the climate to an additional Wm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>; assuming that a doubling of CO
   <sub>2</sub> yields 3.7Wm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, then the climate sensitivity implied by the IPCC suggested coefficients is 3.92. As a sensitivity analysis, the coefficients were scaled to yield climate sensitivities of 1.5 and 4.5 to mirror the likely range estimated by the IPCC.

  <p id="P15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Damages as a percent of GDP were calculated by multiplying a constant by the square of the temperature change since the baseline period. For example, 
   <span class="italic">D</span>(2050) = 
   <span class="italic">a</span> · Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>(2050)
   <span class="sup">2</span>· GDP. The net present value is then calculated using the discount rate such that NPV(

   <span class="italic">t</span>)) = 
   <span class="italic">D</span>(

   </span>. 
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">Hsiang et al. (2017)</a> present a recent justification for using a quadratic function for damages. For the sensitivity analysis, damage exponents of 1.5 or 3 were considered. Other formulations of the damage function have been considered in the literature. The first alternative is explicit calculation of damages within integrated assessment models. Another alternative is to include a higher-power term in addition to the square exponent so that at low temperatures damages rise quadratically, but at high temperatures damages accelerate (
   <a rid="R63" ref-type="bibr" href="#R63">Weitzman, 2010</a>). Finally, some analyses account for the impact of climate change on the economic growth rate, finding substantially higher damages (

   <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">Moore and Diaz, 2015</a>). The damage constant (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) (which cancels out in this particular application) and the GDP pathway are taken from the Nordhaus DICE model (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">Nordhaus, 2017</a>). Sensitivity analyses used a growth of 0.5 and 1.5 times that of the baseline growth for each 5-year time period in the Nordhaus scenario. The GDP growth rates over the 21st century from DICE (2.5 %) and the high and low growth rate scenarios (1.3% and 3.8 %) are consistent with the estimate of 21st century per capita GDP growth from 
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">Christensen et al. (2018)</a> of 2.1% (with a standard deviation of 1.1 %), when added to the population growth rate of 0.4% from DICE (see the 
   <a rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#SD1">Supplement</a> for a graph of the GDP scenarios). A temperature offset was also used because it is not clear what baseline temperature should be used for the damage function. A central value of 0.6 °C (the temperature change from 1951– 1980 compared to 2011 based on the NASA GISSTemp surface temperature record; 
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">GISTEMP, 2017</a>) is used, with sensitivities of 0 °C as a lower bound and 0.8 °C (the temperature change from 1880 to 2012 from the 2014 National Climate Assessment) as an upper bound. For the RCP3PD scenario, some future years (fewer than 1 out of 1000 of the total years considered across all sensitivities and generally only for years near the end of the analysis) are cooler than the baseline temperature; in those years the net temperature change is set to zero to avoid numerical problems.
