         <p>Recent and projected surface air temperatures in context of past abrupt warming events

            warming in concert with abrupt warming in the mid-latitude North Pacific and North
            Atlantic basins (

            <span>b</span> represent the locations for the paleoclimate datasets plotted in 
            <span>c</span>. Record-breaking Arctic warming in recent years was associated with anomalously high
            SSTs in the Northeast Pacific despite a cold spot in the North Atlantic (
            <span>a</span>). Projected SATs show an amplified response in the Arctic and North Pacific, whereas
            North Atlantic SSTs undergo relatively modest warming in the first century (
