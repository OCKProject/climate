      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) surface air temperature anomalies
         for 2080–2100 (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>) in the RCP 8.5 scenario were calculated as an average of the following 23 models
         relative to their average surface air temperature of the historical simulations: ACCESS1-0,
         ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1-m, bcc-csm1-1, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5,
         CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, FIO-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, GFDL-ESM2G, GISS-E2-H,
         GISS-E2-R, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M, NorESM1-ME.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface heat flux anomalies for RCP 8.5 were calculated using one model simulation
         from 37 CMIP5 models, based on the time-mean of years 2081–2100 in the RCP 8.5 scenario
         relative to the time-mean for the preindustrial control run over the first 200 years
         (Supplementary Figure 
         <a>12</a>).

         Environmental Laboratory and the Panoply software (version 4.6.2) developed by the
