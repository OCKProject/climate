      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To elucidate the mechanisms by which the North Pacific dominates the Arctic temperature
         response, we evaluate the climate feedbacks involved in the single-basin heat flux
         experiments. The additional ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux of +1 W/m
         <span>2</span> global-equivalent from the North Pacific (NP-Warm) results in annual surface temperature
         increases ranging from 0.5 to 6°C across the entire northern hemisphere, with warming
         concentrated across the North Pacific Ocean and Arctic (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Annual-mean Arctic sea ice is reduced by 7.36 ± 0.54% relative to the control simulation,
         with the greatest decline focused along the sea-ice edge in the Greenland and Barents
         Seas and in the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Surface warming is most pronounced in winter months (December–February) and is
         amplified along the North Atlantic sea-ice edge and northern Siberia (Supplementary
         Figure 
         <a>2</a>), where surface temperature anomalies reach 6–7°C in winter. The mean global and
         Arctic temperature anomalies in the NP-Warm simulation are +0.95 ± 0.03 and +3.08 ± 0.20°C,
         respectively.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the NA-Warm simulation elicits a more muted northern hemisphere warming compared
         to the NP-Warm simulation, with reduced surface warming in the Arctic, Northeastern
         Pacific, and North American continent. Annual-mean SSTs increase by 5–6°C near the
         region of modified heat flux, with smaller magnitudes of warming seen elsewhere in
         the northern hemisphere (0.5–3°C) (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Annual-mean sea-ice area decreases by 4.98 ± 0.56% relative to the control simulation,
         with the greatest decline in the Beaufort Sea, along the perimeter of northern Alaska.
         The mean global and Arctic temperature anomalies in the NA-Warm simulation are +0.79 ± 0.02
         and +2.12 ± 0.20°C, respectively.
