      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations were run for 100 model years and annual and seasonal averages were
         calculated for years 40–100 of the model output, with the exception of the NEP-Warm
         simulation, which was run for 60 model years with mean values calculated from years
         40 to 60. Reported errors are calculated as the standard error of the mean multiplied
         by 1.96, which is the number of standard deviations required to contain 95% of the
         area of a normal distribution. The calculation of the standard error of the mean assumes
         a sample size of 
         <span>N</span> independent samples, which in our case are the individual model years. Autocorrelation
         between model years, however, reduces the number of independent samples, as described
         by Santer et al.
         <span><a>54</a></span> This autocorrelation is corrected for by using Eq. (6) of Santer et al.
         <span><a>54</a></span> to determine an “effective sample size”, 
         <span>N</span><sub>e</sub>, that adjusts the original sample size for this autocorrelation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate the global climate feedback parameter (
         <span>α</span>) as 
         <span>F</span>/Δ
         <span>T</span>, where 
         <span>F</span> is the applied global radiative forcing (±1 W/m
         <span>2</span>) and Δ
         <span>T</span> is the change in global average surface air temperature
         <span><a>55</a></span>. The Arctic amplification factor is calculated as the ratio of the change in global
         surface air temperature to the change in Arctic surface air temperature (Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>global</sub>/Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>arctic</sub>) (Table 
         <a>1</a>). The cloud radiative forcing at the TOA is calculated as the difference in the net
         radiative flux between all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The greenhouse effect of
         clouds in the Arctic is calculated as the difference in the downwelling longwave radiation
         at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions
         <span><a>56</a></span>. We calculate the surface albedo forcing related to changes in sea-ice as the difference
         in upwelling shortwave radiation at the surface in clear-sky conditions. However,
         the enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation at the surface due to sea-ice retreat
         is in part compensated by enhanced shortwave reflection at the TOA due to changes
         in Arctic cloudiness. For example, the greater increase in Arctic cloud fraction in
         the NP-Warm contributes to an annual-mean negative cloud radiative effect at the top
         of the atmosphere (TOA) (−2.0 ± 0.36 and −1.7 ± 0.26 W/m
         <span>2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively). However, this is composed
         of a positive cloud radiative effect from trapped longwave in winter—when the maximum
         Arctic warming occurs—and a negative cloud radiative effect from reflected shortwave
         in the summer, during which season the decreased albedo from sea-ice loss more than
         compensates for the increased cloud reflection. Thus, the warming effect of low clouds
         and sea-ice retreat together more than compensate for the reduction in incoming shortwave
         at the TOA due to enhanced cloud albedo.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The net change in shortwave radiation at the surface is interpreted as the effective
         shortwave absorption due to both cloud and sea-ice changes. Moisture convergence in
         the Arctic is defined as precipitation minus the surface water flux. Changes in Arctic
         sea-ice and cloud fraction are reported as the percent change in the area fraction
         relative to the control simulation. All calculations for the Arctic are defined as
         north of 66.6°.
