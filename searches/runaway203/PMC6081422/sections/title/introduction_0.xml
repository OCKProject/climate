 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic (66.6–90°N) is the region experiencing the most rapid increase in surface temperature in response to global warming

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The amplified climate response in the Arctic makes this region particularly susceptible to tipping points in both physical and ecological systems in the near future, with loss of summer sea ice often argued to be the most imminent

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Arctic warming and sea-ice decline is progressing at rates faster than most models project
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, indicating that there are processes contributing to Arctic amplification that are not being fully captured in the current generation of global climate models.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedbacks underlying Arctic amplification include the ice-albedo feedback, lapse rate, and Plank feedbacks, which lead to less efficient re-radiation to space at high-latitudes, as well as cloud feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, the role of the subpolar extratropics in modulating these feedbacks is not well-understood. Observed warming of the mid-troposphere in the Arctic indicates a role for enhanced atmospheric meridional heat transport in recent Arctic warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, most likely linked to increasing tropical and extratropical ocean temperatures. However, it is unclear which ocean regions may dominate this enhanced heat transport, and therefore exert the greatest influence on Arctic temperature and sea-ice feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decadal-scale modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation have been implicated in Arctic sea-ice variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, indicating patterns of ocean-atmospheric variability may affect Arctic climate differently. Record-breaking Arctic warming and sea-ice decline has ensued in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a, c</a>). Furthermore, sea surface temperature (SST) pattern formation is predicted to be non-stationary in response to changes in radiative forcing, with the most pronounced increase in surface ocean temperatures projected to occur in the North Pacific in the coming decades to centuries (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>); an effect attributed to the shallow mixed layer depth that allows fast equilibration with the atmosphere

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. We refer to this amplified SST response in the North Pacific on decadal to centennial time scales in response to radiative forcing as the ‘North Pacific Rapid Response’ (as distinguished from slower responses that might occur after adjustment of large ice sheets and deep ocean properties). In contrast to the North Pacific Rapid Response, SSTs in the subpolar North Atlantic are predicted to remain lower than global averages in the coming century due to deeper convection and mixing with cool subsurface waters (Fig.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the observed coupling between abrupt Arctic temperature fluctuations and rapid SST changes in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific in the past, and the projected asymmetries in SST patterns in the near future, it is important to disentangle the relative impacts of changes in ocean heat flux sourced from each basin on Arctic temperature and sea ice extent to identify the teleconnections to which the Arctic may be most sensitive. Understanding such remote controls on Arctic climate will not only help to identify mechanisms that may lead to non-linear Arctic climate response in relation to changing SST patterns, but may help to reveal the primary sources of model bias that lead to underestimation of Arctic warming and sea-ice decline.</p>
