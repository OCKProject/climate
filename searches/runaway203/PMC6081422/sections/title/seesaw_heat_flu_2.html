      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the seesaw simulations, the temperature response of the Arctic is dominated by
         the sign of the heat flux imposed on the North Pacific, such that an increase in North
         Pacific heat flux and SST results in an increase in Arctic temperature, despite an
         equivalent heat flux into the ocean imposed on the North Atlantic (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation results in Arctic cooling (−1.88 ± 0.14°C) and sea-ice
         advance (+4.07 ± 0.21% of total ice fraction), as well as a global cooling of −0.39 ± 0.03°C
         relative to the control simulation, despite an initial perturbation of 0 W/m
         <span>2</span> in the global mean. The NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation results in an overall more heterogeneous
         response, with a mean Arctic warming of +0.34 ± 0.22°C and a mean global temperature
         change of −0.03 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation. The difference in the
         magnitude of the Arctic climate impacts between these simulations in part reflects
         the non-linear response to positive and negative ocean heat fluxes. Negative perturbations
         result in a greater temperature response (both globally and in the Arctic) than equivalent
         positive heat flux anomalies, as can be seen in the single-basin positive/negative
         heat flux simulations (Figs. 
         <a>3</a> and 
         <a>4</a>; Table 
         <a>1</a>).

                  The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation (
                  <span>a</span>) prescribes a negative heat flux perturbation in North Pacific (−1 W/m
                  <span>2</span> global) compensated with an equivalent positive North Atlantic Q-flux perturbation
                  (+1 W/m
                  <span>2</span> global), such that the net global energy perturbation is zero. The sign of the heat
                  flux perturbations in the NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation (
                  <span>b</span>) are reversed relative to the NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation. In both simulations, the
                  North Pacific heat flux anomaly dominates the surface air temperature response in
                  the Artic. Gray areas indicate changes not significant at the 95% confidence level
