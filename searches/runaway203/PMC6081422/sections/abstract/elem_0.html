      <p>Arctic amplification is a consequence of surface albedo, cloud, and temperature feedbacks,
         as well as poleward oceanic and atmospheric heat transport. However, the relative
         impact of changes in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and ocean heat flux sourced
         from different regions on Arctic temperatures are not well constrained. We modify
         ocean-to-atmosphere heat fluxes in the North Pacific and North Atlantic in a climate
         model to determine the sensitivity of Arctic temperatures to zonal heterogeneities
         in northern hemisphere SST patterns. Both positive and negative ocean heat flux perturbations
         from the North Pacific result in greater global and Arctic surface air temperature
         anomalies than equivalent magnitude perturbations from the North Atlantic; a response
         we primarily attribute to greater moisture flux from the subpolar extratropics to
         Arctic. Enhanced poleward latent heat and moisture transport drive sea-ice retreat
         and low-cloud formation in the Arctic, amplifying Arctic surface warming through the
         ice-albedo feedback and infrared warming effect of low clouds. Our results imply that
         global climate sensitivity may be dependent on patterns of ocean heat flux in the
         northern hemisphere.
