 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further confirm the above result by two sets of 20-member experiments using a coupled model of intermediate complexity (see “Model description” section in Materials and Methods), under a control [355 parts per million (ppm), constant] and 4× CO
  <sub>2</sub> (1420 ppm) concentration (see “Model experiments” section in Materials and Methods). The 4× CO
  <sub>2</sub> leads to a weakening in the mean vertical temperature gradient of 0.72 K per °C of global warming. In each fully coupled model setting, the observed Atlantic Niño pattern (fig. S1A) is amplified by a factor of 4 to increase a response signal, imposed as an initial condition on the first day of June with an added stochastic noise. We analyze the response to the initial condition in the ensuing year. Aggregated over the 20 experiments, under the control condition, the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection is produced, but under the 4× CO
  <sub>2</sub> condition, the connection weakens markedly, commencing from a much reduced vertical velocity at 600 hPa (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). The result, together with the experiment design in which the Atlantic forcing of the Pacific Ocean is realized by an initial condition, underscores a reduction in the Atlantic memory for ENSO prediction.

   <p>Histograms of 10,000 realizations of the bootstrap method for the Pacific SST response (
    <span class="bold">A</span>) and vertical velocity anomalies at 600 hPa (
    <span class="bold">B</span>) in the initial experiments under control (blue) and 4× CO
    <sub>2</sub> (red) (see “Model experiments” section in Materials and Methods). The Pacific SST response is measured by the area-averaged D0JF1 equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) SST anomalies, and the vertical velocity anomalies at 600 hPa are averaged over the equatorial Atlantic (5°S to 5°N and 45°W to 20°E) during boreal summer (pascals per second; JJA0). The blue and red vertical lines indicate the mean values of 10,000 inter-realizations for the present-day and future periods, respectively. The gray shaded regions indicate the respective doubled SDs (the 95% confidence interval based on normal distribution) of the 10,000 inter-realization (see “Bootstrap test” section in Materials and Methods).
