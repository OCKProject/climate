 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Warming trend of the boreal summer mean (JJA0) air temperature (AirT) over the equatorial Atlantic (5°S to 5°N and 45°W to 20°E) at different levels during 2000–2099. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Intermodel relationship between the change (between future and present-day climates) of boreal summer mean (JJA0) atmospheric stratification and the Pacific SST response. The atmospheric stratification is calculated as the difference between the boreal summer mean (JJA0) temperature at 600 hPa and the temperature at 925 hPa, both averaged over the equatorial Atlantic. The linear fit (solid line) is displayed together with the correlation coefficient 
  <span class="italic">r</span>, slope, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> value from the regression. To enhance the intermodel comparability, we scale both the warming trend in (A) and the changes in (B) by the increase in global mean temperature over the present-day and future periods.
