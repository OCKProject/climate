 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a bootstrap method (

   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>) to examine whether the decreased response of Pacific SST is statistically significant. The 17 sign-dependent average regressions (R_SST hereafter) in the present-day and future climate periods from the 17 selected models were resampled randomly to construct respective 10,000 realizations of mean R_SST values. In this random resampling process, any model can be selected again. The doubled SDs of the 10,000 inter-realizations of mean R_SST for the present-day and future climate periods were 0.03 and 0.056, respectively. The decreased R_SST in the future period (0.091) is greater than the sum of these two doubled SD values (0.086), indicating statistical significance above the 99% confidence level (
