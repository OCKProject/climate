 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied the EOF analysis to the quadratically detrended D0JF1 SST anomalies of equatorial Pacific (15°S to 15°N and 140°E to 80°W) in the 17 selected models, covering the 200-year period (1900–2099). The PC time series was scaled to have an SD of 1. We also made sure that the PC1 and PC2 correspond to the respective positive phase of EOF1 (warm anomaly center in the central eastern Pacific) and EOF2 (a warm anomaly center in the central Pacific and a cool anomaly aside). The temporal variability of the central Pacific–ENSO and eastern Pacific–ENSO (
