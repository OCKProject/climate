 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first conducted two simulations with long integration using CAM3.1-RGO, including a 500-year control run (control) and a 400-year quadrupled CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration run (4× CO
  <sub>2</sub>). The latter starts from the 100th year of control with a sudden quadrupling (1420 ppm) of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration. Then, from the respective equilibrium state of control and 4× CO
  <sub>2</sub>, two sets of initial-value ensemble runs were carried out. For each member of the experiments, the quadrupled Atlantic Niño SST pattern derived from observations (fig. S1A) was initiated over the tropical Atlantic (20°S to 20°N) region on the first day of June and tracked for 1 year within the fully coupled environment. A total of 20-member ensemble experiments were performed for each set, with each member starting from a slightly different initial condition. We also carried out two parallel sets of 20-member ensemble experiments, where zero SST anomalies were initiated. The differences between the corresponding sets of experiments are the responses to the imposed Atlantic Niño SST anomalies. The result confirms a decreased Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection. Further, the system’s memory of the Atlantic’s initial conditions is likely to be weaker in the future.
