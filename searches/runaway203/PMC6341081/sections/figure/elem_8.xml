  <p>Sensitivity of temperature and precipitation to astronomical, ice, and CO
   <sub>2</sub> forcing. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Mean annual temperature (MAT) and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> mean annual precipitation (MAP) responses to precession and obliquity, ice, CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and coupled ice/CO
   <sub>2</sub> forcing. Temperature and precipitation variances are spited into contributions for precession, obliquity, ice, CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and coupled ice and CO
   <sub>2</sub> variation before the MPT (pre-MPT, gray) and after the MPT (post-MPT, blue), respectively. The combined ice/CO
   <sub>2</sub> contribution is not estimated by simply adding up the individual impacts of ice and CO
   <sub>2</sub> because their effects can partly cancel out each other
