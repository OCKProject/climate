  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). The correlation between the δ

  <sub>IC</sub> of surface soil samples and climate variables reveal that while both mean annual temperature and precipitation can affect vegetation growth, mean annual summer precipitation likely plays a dominant role in the vegetation growth over the northwestern CLP. Since temperature and precipitation are strongly coupled over the CLP (i.e., warm–humid in summer and cold–dry in winter), loess δ
