 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentrations of 
  <span class="sup">26</span>Al and 
  <span class="sup">10</span>Be in quartz were derived from the measured isotopic ratios (Methods). 
  <span class="sup">10</span>Be value was adjusted to match the currently accepted value
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, and the 
  <span class="sup">26</span>Al/
  <span class="sup">27</span>Al ratio was normalized to standards
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. For the Jingyuan location (latitude 36.35°N and elevation 2210 m)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>, cosmogenic nuclide production rates were estimated to be 150.42 and 22.09 atoms per gram per year for 
  <span class="sup">26</span>Al and 
  <span class="sup">10</span>Be, respectively. Burial ages were calculated by iteratively solving equations without considering the post-burial cosmogenic nuclide production
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Burial ages of three samples from the same gravel layer vary from 1.62 to 1.87 Ma, with uncertainties of 0.14–0.47 Ma (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The average age of basal gravel layer was estimated to be 1.73 ± 0.13 Ma, which is consistent with the timing of Lanzhou loess sequence on the ninth terrace of the Yellow River
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Integrating the paleomagnetic results and the burial dates suggests that the JY loess sequence accumulated after 1.77 Ma.
