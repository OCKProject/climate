 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use 61 sensitivity experiments designed to sample efficiently changes in the astronomical configurations, CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, and Northern Hemisphere glaciations experienced during the Pleistocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Each experiment is 300-year long and we retained averages over the last 100 years for subsequent analysis. The level of Northern Hemisphere glaciations is represented by one variable called “glaciation index,” and which refers to the 1 of the 11 stages of increasing glaciation sampled from the past glacial–interglacial cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. Level 1 is the Holocene, and level 11 is the Last Glacial Maximum. We note that the configuration choice is such that ice extent grows mainly between stages 1 and 3, while ice thickness growth mainly between levels 3 and 11. Hence, by applying this design to represent ice volume changes during the early Pleistocene, we formulate the hypothesis that area fluctuations of ice sheets before the MPT were similar to after the MPT, but their thickness was smaller.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensitivity of the monsoon climate to the full spectrum of climatic conditions experienced during the Pleistocene is estimated using the climate model HadCM3
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>. The atmospheric component dynamics are resolved on a 3.75° × 2.5° longitude–latitude grid, and the oceanic component has a horizontal resolution of 1.25° × 1.25°. The HadCM3 has been shown to capture well enough the monsoon–ENSO interaction

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span> and natural variability of the summer rainfall over China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. Compared to observations, the summer subtropical anticyclone in HadCM3 is too strong as in many other models. This circulation anomaly tends to induce much rainfall over the maritime continent, but the error in North China turns out to be very small (&lt;1 mm/day) and thus quite acceptable for our purpose.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to generate a forcing-response scenario over the Pleistocene, we scaled the benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O stack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> to estimate the glaciation index over the last 1.7 Myr. CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration over the past 0.8 Ma is obtained from Antarctic records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. The CO
  <sub>2</sub> before the 0.8 Ma was extrapolated to follow a linear relationship between ice volume and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations over the past eight glacial cycles (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). The MAP and MAT values are the estimated equilibrium responses of HadCM3 for forcing conditions spanning the last 1.7 Ma by steps of 1 kyr. Validation for the MAT and MAP over northern China suggests that temperature is overall easier to predict than precipitation changes (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Indeed, the annual precipitation response results from partly compensating trends in winter and summer. Annual changes are therefore smaller than seasonal changes and more difficult to detect over the internal model variability background. Error bars on the variances of the MAT and MAP correspond to the error variance of the emulator estimates. They combine internal model variability, which affects the values of the 100-year long averages used to calibrate the emulator. Uncertainty might come from the fact that we only have a limited number of experiments to map the sensitivity of HadCM3 to continuous changes in input variables.
