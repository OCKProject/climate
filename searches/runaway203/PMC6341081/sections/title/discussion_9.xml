  <sub>IC</sub> records show strong coherence with the precession and obliquity signals, while remarkable glacial–interglacial fluctuations at both the 100- and 41-kyr periodicities started to be highly coupled with the benthic δ

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major differences of these forcing factors across the MPT are the ice extent and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration during glacial maxima
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Thus sensitivity analyses were based on full glacial–interglacial ranges of the ice levels (1–11) and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (180–280 ppmv) after the MPT and half ranges of the ice levels (1–6) and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (220–280 ppmv) before the MPT. Sensitivity results indicate that the MAT is primarily determined by both precession and CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and to a lesser extent by ice, and the MAP is mainly driven by precession and less by ice and CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>). The coupled ice/CO
  <sub>2</sub> impact on the MAT is largely attributed to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> change, whereas their impact on the MAP is a combination of both ice and CO
  <sub>2</sub> changes. Most remarkable differences across the MPT are the decreased sensitivities of both the MAP and MAT to precession forcing and the increased sensitivities of only the MAT to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and coupled ice/CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing. MAT is thus less sensitive to precession forcing after the MPT when the Northern Hemisphere was more glaciated.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different sensitivities of the MAP and MAT changes to precession, ice, and CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing can lead to diverse manifestations in the amplitude and frequency domains across the MPT (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). The simulated MAP over northern China during the last 1.7 Ma shows a persistent 23-kyr periodicity, while the ice/CO
  <sub>2</sub> modulation on the MAP became distinctive during glacial periods after 0.9 Ma. By contrast, the simulated MAT change exhibits relatively warm interglacials during 1.5–0.9 Ma and an increase in glacial–interglacial amplitude after the mid-Brunhes event (~0.42 Ma)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Wavelet spectra of the simulated MAP and MAT reveal a distinctive transition from a dominant 23-kyr periodicity before 1.2 Ma to combined 23- and 100-kyr cycles after 0.7 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Filtered 100- and 23-kyr components in these proxies confirm that the onset of the 100-kyr cycle across the MPT is evident in the loess δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>IC</sub>, and simulated MAT and MAP, while the 23-kyr cycle is less evident in the benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O than other three proxies (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). As the MAT and MAP are two important factors affecting the vegetation growth over the CLP, their frequency changes are imprinted in the δ

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our loess δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>IC</sub> time series, for the first time, illustrate a transition of coupled monsoon–vegetation changes from a dominant 23-kyr periodicity to the combined 23-, 41-, and 100-kyr cycles during the mid-Pleistocene, differing from the well-known MPT from 41- to 100-kyr cycles in most marine-based proxy records. While the MPT was usually associated with an increase in ice volume denoted by addition of 41- and 100-kyr variances in the benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record, sensitivity experiments indicate that the ice impacts on the MAT and MAP over northern China did not vary significantly across the MPT. Rather, the large-amplitude 100-kyr cycle in loess δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C
  <sub>IC</sub> is likely attributed to the amplified effect of glacial–interglacial CO
  <sub>2</sub> changes on the MAT. Proxy-model comparison reveals that the monsoon–vegetation changes responded dominantly to astronomical forcing before the MPT when the ice and CO
  <sub>2</sub> variability was relatively small. After the MPT, however, the precession forcing was attenuated by the coupled ice–CO
  <sub>2</sub> effects. Our results highlight varied roles of insolation and coupled ice/CO
  <sub>2</sub> factors in driving the temperature and hydroclimate changes from the natural past to the anthropogenic future.
