 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the MC-FIT and pollen-based trends—used as MAAT estimates—are in agreement with regional gridded pollen time series (43°N to 49°N and 5°E to 13°E) (

  </a>), showing that the HTM is followed by a cooling trend from 7.8 ka BP onward but with a two to three times smaller amplitude of cooling for MC-FIT (fig. S7A). The MC-FIT record, however, is in contradiction with the general trend inferred for European pollen data (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>). The records indicate strong contrasting MAAT trends with warming in northeastern Europe and Eurasia compared to cooling in central-western Europe until 5.5 ka BP for reasons that still need to be investigated (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). This statement reveals the spatial complexity of temperature patterns in continental Europe (high versus mid-latitude) and therefore would question the significance of overall Europe (and North America) temperature reconstructions, especially regarding the overrepresentation of pollen records from northeastern Europe that would likely be influenced by the ice sheets (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). A process that may be involved in this high-latitude warming trend is the lowering of summer temperatures and a lagged timing of the HTM up to 6 ka BP due to ice sheet forcing (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). The decrease in summer temperatures may then affect the vegetation evolution in boreal region close to the ice sheets.

  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), the Northern Hemisphere multiproxy reconstruction (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), the reconstruction for Greenland (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), the benthic foraminifera from intermediate depths of the North Pacific and Antarctic (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>) and, to a lesser extent, with the slight cooling trend in the mean ocean temperature recorded by noble gases in ice cores from Antarctic (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>) helps to shed light on the influence of seasonal biases. Since the mean ocean temperature obtained by noble gas measurements from ice cores corresponds to a pure physical (solubility), seasonality-unbiased temperature, it acts as an ideal test record. Although only a few measurements have been made so far within the Holocene, this record shows a small temperature decrease despite the influence of the Southern Hemisphere oceans. A similar trend is observed for the Greenland temperature reconstruction (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Figs. 3</a> and 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">4</a>) (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), which is also physically constrained and believed to be seasonally unbiased. It shows a two to three times stronger cooling compared to MC-FIT, which is reasonable due to polar amplification. The SST reconstructions and marine data–dominated reconstructions (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>) could potentially exhibit strong seasonal biases, a possibility supported by the fact that mean alkenones temperatures are higher than Mg/Ca temperatures [see database in (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
