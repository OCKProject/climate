 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MC-FIT record from Switzerland adds new nonbiogenic evidence for the occurrence of an HTM in central Europe and therefore supports the existence of the so-called Holocene temperature conundrum. Our stalagmite data suggest that seasonal biases are unlikely to be the primary cause of the temperature conundrum. The proxy-data records document a significant temperature gradient between central and northeastern Europe, which may affect global temperature reconstruction through data aggregation. Therefore, further modeling and experimental investigations are required to address the observed Holocene temperature gradients across Europe and data-model disagreement, in particular, the combined influence of biases (spatial, time lag, and seasonal) induced by ice sheets in high-latitude temperature reconstructions and climate model simulations.</p>
