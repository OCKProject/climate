 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composite paleotemperature record (MC-FIT) from M6 and M8 stalagmites was reconstructed for 267 samples based on the robust regional water isotope/temperature relationship (

  <span class="sup">18</span>O (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>

  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, we used δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O in modern precipitation and corresponding temperature time series for the GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation) station in Basel (1986–2017) that is most representative for the cave site and the GNIP station in Bern, which offers the longest interval (1971–2017) to estimate short (monthly), seasonal, and long-term δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O/Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> relationships. Seasonal correlations for an individual station such as Bern show the highest degree of covariations with temperature (95%), whereas monthly correlations suffer from strong and long-term correlations from low variability (17%). When pooling many stations, as done for Europe, the long-term correlation increases significantly as documented by (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a linear δD/
  <span class="italic">T</span> TF to calculate paleotemperatures (table S3). Because of the abovementioned consideration in the selection of TF, we reconstructed temperature based on monthly values with a slope of 0.36‰/°C (Basel, 0.35 ‰/°C, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.57; Bern, 0.37 ‰/°C, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.60) and 0.60‰/°C (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = ~0.5) for a spatial relation of long-term trends (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>), as well as on the mean TF of 0.48‰/°C (fig. S6A), the latter being also the mean value for Basel based on MAATs and isotope values (0.47‰/°C, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.17), and the time (number of years)–weighted mean seasonal TF of intervals 1971–1990 (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>) and 1994–2002 (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>) at the Bern station with a value of 0.48‰/°C. The same value was obtained on the basis of a forward modeling method from multiple sites of borehole temperatures in Greenland (
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
   <span class="italic">50</span>
  </a>). These δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values were further transposed in δD values based on the equilibrium fractionation factor of eight. We discuss temperature based on the mean relationship of 0.48‰/°C (i.e., for δD 3.84‰/°C) anchored at the most recent sample (mean depth, 0.9 cm; i.e., 1928–2011 CE) set to 8.3°C, corresponding to the 1928–2011 MAAT for Basel MeteoSwiss station corrected for the elevation of Fahy, that is, 596 m a.s.l. Temperature reconstructions were not possible for the interval of ~127 to 62 years BP (six samples) due to the low amount of water extracted from those samples with correspondingly low confidence in their obtained isotope values. For the YD interval, due to the tortuous shape of laminae in samples, we based the temperature reconstruction only on the three samples from M8 for which we managed to follow the laminae contour most precisely. Other measurements of this time interval likely suffered from mixing of inclusion water from side laminae that smooth the isotope values, as seen on 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>. We intentionally anchored the MC-FIT at the MAAT because of (i) the lack of information regarding temporal changes in the seasonal distribution of water infiltration to the karst and through it and (ii) seasonal water balance values with rather high uncertainties combined with only 3-year records of parallel precipitation and drip water isotope measurements at our sampling site (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Yet, the temperature could also be anchored at a seasonally biased temperature excluding summer based on the seasonally biased water balance values (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). This would just result in constant offsets of the presented mean annual temperatures (see also the “Error estimation and potential biases” section).
