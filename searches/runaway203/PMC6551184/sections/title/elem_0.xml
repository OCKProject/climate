 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long-term evolution of hemispheric and global temperatures during the Holocene remains a subject of controversial discussion [for example, (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>

  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), also known as the Holocene temperature conundrum (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Climate models and new pollen-inferred temperature reconstructions show evidence for lower temperatures during the early Holocene and a continuous warming until approximately 2 ka BP in the Northern Hemisphere (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>), a temperature evolution that is supported by qualitative temperature records from Eurasia (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). The ultimate causes for the Holocene temperature conundrum remain ambiguous, and current explanations range from seasonal biases in marine records (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">

  </a>), underrepresentation of pollen records in earlier temperature reconstructions (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). The first global Holocene temperature reconstruction, for instance, is a stack of 73 temperature records and largely based (~80%) on marine proxy records (alkenones, Mg/Ca ratios, TEX-86) (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). A large proportion of these records are from the North Atlantic realm, leading to the suggestion that the “North Atlantic is the chief source of the temperature conundrum” (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>). Note that the vast majority of quantitative Holocene temperature reconstructions are either based on marine or on terrestrial biological proxies (

  </a>), which, however, are seasonally biased toward the warm season (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). It is therefore necessary to develop more independent and nonbiogenic quantitative temperature reconstructions without major seasonal biases (

  </a>–

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative paleotemperature reconstructions can be obtained from speleothems by analyzing their fluid inclusions (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>

  <sub>fi</sub>) and oxygen (δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub>) isotopes in speleothem fluid inclusion water at high precision, enabling us to calculate paleotemperatures (

Since the beginning of temperature monitoring in 1864, Switzerland has experienced a 1.8°C warming, whereas global temperature has increased only by ~0.85°C, underlining the study site sensitivity to global warming. The chronologies of both stalagmites are based on 53

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reduce uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of calcite and fluid inclusion stable isotope measurements, a comprehensive 2-year monitoring program (2013–2014) was conducted in and above the Milandre Cave (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Present cave air temperatures at the sampling site of stalagmites M6 and M8 are constant and average 9.8° ± 0.2°C that is almost identical to local mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of ~9.6°C above the cave (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). In addition, precipitation events (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 332) were sampled between 2012 and 2014 to determine the main climatic controls on δD
  <sub>p</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>p</sub> in local precipitation and to interpret fluctuations in stalagmite δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub>, δD
  <sub>fi</sub>, and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> values from the Milandre Cave. Temperature changes at the Milandre Cave are representative for central Europe, both with respect to temperature and stable isotopes in precipitation (

  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For calculating paleotemperatures, only Milandre stalagmite δD
  <sub>fi</sub> values were used for the following reasons: First, δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub> values in speleothems from mid-latitudes are influenced by multiple climatic (e.g., surface air and cave air temperatures and evaporation) and nonclimatic (e.g., kinetic isotope fractionation within the cave) processes and are therefore difficult to interpret (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). Second, postdepositional processes can alter the original δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> in fluid inclusion water and thus limit the use of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> for paleotemperature calculations (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). Third, δD
  <sub>fi</sub> is more suited for calculating temperature as it is not affected by isotopic fractionation during calcite precipitation and remains unaltered as there is no hydrogen source once the water is entrapped in the calcite matrix. Furthermore, stalagmite δD
  <sub>fi</sub> values are intrinsically linked to drip water δD (δD
  <sub>dw</sub>) and precipitation δD
  <sub>p</sub>, respectively, where δD
  <sub>p</sub> values above the Milandre Cave are strongly governed by local temperature (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Milandre Cave fluid inclusion temperature (MC-FIT) record is based on δD
  <sub>fi</sub> values by using a linear δD
  <sub>fi</sub>/T transfer function (TF) of 3.84 per mil (‰)/°C (see Materials and Methods for further details) and reflects the MAAT. Before calibration, the Milandre Cave δD
  <sub>fi</sub> record was corrected for changes in global ice volume. The errors in the MC-FIT reconstruction are nonparametric and vary between ±0.3° and ± 0.5°C. The MC-FIT record may be slightly biased toward the cold season based on the current water balance, as the epikarst above the Milandre Cave is predominantly recharged during autumn, winter, and spring (

   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">

    <span class="italic">15</span>

On the MC-FIT time series, the HTM in central Europe lasted from ~9800 to 6400 years BP when MC-FIT was approximately 1.4°C above the preindustrial level (preindustrial level refers to MAAT in Basel between 1755 and 1850). However, the MC-FIT record reveals that the central European HTM was interrupted by a cold episode, lasting from 8800 to 7800 years BP. The 8.2-ka cold event is superimposed on this multicentennial colder period and characterized by an abrupt drop in MC-FIT of 1.2° ± 0.5°C. This temperature pattern is consistent with numerous temperature (and precipitation) records from across the Northern Hemisphere (

Furthermore, for the past 2.5 ka, our record suggests that, for continental mid-latitudes, major volcanic eruptions influenced decadal temperature with MC-FIT minima, coinciding most of the time with major eruptions in Central Europe (fig.

This statement reveals the spatial complexity of temperature patterns in continental Europe (high versus mid-latitude) and therefore would question the significance of overall Europe (and North America) temperature reconstructions, especially regarding the overrepresentation of pollen records from northeastern Europe that would likely be influenced by the ice sheets (

Although only a few measurements have been made so far within the Holocene, this record shows a small temperature decrease despite the influence of the Southern Hemisphere oceans.
