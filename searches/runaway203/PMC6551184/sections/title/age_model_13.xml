 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both samples, the measured ages are in chronological order within their 2σ uncertainty except one age reversal at 56.75 cm in sample M6 (M6_32), which could not be resolved by the statistical program used, and therefore was excluded. Age models were built using the COPRA algorithm (

  </a>). The age model of our record continuously covers the time interval of −62 to 14,705 ± 288 years BP (considering 50 CE to be 0 years BP). More precisely, the calcite of the sample M6 was deposited between −62 and 14,546 ± 155 years BP, and the 1.5- to 13.25-cm depth in sample M8 was deposited between 8352 ± 437 and 14,705 ± 288 years BP. On the interval of 10,985 ± 223 to 14,705 ± 288 years BP, the chronology of M8 sample is more reliable, in terms of dated subsamples and dating precision, compared with the one of the sample M6. To improve the chronology of the M6 calcite on its 135.05- to 145.18-cm depth, we applied an eye-fit “event stratigraphy” using the M8 as “master chronology.” On the basis of the assumption that climatic changes above the cave should be recorded simultaneously by each sample, distinct shifts in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O were tuned within the error intervals of each record using 25 fix points (table S2). To each fix point, we attributed its corresponding 2σ error given by the M8 COPRA chronology. This approach accounted both for the error within M8 chronology and for the one introduced by the temporal resolution of our calcite records (7 years for M6 and 25 years for M8). No significant growth hiatuses have been identified—macroscopic or by dating—on the measured interval. Growth rates range from 0.007 to 0.192 mm/year (overall mean, 0.053 mm/year) in sample M6 and from 0.004 to 0.073 mm/year (overall mean, 0.028 mm/year) in sample M8. Age ranges from the B-A (14,705 ± 288 to 12,715 ± 140 years BP), the YD (12,715 ± 140 to 11,615 ± 40 years BP), to the Holocene (past 11,615 years).
