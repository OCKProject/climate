  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and fig. S4), and both their timing and amplitude are in excellent agreement with other central European δ

   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>) (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, H and I</a>, and fig. S5). Furthermore, the 8.2-ka cold event is also marked and characterized by negative shifts in δ

  <span class="sup">18</span>O

  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, B, E, and F</a>). After the end of the 8.2-ka cold event, a distinct long-term trend toward more negative isotope values is evident in the Milandre Cave δD

  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub> record (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, E and I</a>). This suggests that δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub> is potentially influenced by kinetic fractionation within the cave during calcite precipitation (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). These divergent long-term isotope trends between δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub> and reconstructed δD
  <sub>dw</sub> records were also observed in Holocene stalagmites from the Bunker Cave, Germany (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3J</a>) [(
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>) and references therein]. They found that, despite no δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>c</sub> trend, the parent drip water feeding the stalagmite should have been enriched by ~0.5‰ in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>dw</sub> (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), in line with the ~4‰ measured on Milandre δD
  <sub>fi.</sub> (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, E and J</a>). The hydrogen isotope (δD
  <sub>fi</sub>) values are therefore the most suitable temperature proxy as they witness surface air temperature (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>), as further discussed in the following. This assumption is supported by the close resemblance between the Milandre Cave δD
  <sub>fi</sub> and Greenland ice core δ

  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, B and G</a>), and the comparison also reveals a direct spatial link between water isotope records in high- and mid-latitude areas in the North Atlantic realm.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MC-FIT record reveals that MAATs during the B-A varied around 4.9° ± 0.3°C and then dropped by more than 4.3° ± 0.8°C during the YD when MC-FIT was close or even below 0°C (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). The ~4°C drop in MC-FIT record corresponds with other temperature estimates from Europe [e.g., (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>)]. The termination of the YD cold phase and onset of the early Holocene is marked by a rapid increase in MC-FIT by over 5.4° ± 0.7°C (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a> and fig. S6) within a few decades. The MC-FIT shifts across the B-A, YD, and early Holocene are similar with independent noble gas temperature (NGT) estimates from the Milandre Cave stalagmites (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>) and therefore support the validity of the δD
  <sub>fi</sub> temperature TF used for the development of the MC-FITrecord (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, C</a> and D, fig. S6B, and Materials and Methods). Furthermore, the good comparison between MC-FIT and Milandre Cave NGT estimates indicates that changes in the seasonality of rainfall and storm tracks did not significantly bias the temperature signal in δD
  <sub>p</sub> during the B-A, YD, and Holocene transitions. For the same time interval, we also compared the MC-FIT record with another independent technique based on the temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite and water (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). These temperature estimates are in very good agreement with the MC-FIT record (fig. S6B).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The early Holocene (fig. S7) is characterized by a continuous rise of 1.34° ± 0.16°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in MC-FIT until approximately 9.6 ka BP. The timing and rate of warming is very similar to the increasing sea surface temperature (SST) of 1.32° ± 0.17°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in the Western Mediterranean Sea (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>) (11,620 to 9590 years BP) but significantly lower compared to the temperature increase of 3.73° ± 0.01°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in Greenland (11,620 to 9550 years BP) (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). The lowest Holocene MC-FIT of 5.4° ± 0.4°C occurred at 11,370 ± 150 years BP and corresponded within age uncertainties to the so-called Preboreal Oscillation (also termed as the 11.4-ka event) in Greenland ice cores (11,270 ± 30 years BP) based on the new ice core chronology (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). On the MC-FIT time series, the HTM in central Europe lasted from ~9800 to 6400 years BP when MC-FIT was approximately 1.4°C above the preindustrial level (preindustrial level refers to MAAT in Basel between 1755 and 1850). However, the MC-FIT record reveals that the central European HTM was interrupted by a cold episode, lasting from 8800 to 7800 years BP. The 8.2-ka cold event is superimposed on this multicentennial colder period and characterized by an abrupt drop in MC-FIT of 1.2° ± 0.5°C. This temperature pattern is consistent with numerous temperature (and precipitation) records from across the Northern Hemisphere (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). After the 8.2-ka event, the mean rate of continental long-term gradual cooling (~7800 to 1900 years BP) is −0.12° ± 0.01°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> years with internal centennial- to millennial-scale variations in the order of 0.7°C. The cooling trend for Mediterranean SST is similar (−0.13° ± 0.03°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> of ~0.77°C, 7820 to 1900 years BP), whereas it is −0.18° ± 0.01°C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in Greenland (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> of ~1.06°C, 7800 to 1900 years BP). Moreover, the MC-FIT cooling between ~6400 and ~1900 years BP (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> of ~0.70°C) is similar to the mean Northern Hemisphere cooling based on geological records (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). The past 2500 years are particularly well documented in the Milandre record with alternating cold and warm phases (fig. S8) and display, namely, a marked long-term 0.4°C “Dark ages” cooling trend between 1400 and 1090 years BP and an abrupt Little Ice Age cooling of 1.5° ± 0.5°C starting at 690 years BP, with timing and amplitude similar to those observed in summer temperatures based on the ice-cap growth from Canada-Arctic and Iceland (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). Last, for the interval of 450 years BP to present, a good agreement is observed between the MC-FIT record and reconstructed absolute mean annual temperature for the grid representing the Milandre Cave site (
