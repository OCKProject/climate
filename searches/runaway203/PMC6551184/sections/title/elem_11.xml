  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both samples, the measured ages are in chronological order within their 2σ uncertainty except one age reversal at 56.75 cm in sample M6 (M6_32), which could not be resolved by the statistical program used, and therefore was excluded. Age models were built using the COPRA algorithm (
   <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
    <span class="italic">44</span>
   </a>). The age model of our record continuously covers the time interval of −62 to 14,705 ± 288 years BP (considering 50 CE to be 0 years BP). More precisely, the calcite of the sample M6 was deposited between −62 and 14,546 ± 155 years BP, and the 1.5- to 13.25-cm depth in sample M8 was deposited between 8352 ± 437 and 14,705 ± 288 years BP. On the interval of 10,985 ± 223 to 14,705 ± 288 years BP, the chronology of M8 sample is more reliable, in terms of dated subsamples and dating precision, compared with the one of the sample M6. To improve the chronology of the M6 calcite on its 135.05- to 145.18-cm depth, we applied an eye-fit “event stratigraphy” using the M8 as “master chronology.” On the basis of the assumption that climatic changes above the cave should be recorded simultaneously by each sample, distinct shifts in δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O were tuned within the error intervals of each record using 25 fix points (table S2). To each fix point, we attributed its corresponding 2σ error given by the M8 COPRA chronology. This approach accounted both for the error within M8 chronology and for the one introduced by the temporal resolution of our calcite records (7 years for M6 and 25 years for M8). No significant growth hiatuses have been identified—macroscopic or by dating—on the measured interval. Growth rates range from 0.007 to 0.192 mm/year (overall mean, 0.053 mm/year) in sample M6 and from 0.004 to 0.073 mm/year (overall mean, 0.028 mm/year) in sample M8. Age ranges from the B-A (14,705 ± 288 to 12,715 ± 140 years BP), the YD (12,715 ± 140 to 11,615 ± 40 years BP), to the Holocene (past 11,615 years).

To sum up the measurement procedure, a calcite block was placed in a copper tube connected to the line that was continuously heated to 140°C and crushed using a hydraulic press. The released sample water was instantaneously vaporized and directly flushed with nitrogen gas to a Picarro L2140-i (280 samples) or L1102-i (16 samples) and measured with the CRDS technology without any prior water treatment. We measured a total of 296 calcite blocks that were extracted at the central growth axis of stalagmites M6 and M8 (255 samples, 15 duplicates, and 4 modern for M6; 15 samples and 7 duplicates for M8) with rough dimensions: a length of ~30 mm (perpendicular to the growth axis), a thickness of ~4 to 5 mm (parallel to the growth axis), and a weight between 0.44 and 1.88 g (mean, 1.35 g). Analytical precision of measurements is typically 0.2 and 1.0‰ for δ

   <sub>fi</sub> when using the L1102-i instrument and for released water amounts below 1 μl. Including the natural variations and potential tortuous laminae in all replicate samples, the overall deviation for the duplication of 19 Holocene samples was 0.2‰ for δ

   <sub>fi</sub> (0.0 to 0.7‰) and 0.5‰ for δD
   <sub>fi</sub> (0.0 to 1.6‰). Crushing of calcite samples released up to 7 μl of water (mean, 2.9 μl). The mean temporal resolutions achieved is ~10 years for the last 800 years BP, ~25 years between 800 and 2400 BP, ~50 years until 10,000 BP, and ~70 years after that for M6, whereas M8, which covers mostly the YD, has a lower resolution (77 to 480 years).

    <span class="italic">50</span>
   </a>). These δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O values were further transposed in δD values based on the equilibrium fractionation factor of eight. We discuss temperature based on the mean relationship of 0.48‰/°C (i.e., for δD 3.84‰/°C) anchored at the most recent sample (mean depth, 0.9 cm; i.e., 1928–2011 CE) set to 8.3°C, corresponding to the 1928–2011 MAAT for Basel MeteoSwiss station corrected for the elevation of Fahy, that is, 596 m a.s.l. Temperature reconstructions were not possible for the interval of ~127 to 62 years BP (six samples) due to the low amount of water extracted from those samples with correspondingly low confidence in their obtained isotope values. For the YD interval, due to the tortuous shape of laminae in samples, we based the temperature reconstruction only on the three samples from M8 for which we managed to follow the laminae contour most precisely. Other measurements of this time interval likely suffered from mixing of inclusion water from side laminae that smooth the isotope values, as seen on 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>. We intentionally anchored the MC-FIT at the MAAT because of (i) the lack of information regarding temporal changes in the seasonal distribution of water infiltration to the karst and through it and (ii) seasonal water balance values with rather high uncertainties combined with only 3-year records of parallel precipitation and drip water isotope measurements at our sampling site (
   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
    <span class="italic">15</span>
   </a>). Yet, the temperature could also be anchored at a seasonally biased temperature excluding summer based on the seasonally biased water balance values (
   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
    <span class="italic">15</span>
   </a>). This would just result in constant offsets of the presented mean annual temperatures (see also the “Error estimation and potential biases” section).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed a similar error analysis approach as used recently for temperature reconstruction inferred from ice core measurements (
   <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
    <span class="italic">50</span>
   </a>). Uncertainties for the MC-FIT record come from the isotope measurement error and the error resulting from the selected TF. Uncertainties that encompass hydrogen isotope measurement uncertainty of 1‰ are ±0.21°, ±0.26°, and ± 0.35°C (225 samples) for TFs of 0.60, 0.48, and 0.36‰/°C, respectively (linear regression). It is ±0.31°, ±0.39°, and ±0.52°C (42 samples) for a 1.5‰ measurement uncertainty. The domain error arising from the TF choice is nonlinear and asymmetric and displayed in 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and fig. S6 as upper and lower boundaries (blue-shaded interval) of each single TF temperature reconstruction. Whereas the change in TFs will induce an offset in MC-FIT and result in a change of MC-FIT amplitudes, the variability remains robust and is mainly dependent on measurement uncertainty. Thus, the record moves in the uncertainty band, but the variability will hardly be affected. Errors given in the text for the interval means were calculated with the following formula:

   <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
    <span class="italic">15</span>
   </a>) potentially indicates slightly positive values in summer, implying reduced water infiltration and thus bias toward negative temperature values. If this would be true, then the reconstructed temperature would exhibit an offset of ~−3°C, resulting from autumn, winter, and spring (AWS) water infiltration based on instrumental temperature data. The comparison between the regional CCSM3 model simulations for the MAAT and the AWS for the past 14,000 years also results in a mean offset of ~−3°C. Nevertheless, the assumption is made that the water balance is constant over time. We also have no control on seasonality changes of infiltration and precipitation in the past, and we assume that annual infiltration is fairly constant over time. Potential changes in the large-scale atmospheric pattern, i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation or changes in the moisture source, were not taken into account.
