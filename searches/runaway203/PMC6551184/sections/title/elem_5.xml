 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the initial early Holocene continental warming, a long-term cooling trend starts, which we attribute to decreasing boreal summer insolation forcing (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>) (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). The influence of the high-latitude ice sheets is perceptible in mid-latitudes of Europe, with a seesaw warming until 9.6 ka BP, coinciding not only with the complete disappearance of the Fennoscandia ice sheet (FIS) in Northern Europe at 9.7 ka BP (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) but also with the end of increasing monsoon precipitation (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Between 9.8 and 6.4 ka BP (HTM), central Europe is relatively warm and stable and possibly less affected by the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) that acts mostly on northern Eurasia (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>), with abrupt cooling events resulting from the LIS discharge in North America well imprinted in the events at 11.4, 9.3, and especially 8.2 ka BP. On the MC-FIT records, there is a marked decrease in between 8.8 and 7.8 ka BP and during the 8.2-ka cold event caused by a weakening of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation and reduction in northward heat transport caused by increased flux of meltwater from the LIS into the North Atlantic (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). A longer cold interval from ~9 to ~8 ka BP resulting from a rapid increase of the sea level rise due to LIS meltwater input (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>) induces continental cooling (and reverse) until the influence of the LIS disappeared at around 7.8 ka BP, the latter coinciding again with more stable continental Europe temperatures between ~8 and ~6 ka BP (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). It shows how continental European temperatures were influenced by ice sheet discharge and meltwater during the early and middle Holocene on a multidecadal to multicentennial timescale. Once the FIS disappeared, the LIS continues to act on high-latitude records [Scandinavia (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>), Eurasia (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), and North America (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>)], making the region colder than usual, while mid-latitudes were less affected and highlight the ice sheet’s influence on the occurrence of a Northern Hemisphere HTM (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figs. 1</a> and 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">4</a>). At around 5.5 ka BP and once the LIS disappeared (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), all temperatures—except of the Russian speleothem—follow the same cooling trend until 3 to 2 ka BP, regardless of whether they are of biological or physical nature, whereas climate models show inconsistency with the data (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, for the past 2.5 ka, our record suggests that, for continental mid-latitudes, major volcanic eruptions influenced decadal temperature with MC-FIT minima, coinciding most of the time with major eruptions in Central Europe (fig. S8). This observation is related to what was argued on centennial- to millennial-scale Holocene temperature variability in high latitudes (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). The synchronicity with the new volcanic eruption chronology (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>) documents that for the past 600 years, major eruptions coincide with MC-FIT minima with a coherence of ±7 years. Moreover, the mean MC-FIT cooling anomaly of around 0.4°C is in agreement with a modeled surface temperature decrease of 1.5°C over less than 5 years to volcanic eruptions (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>), considering our sample resolution of 10 to 20 years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MC-FIT record is characterized by an HTM between 9.8 and 6.4 ka BP, although temperatures begin to decline shortly after 7.8 ka BP. The long-term cooling trend toward the present is a distinct feature of the MC-FIT record (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3D</a>) and supported by several other temperature records from the North Atlantic realm. The Bunker Cave NGT record from Germany (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>)—albeit much lower resolved—shows strong evidence for a long-term decline in MAATs during the middle and late Holocene (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>). Moreover, the MC-FIT evolution is regionally coherent with changes in the size of alpine glaciers that showed not only a smaller size than in the late 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century but also no significant glacier expansion between 10.5 and 3.3 ka BP, except during rare brief intervals (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). The MC-FIT cooling trend conforms with Northern Hemisphere and European temperature records such as (i) the Greenland Summit (GISP2) temperatures based on combined nitrogen and argon isotopes (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), (ii) the Mediterranean SST of the south Iberian Margin based on alkenones (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>), and (iii) reconstructed long-term trends of multiproxy mean temperature [e.g., (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>)] (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Figs. 2</a> to 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">4</a> and fig. S7), implying a coherent temperature response in mid-latitude Europe.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a more global scale, in the oceanic domain, an integrated physically based mean ocean temperature using noble gas isotopes shows a slight Holocene cooling trend (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). In the Pacific Ocean, intermediate-depth water temperatures inferred from Mg/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera are linked to the high-latitude source waters (likely related to winter temperatures) and display high values during the HTM and a continuous cooling afterward (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>). The North Atlantic shows a similar pattern (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, the similarity with precipitation proxy records from South America (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>) and the Arabian Peninsula (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>)—itself linked to the Asian monsoon (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>)—highlights together with Pacific and northern Atlantic temperature trends the interdependencies of temperature and precipitation at the Northern Hemisphere scale (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> and fig. S7) and stresses the hemispheric signal recorded in the Milandre Cave.
