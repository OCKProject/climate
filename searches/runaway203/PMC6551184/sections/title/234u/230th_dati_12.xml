 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For uranium-series dating (
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th hereinafter), approximately 170 to 200 mg of calcite powder was drilled along discrete growth horizons (fig. S1). The 
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th ages were determined on a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan Neptune) at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Minnesota. Details of the methods, including standards used for mass fractionation and yield correction, are found elsewhere (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). The chronology of the stalagmites is based on 42 (M6) and 11 (M8) 
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th ages (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1). The samples have low 
  <span class="sup">232</span>Th concentration (between 139 and 5028 parts per trillion) and low 
  <span class="sup">238</span>U concentration (between 63 and 430 parts per billion). All ages are quoted as years before 1950 (BP = 1950).
