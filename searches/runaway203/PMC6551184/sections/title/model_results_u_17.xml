 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TraCE paleoclimate simulation data were provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) that uses a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, i.e., the CCSM3 (

  </a>). The forcing and boundary conditions include orbital parameters, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, ice sheets, paleogeography, and meltwater fluxes. Mean annual surface temperatures obtained from CCSM3 TraCE paleoclimate run were extracted for the area: longitudes 2°E to 12°E and latitudes 45°N to 52°N. Further, Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude (30°N to 60°N) average temperature was obtained using the LOVECLIM model version 1.3. Information about the forcing descriptions can be found in (
