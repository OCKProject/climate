 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Speleothem fluid inclusion water isotopes were analyzed at the Physics Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland, following a recently developed laser cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)–based method (

  <sub>fi</sub>) and hydrogen (δD
  <sub>fi</sub>) isotope ratios are given in per mil (‰) using the standard delta notation and are reported against Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). To sum up the measurement procedure, a calcite block was placed in a copper tube connected to the line that was continuously heated to 140°C and crushed using a hydraulic press. The released sample water was instantaneously vaporized and directly flushed with nitrogen gas to a Picarro L2140-i (280 samples) or L1102-i (16 samples) and measured with the CRDS technology without any prior water treatment. We measured a total of 296 calcite blocks that were extracted at the central growth axis of stalagmites M6 and M8 (255 samples, 15 duplicates, and 4 modern for M6; 15 samples and 7 duplicates for M8) with rough dimensions: a length of ~30 mm (perpendicular to the growth axis), a thickness of ~4 to 5 mm (parallel to the growth axis), and a weight between 0.44 and 1.88 g (mean, 1.35 g). Analytical precision of measurements is typically 0.2 and 1.0‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> and δD
  <sub>fi</sub>, respectively, when using an L2140-i instrument and for water amounts larger than 1 μl, whereas it is 0.4‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> and 1.5‰ for δD
  <sub>fi</sub> when using the L1102-i instrument and for released water amounts below 1 μl. Including the natural variations and potential tortuous laminae in all replicate samples, the overall deviation for the duplication of 19 Holocene samples was 0.2‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>fi</sub> (0.0 to 0.7‰) and 0.5‰ for δD
  <sub>fi</sub> (0.0 to 1.6‰). Crushing of calcite samples released up to 7 μl of water (mean, 2.9 μl). The mean temporal resolutions achieved is ~10 years for the last 800 years BP, ~25 years between 800 and 2400 BP, ~50 years until 10,000 BP, and ~70 years after that for M6, whereas M8, which covers mostly the YD, has a lower resolution (77 to 480 years).

Stalagmite M6 was continuously micromilled at increments of 0.2 mm (from 136.6 to 145.18 cm from the top) and 0.5 mm (0 to 136.6 cm from the top) and stalagmite M8 at increments of 0.5 mm (from 2 to 13.25 cm from the top). Calcite powder δ

  <sub>c</sub> was measured in ~3340 powder samples in both stalagmites (average resolution, 4 years). About 150 to 200 μg of powdered sample was placed in 12-ml vacutainers, flushed with He, and reacted with five drops of 99% P
