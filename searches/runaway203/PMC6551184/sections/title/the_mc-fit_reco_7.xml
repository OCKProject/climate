 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Milandre Cave temperature reconstruction from the Atlantic realm adds new physical and nonbiogenic evidence for the occurrence of a HTM in Europe and consequently for the existence of a Holocene temperature conundrum (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). The temperature conundrum was raised as a data-model discrepancy between proxy records (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>) and model simulations (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>) that was recently extended to a data-data mismatch with the North America and Europe pollen-based (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) and Eurasia speleothem-based (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>) temperature records. The correspondence between the pollen record and model simulations challenges the existence of a temperature conundrum and leaves open the question of seasonal biases (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). Our MC-FIT record is in good agreement with the multiproxy record, which is essentially based on marine records (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), but contrasts with global annual mean pollen-based temperature reconstructions (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) and model simulations (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Using these (dis-)similarities, we address hereafter both data-data and data-model discrepancies essentially in the light of our MC-FIT record.
