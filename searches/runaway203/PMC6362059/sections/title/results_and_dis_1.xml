 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three stalagmites, P09-H1b, P10-H2 and P10-H5, were recovered from Huagapo Cave (11.27°S; 75.79°W) ~3,850 meters above sea level (masl) in the central Peruvian Andes. The samples were taken from three separate locations in the cave, all approximately 1000 to 1200 meters from the main entrance. The samples were cut into halves along the growth axis and polished. For Uranium series radiometric dating, 10, 11 and 16 subsamples, respectively, were taken parallel to growth layers (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> Supplementary Material). For all samples, age dating errors are less than 0.5%. The samples grew from 135,650 y BP to 169,500 y BP (P09-H1b), 146,500 y BP to 177,400 y BP (P10-H5) and 169,550 to 196,600 y BP (P10-H2). All ages are in stratigraphic order and linear interpolation was used to establish age models for each sample (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). For stable oxygen and carbon isotope analysis, 1,707 subsamples were taken at 0.2, 0.5 and 2 millimeter intervals, respectively, along the growth axis yielding an average time resolution of ~50 years for P09-H1b and H10-H2, and ~70 years for H10-H5. Oxygen isotope ratios are reported in per mille relative to the VPDB standard. Total analytical error, based on repeated analyses of standard materials, is 0.08 per mille (‰).

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the oxygen isotope time series for the samples. The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values vary by over 6‰, ranging from −13.15‰ to −19.45‰. Sample H10-H5 overlaps the other two samples for almost the entire period of its growth and there is very good agreement in the isotopic time series from one sample to another except for the period from about 170 ky BP to 180 ky BP where slight age differences in similar patterns of variation appear. These differences, however, are within the errors of the age models. The time series begins at about 195 ky BP (equivalent to the end of MIS 7.1) and continues through MIS 6, the penultimate glacial period, and ending at 135 ky BP, just before the transition to interglacial period MIS5e. Variations in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of speleothem calcite record variations in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of cave drip waters (precipitation) and cave temperature, and may additionally be affected by kinetic isotope fractionation during CO
  <sub>2</sub> degassing or evaporation of water during calcite deposition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The excellent replication of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O in our time series by different stalagmites is a strong indication that kinetic isotope effects and evaporation of drip waters are of minor importance. Changes in cave temperature are surely incorporated into our δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record through the equilibrium fractionation between water and calcite
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. In our record, however, temperature variation would serve to dampen the amplitude of isotopic variability because warm climatic periods, such as equivalent to MIS 7.1, occur when the isotopic time series has the least negative values. Changes in the isotopic composition of seawater could also be incorporated into our record. The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O value of seawater is generally higher during colder periods when more 
  <span class="sup">18</span>O-depleted ice is stored on the continents. Yet, colder periods are when the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values of our speleothems is low, indicating that changes in seawater isotopic composition would, as for temperature, serve to decrease the amplitude of isotopic variability in our record. Thus, we interpret the primary climate signal recorded in our samples to be changes in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of precipitation at the cave site.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variations in the isotopic composition of rainfall in the central Andes are related to climate as follows. The moisture source for precipitation in the central Peruvian Andes is the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Prevailing easterly trade winds during the austral summer carry moisture to and across the Amazon Basin and ultimately into Chaco Low where they are uplifted to the Andes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Today, about 65% of annual rainfall in the central Andes occurs during the austral summer, December-March (DJFM), rainy season. During the SASM, moisture from the tropical Atlantic is transported across the continent before being uplifted to the Andes mountains
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Rainout of the heavy isotope during moisture transport results in isotopically depleted rainfall in the Amazon Basin due to an ‘amount effect’. A more vigorous SASM results in greater rainout of the heavy isotope and more negative δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values in tropical South American rainfall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Because the Amazon Basin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> is source or moisture for the Peruvian Andes, this relationship is also observed in rainfall in the Andes. Thus, precipitation δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O at the study site is strongly anti-correlated to rainfall amount in the Amazon Basin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On orbital timescales an additional factor that might affect precipitation δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O is changing seasonality of precipitation. An increase in the portion of winter precipitation could lead to an increase in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of precipitation independent of changes in SASM. In a modeling study Liu and Battisti
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> found that in the northern Andes changes in the seasonality of precipitation contribute significantly to the total change in precipitation δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O. Their study also found that degree of rainout in the SASM strongly impacts the isotopic composition of precipitation delivered downstream over the Andes in agreement with prior work. It is difficult to quantitatively assess the possible contribution of changes in seasonality to our record, but models of both modern climatological controls on the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of precipitation and those on orbital timescales all indicate that our records are strongly impacted by and record SASM intensity integrated along the path of moisture transport from the eastern Amazon Basin to the Andes

 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first order variations in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values of the record closely parallel summer solar insolation in the Southern Hemisphere, which is dominated by precession in earth’s orbit (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Low δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values, indicative of a stronger SASM and greater precipitation are associated with greater insolation. Increased summer insolation results in increased sensible heating of the land surface, an increased land-sea thermal contrast and intensified monsoonal circulation. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies of the SASM on orbital timescales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Our record is antiphased with records of Northern Hemisphere monsoon records at orbital timescales, which indicates an additional factor leading to increases and decreases in SASM intensity: changes in the mean latitudinal position of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A more southerly mean position of the ITCZ results in greater precipitation during the SASM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. A notable difference exists, however, in the recorded response of Northern Hemisphere versus Southern Hemisphere monsoons to insolation changes. The existing long Northern Hemisphere monsoon records, from the Asian and East Asian Monsoon regions, show a highly nonlinear response to precession driven changes in insolation, with a rectangular step function shape (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) to the records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. In contrast, the SASM shows a nearly linear response to insolation forcing during the last interglacial
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> and, as shown here, during the previous interglacial. A linear response of the monsoons to orbital forcing is predicted by general circulation models and the non-linear response of the EASM has been interpreted as indicating that some additional forcing, such as sea surface temperature or changes in moisture source, must be incorporated into the EASM records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series also shows considerable variability at millennial timescales. To better study these variations we removed the orbital-scale variability by subtracting a 9th order polynomial fit to the data from the original time series. The resultant detrended time series (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) shows a pattern of variations that is very similar in amplitude and style to D/O cycles recognized in Greenland ice cores and many other records from MIS 2–4. In particular, for the period from 160 ky BP to 180 ky BP these cycles show gradually increasing strength of the SASM ended by a sudden decrease in SASM strength, a sawtooth pattern that is suggestive of the D/O cycles of MIS 3 in the Greenland ice cores. In previous work in nearby Pacupahuain Cave, 5 km from Huagapo, δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values of a stalagmite show a pattern of millennial events closely matching those from Greenland ice cores
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> demonstrating that the isotopic values of rainfall in the study area responded strongly to high northern latitude forcing during the Last Interglacial. Cold, stadial, periods recorded in the Greenland ice cores coincide with enhanced precipitation in South America, while Greenland interstadials are dry
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The amplitude of the MIS3 events in Peru, 2 to 2.5‰, is also similar to the amplitude of the MIS6 events found in this study. Thus, we suggest that our detrended isotopic time series is an accurate record of the timing and nature of millennial variability and high northern latitude forcing of climate during MIS 6.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To confirm this relationship, we searched for other well-dated, high-resolution paleoclimate data sets that with which to compare our data. While the best of these, from Chinese speleothems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> and marine records from the Iberian margin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, show some similar millennial variability, none are of sufficient resolution with strong enough chronological control to make a definitive direct comparison. This lack of high-resolution records of millennial variability from previous glacial periods led Barker 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> to construct a synthetic record using Antarctic ice core data. A comparison of our detrended record with the synthetic record of Barker 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. shows a remarkable similarity in the overall pattern (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The timing of individual millennial events varies by up to 1500 y (though generally less) possibly because of the relatively large errors in absolute age control on the Antarctic ice cores on which the Barker 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. reconstruction is based. Yet, the number of high amplitude D/O style cycles and the relative timing and spacing of events is much the same.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One fundamental difference in the nature of millennial events in MIS 3 from MIS 6 is the periodicity. Numerous studies have suggested that D/O events of the last glacial period occur approximately every 1500 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. This frequency is particularly strongly expressed between 13 and 46 kyBP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Bond 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span> found a similar periodicity in ice-rafted debris deposits over the Holocene and concluded that there is a persistent solar influence on climate in the North Atlantic region. While the periodic nature of D/O events has been questioned
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, as has any relationship to solar forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, the concept of a quasi-periodic D/O cycling of around 1500 years persists. We find that the millennial-scale events from MIS 6 are also occur at periodic intervals for a part of our record, but those intervals more that twice as long as observed during MIS3. Spectral analyses of the detrended isotopic time series from MIS 6 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) suggest a dominant periodicity of around 3500 years. Wavelet analysis indicates that this period is significant only between 160 ky BP and 180 ky BP, during which the five largest millennial-scale events in the record are found. We know of no recognized climate forcing at or near this frequency. The lack of any clear external forcing mechanism and the large difference between the time intervals between D/O events in MIS 3 and MIS 6 lead us to suggest that a mechanism tied to ice sheet dynamics, not any external forcing, results in an apparent quasi-periodicity in these records. The differences between MIS 3 and 6 could than be tied to differences in nature of the ice sheets in different glacial periods.
