 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The last glacial period (about 115 to 15 ky BP) is marked by large, abrupt millennial-scale changes in climate that manifest themselves as temperature variability in the high northern latitudes and precipitation variability in the tropics. Termed Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) cycles, these events were first identified in the Greenland ice cores

  </span>. Yet, because the Greenland ice cores do not extend beyond the previous interglacial period the nature of millennial scale climate variability during previous glacial periods remains highly uncertain. A number of marine

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span> have noted the presence of millennial variability during Marine Isotope Stage 6 (135–190 ky BP), but they lack the resolution and/or chronological control for accurate intercomparison or to serve a template for other records. Speleothem records have been particularly valuable in characterizing millennial variability, but speleothem records that cover MIS 6 are rare and those that exist contain little information at the millennial scale. MIS 6 is largely absent from long speleothem records from the Amazon Basin

  </span> are dominated by step-wise response to precessional variability, making extracting millennial variation difficult. Thus, no marine or terrestrial records have been produced with the requisite resolution and chronological control to produce a clear understanding of the number, timing or character of millennial-scale climate events beyond the last glacial period. Here we present a high resolution (~50 y), well-dated record of the orbital and millennial scale variability of the South American Summer Monsoon, derived from speleothems from the Peruvian Andes, that spans much of the penultimate glacial period, from 135 to 195 ky BP.
