 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change in the Arctic occurs almost three times as fast as in the rest of the world [
  <a rid="CIT0001" href="#CIT0001">1</a>]. It profoundly affects ecosystems and is a major driving force for the northward expansion of many species, including vectors and pathogens. A number of infectious diseases have expanded into new geographical areas where they have the potential to become established [
  <a rid="CIT0002" href="#CIT0002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, nine zoonotic infectious diseases were selected by a panel of experts as being potentially climate-sensitive, due to their different routes of transmission. The associated micro-organisms move across borders, and there is, therefore, a need for international collaboration regarding these diseases. This paper aims to show that, although the Nordic countries are closely connected, there are significant differences in the registration of epidemic data historically. Even though efforts have been made to obtain comparable data across borders there is an urgent need to intensify these efforts in order to harmonize infectious disease data.</p>
