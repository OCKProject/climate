  <p>Atmospheric response to the OWBCs: Shading in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">d</span>) represents the wintertime (JFM)-response to SST fronts (i.e., BCF minus NF experiments) for precipitation (mm/day), zonal wind (m/s) at 250 hPa, 950 hPa and 50 hPa, respectively. The contours in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>) show the corresponding BCF-experiment climatology. In (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), the grey, blue and red lines enclose the areas where the local response of BCF-experiment to SST fronts exceeds 20%, 30% and 60% of the BCF-experiment climatological values, respectively. Only significant differences at 95%-level are shaded according to a two-tailed t-test.
