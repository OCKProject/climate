  <p>Dynamics of the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric response to the OWBCs: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span>) represent the wintertime response to SST-front of: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) the baroclinicity (in 1/day), (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) storm-tracks and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) horizontal components of E-vector (vectors, see Method) superposed on the tropospheric zonal wind at 250 hPa (shaded in m/s) and 950 hPa (white contour, in m/s). (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) represents the response of the stratospheric EP-flux (vector, see Method) and its feedback on the zonally averaged zonal wind (shaded in (m/s)/day). In all panels, only significant differences at 95%-level according to a two-tailed t-test are shaded.
