 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All AGCM experiments were integrated for at least 50 years after 3-year spin-up, and the response is defined as the difference in the January-February-March mean between a given front-experiment and the NF experiment. A two-tailed t-test was performed to assess statistical significance of the response. In order to understand the impact of the OWBCs on the variability of the coupled stratosphere/troposphere-system, the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) is extracted as the leading Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) mode of geopotential height north of 20N

  </span>. The NAM-index (NAMI), defined as the corresponding principal component time series, was regressed locally onto various meteorological quantities, in order to assess the impact of the OWBCs on NAM-associated climate variability.
