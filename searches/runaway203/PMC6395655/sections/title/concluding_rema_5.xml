 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent years were marked by considerable progress in understanding the impact of the OWBCs on the atmospheric circulation

  </span>. However, some fundamental questions have not been addressed. In particular, it is still unknown how the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs control simultaneously the planetary-scale stratosphere/troposphere-coupled mean circulation, the NAM and the resulting Northern Hemisphere surface climate variability in observations and standard IPCC model simulations with moderate horizontal resolution. Our semi-idealized experiments show that the OWBCs associated with the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio/Oyashio Currents are important in shaping both the stratospheric and the tropospheric hemisphere-scale circulation and its leading mode of variability. In the troposphere, both Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs maintain the strong westerly Northern Hemisphere eddy-driven polar-front-jets through turbulent heat release with a response projecting on the NAM. This heat release restores and thus maintains the near-surface baroclinicity efficiently against the eddy-induced atmospheric heat transport. This restoration, in turn, is necessary for recurrent storm development and thereby the formation of storm-tracks and the maintenance of the strong westerly eddy-driven polar-front-jets over both the Atlantic and Pacific basins. Both local response and circumpolar inter-basin teleconnection are important for the quasi-annular structure of the westerly eddy-driven jet response to the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs. In the stratosphere, a weaker and warmer polar vortex is attributable mainly to enhanced upward planetary-wave propagation in the presence of the Pacific OWBCs. Regarding the atmospheric variability, the North Pacific and Atlantic OWBCs act to enhance the annular structure of the NAM in the stratosphere/troposphere-coupled system and significantly increase the NAM-impact on surface climate. The NAM- or NAO-like tropospheric response and the maintenance of the stratosphere/troposphere-coupled circulation by OWBCs can also be simulated using zonally symmetric SST-fronts analogous to

In this way, the Northern Hemisphere OWBCs can be seen as an important interface that links the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations and thus contributes in shaping the mean state and variability of the coupled atmosphere/ocean-system. The simulation of realistic SSTs along the OWBCs and reduction of the still existing SST-bias along the NH-OWBCs in climate models

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results can help to understand the first-order dynamical impact of the OWBCs on the planetary-scale circulation and its variability that can be captured by IPCC-class models with standard moderate spatial resolutions. The potential impact of the fine structures in the SST-fronts and ocean eddies requires AGCMs with higher resolution and can thus not be inferred from our study.</p>
