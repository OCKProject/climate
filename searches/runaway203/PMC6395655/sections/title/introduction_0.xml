 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical understanding of the extra-tropical atmospheric impact on the Ocean Western Boundary Currents (OWBCs) has greatly advanced since the classic pioneering works

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. In contrast, the understanding of the impact of Northern Hemisphere (NH) OWBCs on the atmospheric circulation has advanced only recently and has focused mainly on the individual impact of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio/Oyashio Currents on the tropospheric circulation and on small, local and basin scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Compared to the Northern hemisphere, a recent idealized aqua-planet model simulations indicate that Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude SST fronts impact the hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation and its dominant variability

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. For the Northern Hemisphere there is emerging evidence that the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and Kuroshio/Oyashio Currents in the Pacific locally maintain and anchor storm-tracks, precipitation and basin-scale tropospheric circulation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. However, the combined role of the North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs and their individual contributions in maintaining the hemispheric-scale circulation and NAM variability in stratospheric/troposphere-coupled system remains unclear.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been argued that the dynamical coupling with the ocean is not an essential feature of the intrinsic dynamics of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or NAM

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The NAM and NAO exert a big impact on the surface continental climate

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, and the marine and terrestrial ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. It has been established that the NAM and NAO are essentially an internal mode of atmospheric variability governed primarily by interactions between midlatitude westerlies and eddies (synoptic-scale cyclones and anticyclones), as it can be simulated in AGCMs with climatological SSTs prescribed at the lower boundary
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. The coupling to the ocean is therefore not considered essential for the NAM (NAO)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Nonetheless, the coupling to the ocean and hence ocean circulation is very important and largely influences the SST-distributions used in those AGCM-studies. In fact, recent idealized AGCM-studies show that organization of those eddies into storm-tracks is influenced by the SST-fronts along the OWBCs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, which suggests that cyclones and anticyclones recurrently develop where the sharp gradient of near-surface air-temperature is maintained
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. This temperature gradient is directly linked to the SST fronts through turbulent heat fluxes at the ocean surface

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim here is (i) to identify the joint impact of the north Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs on the hemispheric-scale circulation in both troposphere and stratosphere using semi-idealized model experiments and (ii) to clarify the implications for the Northern Hemisphere climate, including energy budget and climate variability. We focus on the features of large-scale circulation that can be largely simulated with stratospheric-resolving IPCC-class models: i.e., the mid-latitude tropospheric eddy-driven jets, stratospheric polar vortex, and associated dynamics and variability. By considering the climatological SST and continents, this work can be seen as an extension of the previous highly idealized aqua-planet studies and the studies with idealized continents

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike its Southern Hemisphere counterpart, the impact of Northern Hemisphere OWBCs on the atmosphere tends to be masked by the corresponding impacts of land-sea thermal contrasts and large–scale orography

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
