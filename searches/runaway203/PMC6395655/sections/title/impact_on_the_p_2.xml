 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the combined impact of the North Pacific and Atlantic OWBCs, we conducted a set of two experiments. The first experiment (BCF-experiment, Method) is conducted using observed climatological SSTs with observed extra-tropical SST-fronts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> only in the North Atlantic and Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). In order to isolate the capability of the Northern Hemisphere OWBCs in reproducing the planetary-scale circulation in the BCF-experiment from other important factors,

 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">we removed the tropical SST-asymmetry, the impact of the sea-ice and the mid-latitude SST-front in the Southern Hemisphere (Method, SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1c</a>). In the second experiment (NF-experiment), the mid-latitude SST-fronts over the Atlantic and Pacific basins are also removed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, Method). The Northern extra-tropical SST-fronts, which represent the regions of highest meridional SST-gradient, form in general as a confluence of cool OWBCs of subpolar gyres (East Greenland/Labrador Currents in the Atlantic and the Oyashio Current in the Pacific that transport cool water southward) with warm OWBCs of subtropical gyres (Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and Kuroshio Current in the Pacific that transport warm tropical water northward). The removal of the SST-fronts can thus be interpreted as reduction of the thermal confluence that results in cooling (warming) along the OWBCs of subtropical (subpolar) gyres (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BCF-experiment is able to reproduce the key features of the large-scale atmospheric circulation seen in the reanalysis, including storm-tracks, tropospheric eddy driven jets, the stratospheric polar night jet and the propagation of synoptic waves patterns (SFigs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). There are however some discrepancies with respect to observations, for example the low-level jet maximum is shifted eastward and somewhat stronger than in the NCEP-reanalysis (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). These are partly related to the semi-idealized surface boundary conditions. For example, the consideration of the tropical SST-asymmetry (Methode, SFigs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) in an additional experiment (BCF_Tro-Experiment), can shift the position of Pacific surface jet and its magnitude more towards the surface jet in the NCEP-reanalysis. Most of the common large-scale atmospheric features shared by the BCF_Trop-Experiment and NCEP-reanalysis are maintained mainly by the Northern Hemisphere SST-front (SFigs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The intermediate resolution used reproduces thus the mean futures of the large-scale atmospheric circulation with discrepancies that are not large compared to those found in other climate models having moderate resolution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. The remaining discrepancies form the NCEP-reanalysis in our experiments can be related to the missing sea-ice, model error, Southern Hemisphere SST-fronts and intermediate resolution used. Thus, we are confident that our experimental design can be useful in understanding key features of winter-time atmospheric circulation simulated by current IPCC-class climate models.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the BCF- and NF-experiment reveal that the North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs exert a noticeable impact on the distribution of precipitation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). Along the Gulf Stream, a well-organized precipitation band is simulated in agreement with
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. This may contribute to maintaining the storm-track
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> and thereby generating planetary waves through latent heat release
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. The impacts of the OWBCs are not confined to the vicinities of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio/Oyashio Currents but extend to the surrounding continents. The associated precipitation change reaches more than 60% of the BCF-experiment climatology over several Northern Hemisphere regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> in contours).

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined impact of the North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs on the wintertime Northern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation is recognized as a planetary-scale strengthening of the westerlies in mid-to-high latitudes and a weakening in lower latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). This response corresponds to poleward shift of the Atlantic and Pacific tropospheric eddy-driven jet streams, with a projection onto the positive NAM in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically the NAO in the Atlantic sector. The presence of the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs has thus an impact on the quasi-annular structure of the tropospheric eddy-driven jets. The associated response can account for more than 90% (60%) of the climatological westerlies in the BCF-experiment at the lower (upper) tropospheric levels (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs jointly act to weaken the planetary-scale wintertime stratospheric polar vortex and surrounding westerlies and thus warm the polar stratosphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> and SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>).
