 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Synoptic-scale baroclinic disturbances play a crucial role in the extra-tropical tropospheric general circulation. These cyclones and anticyclones mediate the impacts of the OWBCs on the atmospheric circulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a-c</a>), consistent with linear wave-theory

  </span>. The sharp SST gradients, associated with the inter-gyre heat confluence, maintain strong lower-tropospheric temperature gradients through their control of sensible and latent heat release from the ocean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a> and SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7a</a>). Consequently, the baroclinicity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, (Method, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), which is proportional (inversely proportional) to the meridional temperature gradient or vertical wind shear (static stability), is also enhanced. The effective contribution of latent heat release to the near-surface baroclinicity has been shown to be weak
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, since condensational heating occurs mostly in the mid-to-upper troposphere in association with cloud-formation. The latent heating can be important for the development of individual storms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. The storm-tracks (defined as regions of large variance of high-pass filtered geopotential height) are thus enhanced along the SST-fronts (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), showing local intensification of poleward eddy heat flux, as a measure of the baroclinic eddy development (Method, SFig.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The enhanced storm-track activity can in turn explain the response of the tropospheric westerlies to the SST-fronts, as diagnosed with the baroclinic wave activity flux called E-vector (Method)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The E-vector is used to diagnose the feedback forcing by baroclinic waves on the background zonal flow. Strong divergence of the E-vector in mid-to-high latitudes and convergence in lower latitudes indicate an enhanced eddy-induced acceleration and deceleration of the westerlies in response to the OWBCs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), respectively. The associated equatorward E-vector corresponds to increased westerly momentum transfer from the subtropical jet into the eddy-driven polar-front-jet (Method), consistently with the stronger (weaker) mid-to-high (lower) latitude westerlies. In the stratosphere, the weakened polar vortex is maintained by the enhanced injection of planetary wave-activity from the troposphere and its convergence in the mid-to-high-latitude stratosphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>)
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall tropospheric adjustment acts to offset the OWBC-maintained baroclinicity (due to turbulent heat fluxes), in which the horizontal atmospheric circulation advects warmer air into the cooler areas and vice versa (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a,b</a>). The transient (mainly synoptic) eddies are thereby the primary contributor to the relaxation of the meridional temperature gradient through their poleward heat transport (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8a–c</a>), which dominates the total meridional temperature advection. The adjustment is also effective indirectly through the zonal temperature advection by the wave-induced mean zonal wind-response (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8d,e</a>). This effect is characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere SST fronts and cannot be realized in the aqua-planet AGCM-experiments

  </span>, which mimic the Southern Hemisphere situation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the zonally averaged framework, the adjustment of the atmosphere to the OWBCs follows the concept of the Bjerknes compensation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c–e</a>, Method). Each SST pattern reflect in general the pattern of the oceanic heat and energy transport that maintains it. Such energy transport can be computed from the energy balance of the Earth-atmosphere system (Method). Removing the sharp SST-gradients is associated with an increase in the oceanic poleward energy transport (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) that is consistent with the warmer high latitude and cooler low-to-mid latitude SSTs, and hence with reduction of the SST gradient along the confluence zone of the OWBCs (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>). The enhanced oceanic energy transport is compensated by a reduction of the atmospheric energy transport under the Bjerknes compensation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, which is accounted for by the reduced poleward transport of sensible heat by transient eddies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d,e</a>). As discussed above, the adjustments of the transient eddies to the SST fronts are manifested largely as the response of synoptic-scale eddies (SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8a,b</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the individual contributions from the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs, we performed two additional experiments with the climatological SST-fronts only in the Atlantic (ACF-experiment) and only in the Pacific (PCF-experiment, Method). Regarding the contributions from the individual ocean basins, the overall strengthening of the tropospheric eddy-driven polar-front jets results from both Pacific and Atlantic OWBCs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a,b</a>, SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9a–f</a>), whereas the overall weakening of the stratospheric polar night-jet results mainly from the Pacific OWBC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c,d</a>, SFig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9g–i</a>). The strengthening of the tropospheric westerlies due to the Pacific OWBCs is not confined to the Pacific but extends into the Atlantic as well as the American and Eurasian continents, in the form of circumpolar teleconnection (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). Although somewhat weaker, a similar inter-basin circumpolar teleconnection is also seen as a response to the Atlantic OWBCs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>).
