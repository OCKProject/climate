The first experiment (BCF-experiment, Method) is conducted using observed climatological SSTs with observed extra-tropical SST-fronts

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">we removed the tropical SST-asymmetry, the impact of the sea-ice and the mid-latitude SST-front in the Southern Hemisphere (Method, SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1c</a>). In the second experiment (NF-experiment), the mid-latitude SST-fronts over the Atlantic and Pacific basins are also removed (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, Method). The Northern extra-tropical SST-fronts, which represent the regions of highest meridional SST-gradient, form in general as a confluence of cool OWBCs of subpolar gyres (East Greenland/Labrador Currents in the Atlantic and the Oyashio Current in the Pacific that transport cool water southward) with warm OWBCs of subtropical gyres (Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and Kuroshio Current in the Pacific that transport warm tropical water northward). The removal of the SST-fronts can thus be interpreted as reduction of the thermal confluence that results in cooling (warming) along the OWBCs of subtropical (subpolar) gyres (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BCF-experiment is able to reproduce the key features of the large-scale atmospheric circulation seen in the reanalysis, including storm-tracks, tropospheric eddy driven jets, the stratospheric polar night jet and the propagation of synoptic waves patterns (SFigs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). There are however some discrepancies with respect to observations, for example the low-level jet maximum is shifted eastward and somewhat stronger than in the NCEP-reanalysis (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). These are partly related to the semi-idealized surface boundary conditions. For example, the consideration of the tropical SST-asymmetry (Methode, SFigs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) in an additional experiment (BCF_Tro-Experiment), can shift the position of Pacific surface jet and its magnitude more towards the surface jet in the NCEP-reanalysis. Most of the common large-scale atmospheric features shared by the BCF_Trop-Experiment and NCEP-reanalysis are maintained mainly by the Northern Hemisphere SST-front (SFigs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The intermediate resolution used reproduces thus the mean futures of the large-scale atmospheric circulation with discrepancies that are not large compared to those found in other climate models having moderate resolution
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. The remaining discrepancies form the NCEP-reanalysis in our experiments can be related to the missing sea-ice, model error, Southern Hemisphere SST-fronts and intermediate resolution used. Thus, we are confident that our experimental design can be useful in understanding key features of winter-time atmospheric circulation simulated by current IPCC-class climate models.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the BCF- and NF-experiment reveal that the North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs exert a noticeable impact on the distribution of precipitation (Fig.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined impact of the North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs on the wintertime Northern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation is recognized as a planetary-scale strengthening of the westerlies in mid-to-high latitudes and a weakening in lower latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). This response corresponds to poleward shift of the Atlantic and Pacific tropospheric eddy-driven jet streams, with a projection onto the positive NAM in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically the NAO in the Atlantic sector. The presence of the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs has thus an impact on the quasi-annular structure of the tropospheric eddy-driven jets. The associated response can account for more than 90% (60%) of the climatological westerlies in the BCF-experiment at the lower (upper) tropospheric levels (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The North Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs jointly act to weaken the planetary-scale wintertime stratospheric polar vortex and surrounding westerlies and thus warm the polar stratosphere (Fig.

   </span>, (Method, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), which is proportional (inversely proportional) to the meridional temperature gradient or vertical wind shear (static stability), is also enhanced. The effective contribution of latent heat release to the near-surface baroclinicity has been shown to be weak
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. The E-vector is used to diagnose the feedback forcing by baroclinic waves on the background zonal flow. Strong divergence of the E-vector in mid-to-high latitudes and convergence in lower latitudes indicate an enhanced eddy-induced acceleration and deceleration of the westerlies in response to the OWBCs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), respectively. The associated equatorward E-vector corresponds to increased westerly momentum transfer from the subtropical jet into the eddy-driven polar-front-jet (Method), consistently with the stronger (weaker) mid-to-high (lower) latitude westerlies. In the stratosphere, the weakened polar vortex is maintained by the enhanced injection of planetary wave-activity from the troposphere and its convergence in the mid-to-high-latitude stratosphere (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>)
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall tropospheric adjustment acts to offset the OWBC-maintained baroclinicity (due to turbulent heat fluxes), in which the horizontal atmospheric circulation advects warmer air into the cooler areas and vice versa (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a,b</a>). The transient (mainly synoptic) eddies are thereby the primary contributor to the relaxation of the meridional temperature gradient through their poleward heat transport (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8a–c</a>), which dominates the total meridional temperature advection. The adjustment is also effective indirectly through the zonal temperature advection by the wave-induced mean zonal wind-response (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8d,e</a>). This effect is characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere SST fronts and cannot be realized in the aqua-planet AGCM-experiments

  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the zonally averaged framework, the adjustment of the atmosphere to the OWBCs follows the concept of the Bjerknes compensation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c–e</a>, Method). Each SST pattern reflect in general the pattern of the oceanic heat and energy transport that maintains it. Such energy transport can be computed from the energy balance of the Earth-atmosphere system (Method). Removing the sharp SST-gradients is associated with an increase in the oceanic poleward energy transport (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) that is consistent with the warmer high latitude and cooler low-to-mid latitude SSTs, and hence with reduction of the SST gradient along the confluence zone of the OWBCs (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>). The enhanced oceanic energy transport is compensated by a reduction of the atmospheric energy transport under the Bjerknes compensation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>, which is accounted for by the reduced poleward transport of sensible heat by transient eddies (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d,e</a>). As discussed above, the adjustments of the transient eddies to the SST fronts are manifested largely as the response of synoptic-scale eddies (SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8a,b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the individual contributions from the Atlantic and Pacific OWBCs, we performed two additional experiments with the climatological SST-fronts only in the Atlantic (ACF-experiment) and only in the Pacific (PCF-experiment, Method). Regarding the contributions from the individual ocean basins, the overall strengthening of the tropospheric eddy-driven polar-front jets results from both Pacific and Atlantic OWBCs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a,b</a>, SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9a–f</a>), whereas the overall weakening of the stratospheric polar night-jet results mainly from the Pacific OWBC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c,d</a>, SFig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9g–i</a>). The strengthening of the tropospheric westerlies due to the Pacific OWBCs is not confined to the Pacific but extends into the Atlantic as well as the American and Eurasian continents, in the form of circumpolar teleconnection (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). Although somewhat weaker, a similar inter-basin circumpolar teleconnection is also seen as a response to the Atlantic OWBCs (Fig.
