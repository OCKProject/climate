  <p>Avoidable excess mortality rate from air pollution. Units: deaths per 1,000 km

   <span class="italic">A</span>) Excess deaths that may be avoided by the phasing out of fossil fuels, and (

   <span class="italic">C</span>) Relative contribution to excess deaths from fossil fuel use compared with all anthropogenic emissions. The dark-blue regions would profit more from removing fossil-fuel-related emissions, while the light-blue ones profit more from removing other pollution sources.
