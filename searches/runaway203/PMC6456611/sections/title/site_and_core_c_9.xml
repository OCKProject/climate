 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice-rich peat cores were collected from a peatland we refer to as DHP174 (65.21°N, 138.32°W; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a–f</a>), situated in the continuous permafrost zone. The peatland is dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> spp. moss, and includes sparse forb and lichen groundcover, and an open canopy of 
  <span class="italic">Picea mariana</span> trees. DHP174 is a soligenous peatland, sustained by precipitation and seasonal runoff from a south-flanking hillslope. There is ~15–20 m of relief across the ~100–150 m peatland surface, measured from the bottom of the hillslope to the northern edge of the peatland

  </span>. The slope ensures continuous drainage of surface and active layer runoff throughout the thaw season, and well-drained conditions in the uppermost 20–30 cm of peat. Saturated conditions during the summer occur below 20–30 cm depth and are maintained by elevated summer precipitation totals (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) and low saturated hydraulic conductivities (e.g. ~ 1 m day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) that are typical below 30 cm depth in northern peat plateaus
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. The DHP174 peatland sits on an alluvial terrace in a valley that drains into Engineer Creek (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and is underlain by permafrost, which limits runoff to the seasonally thawed active layer.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the water isotope analysis presented in this study, we collected two 10 cm diameter core profiles using a portable permafrost drilling system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. The first core profile (DHP174-13, 3.83 m long) is from the ‘undisturbed’ upper surface, and the second core profile (DHP174-13L, 3.32 m long) was collected from an ‘excavated’ lower surface (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>); the cores overlap stratigraphically, and the lower core includes the basal peats and underlying strata. The lower surface was excavated by the highway maintenance authority before 2007 (Google Earth time stamp) to thermally erode the underlying permafrost in order to expand the roadside quarry shown in the satellite images (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d, e</a>). At the time of coring (June 2013), frozen ground was encountered 16 and 24 cm below ground at the upper and lower coring sites, respectively, which are also the starting depths of the cores.
