 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over Holocene and longer timescales, the isotopic composition of seawater is variable. The composite δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> records were corrected for changes in δ
  <sub>seawater</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d–f</a>; see Methods) in order to isolate δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> variability related to changes in climate. The δD
  <sub>pore ice (seawater corrected)</sub> record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) shows a rising trend through the Pleistocene–Holocene transition reaching some of the most enriched values of the early Holocene at ~10 ka cal BP, then a lesser but still positive trend between 10 and 6.6 ka cal BP, followed by an ~6-ka-long negative trend leading to the most depleted values on record in the early CE (~2 ka BP), and last an abrupt trend reversal that began ~150 yr BP and has culminated in the most enriched δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> values at present. It is possible this reversal started before 150 yr BP, but the 1000–150 yr BP portion of our chronology is not well resolved due to the slow peat accumulation during this period, as discussed above. The reason for the slow accumulation is not known but could reflect a local climate limitation to peat growth (e.g. more arid) during the late pre-industrial era.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice (seawater corrected)</sub> record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>) documents similar low- and high-frequency trends, but a more pronounced positive trend during the early Holocene between ~9.2 and 5 ka cal BP. This difference is reflected in the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>), which transitions from high mean values (~4 ‰) at 9.2 ka cal BP to low mean values (~0‰) by 5 ka cal BP. 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> did not change much since the mid-Holocene. Under today’s δ
  <sub>precip</sub> boundary conditions (i.e. as defined by the present-day LMWL), 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> values &gt;4‰ are common during the cold-season months (October–April), and so the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> change in our pore ice record could be interpreted as a change in the precipitation seasonality (e.g. ratio of warm-to-cold-season precipitation) integrated in pore ice; however, this interpretation would also require a constant LMWL, which the co-isotope results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) show is an invalid assumption. A precipitation seasonality mechanism is also unlikely given the active layer hydrology of northern peat plateaus, as discussed above, which precludes snowmelt from the deep active layer where relict pore ice is created. The Holocene 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> trend is attributed to a transition from a paleo-LMWL (with a more positive intercept compared to today) defined by early Holocene relict pore ice (&gt;~9.2 ka cal BP) to the contemporary LWML defined by modern GNIP data, but which aptly describes late Holocene relict pore ice younger than 5  ka BP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Continental boundary conditions such as local orographic effects and mean weather trajectories define the slope of the LWML
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, whereas the intercept of the LMWL (which points to the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> of the first evaporate) is influenced by the mean evaporative boundary conditions at the moisture source
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Given the similar slopes but different intercepts of the paleo vs. modern LMWLs, we conclude that a change in evaporative boundary conditions at the moisture source is the most likely explanation for the Holocene 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> transition.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The

  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> trend could reflect a cooling in North Pacific SST and/or rise in RH in the moisture source region. SST proxies encompassing a large area of the North Pacific broadly agree that SSTs peaked around ~10 ka and cooled by ~1–2 K by the mid-Holocene

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. However, spatial coherence diminishes in the late Holocene with some SST reconstructions, indicating warming and others cooling. The balance of paleo-SST evidence is inconclusive, but hints at a possible and spatially complex relation between 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> and SST.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatively, the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> trend could indicate a geographic shift in the moisture source region with potentially different mean SST or RH at the different localities. The initial timing of the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> trend is coincident with the final collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) from ~11–7 ka BP

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The co-isotope results indicate a transition from one set of δ
  <sub>precip</sub> boundary conditions to another. Although the physical mechanisms behind this transition are not well known, further interrogation of possible changes—such as modified SST or RH at a constant moisture source, or a geographic change in moisture source (e.g. due to altered atmospheric circulation pattern in the summer months)—will benefit from greater replication of the paleo-SST field and isotope-enabled GCM (General Circulation Model) experiments.
