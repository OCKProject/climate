 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic has warmed faster than any other region this past century, owing to climate-cryosphere feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. This warming is driving a range of biotic and abiotic changes that directly impact northern communities and ecosystems

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>, as well as enhanced C fluxes to the atmosphere from thawing permafrost
  <span class="sup">

  </span> and ice loss from glaciers and ice caps
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, which have implications for global climate and sea level, respectively. The broad-reaching effects of Arctic change highlight the need to advance our knowledge of the Arctic system.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current knowledge of the Arctic system is informed by a sparse network of relatively short (~50–100 years) instrumental records. However, the Arctic is transitioning to a warmer state that appears to have no analogue in the historical record. Natural proxy archives (e.g. ice cores and lake sediments) offer an alternative source of data on past climate and environmental change extending back thousands of years, with analogues from the distant past that may be especially relevant for anticipating the form of a future, warmer Arctic

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> broadly agree that the late Holocene was characterised by a long cooling trend that ended with abrupt warming during the industrial era. Many proxy reconstructions agree that industrial-era warming was exceptional in overall rate, but not magnitude in the Holocene context
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, while others suggest that industrial-era warming has been exceptional in both regards
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Differences can be explained by spatial heterogeneity in the climate field or proxy-related noise (e.g. chronological error, secondary climate sensitivities and differences in seasonality). Noise is inherent to all proxies, but recovery of the climate signal can be optimised through replication and a diverse, multi-proxy approach.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastern Beringia, the contiguous area of Yukon and Alaska that was ice free during the last glaciation, is one Arctic borderland where the Holocene climate history is still debated. A review by Kaufman et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> showed that nearly all quantitative, summer-specific temperature reconstructions from Eastern Beringia with early Holocene coverage are based on two proxy types—pollen and midges (Chironomidae) in lake sediments. Regionally, pollen and midges agree there was a climate optimum at ~7–5 ka BP, followed by a long-term cooling. However, these proxies show large differences before 8 ka BP with pollen indicating that early Holocene summers were persistently colder than the Holocene mean (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> range = –3.3 to –0.5 °C; mean Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> = –1.6 °C), and midges showing that early Holocene summers were similar to the Holocene mean (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> range = –0.1 to + 0.4 °C; mean Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> = + 0.1 °C). This discrepancy confounds our understanding of the drivers of early Holocene climate change and highlights the need for independent proxies to resolve this debate.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we present the first full Holocene, quantitative temperature reconstruction from a sequence of relict pore ice in syngenetic permafrost from a soligenous peatland called DHP174 (Dempster Highway Peatland, near 174 km marker) in central Yukon (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), part of Eastern Beringia. Surface peat accumulation is the main driver of permafrost aggradation at this site, which simultaneously archives a warm-season blend of precipitation (integrated as pore water) that reaches the base of the seasonally thawed active layer in the summer. This reconstruction is enabled by a significant positive association between local air temperatures and precipitation isotope ratios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Our pore ice record is conceptually similar to an ice core record in that it preserves a stratigraphic profile of ancient precipitation, but distinct because of its seasonal bias toward summer precipitation and a fractionation that occurs during freezing and causes relict pore ice to be enriched in δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O relative to the initial pore waters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Based on this record, we develop a full Holocene δD

  <span class="italic">T</span> reconstruction, and an abiotic perspective to advance our understanding of early Holocene climate in Eastern Beringia.
