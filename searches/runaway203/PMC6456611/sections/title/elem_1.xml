  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DHP174 peat-sediment composite record (5.32 m composite depth) is the product of two core profiles that overlap stratigraphically and includes three lithostratigraphic units (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) that were deposited over the last ~15.6 ka (see Methods). Unit 1 (5.32–4.78 m) is silty loess and was deposited between 15.6 and 14.3 ka cal BP. Unit 2 (4.78–4.38 m) is a graminoid-rich silty unit that aggraded relatively slowly (~0.1 cm decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span> average) from 14.3 to 11.2 ka cal BP. Unit 2 overlaps with the Younger Dryas interval (~12.9–11.7 ka cal BP), when the climate of northern Alaska was much colder than today

   </span>. Finally, Unit 3 (4.38 m to the surface, 10.5 ka cal BP to present) is primarily 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> moss, reflecting an aggrading peatland phase. The peat sequence accumulated at a relatively stable rate of ~0.4 cm decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, with the exception of higher rates at the time of peatland inception (4.38–4.13 m, ~2 cm decade

   <span class="sup">−1</span>) during the period ~1000–200 cal yr BP.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peat fibres were exceptionally well preserved throughout the profile (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a–c</a>), which suggests a relatively uninterrupted aggradation of permafrost since inception, and a syngenetic origin of relict pore ice in this sequence. Downcore ice content is primarily structureless pore ice (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) representing pore waters that froze in situ
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>. Rare ice lenses (typically &lt;0.5 cm thick; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2b</a>) were encountered in Unit 1 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 7) and Unit 3 (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 2) but were not sampled. Ice lenses represent active layer waters drawn to the freezing front by cryosuction
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>, a process that is common in fine-grained sediments and may explain their higher number in Unit 1. Pore ice and lens ice derive from potentially different active layer water and cannot be directly compared. In this study, we focus exclusively on the dominant form of ice—relict pore ice.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the ~15.6-ka-long peat-sediment chronology described above, the relict pore ice hosted in the same peat-sediment sequence spans the last ~13.6 ka cal BP. The shorter relict pore ice chronology relates to the maximum depth at which active layer pore ice forms and becomes ‘relict’, which equals the maximum active layer thickness (ALT
   <sub>max</sub>). ALT
   <sub>max</sub> is defined as the thickest active layer likely to occur in a given climatic period and is ~58 cm for the study site today (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Because relict pore ice forms below the surface it will always be younger than the host sediments. For example, ca. modern relict ice (–68 cal yr BP; 58 cm below ground) is hosted in fossil peats that grew at the surface ~2065 cal yr BP (i.e. the depositional age of the peats). Relict pore ice in the basal sediments is likewise ~2 ka younger than the depositional age of the hosting sediments (see Methods for full details on the relict pore ice chronology).

For the lower core profile, we consider all pore ice at or below a composite depth of 290 cm (~90 cm below the lower coring surface) to be relict pore ice. The deeper cut-off depth to relict pore ice in the lower core avoids pore ice that has been overprinted by modern waters following disturbance of the lower surface (Supplementary Fig.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. However, water table depth and total latent heat content are unlikely to be spatially homogenous due to variations in microtopography and slope, and therefore the rate of freezing and

  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A warm-season seasonality is also expected for climatological and hydrological reasons. Roughly 65% of the annual precipitation budget is delivered during the thaw season, the bulk of which is rain (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Secondly, the typical active layer hydrology style of raised northern peat plateaus favours a warm-season seasonality. At the time of snowmelt, the active layer is largely undeveloped (e.g. 0–10 cm), which forces meltwaters to drain near the surface where saturated hydraulic conductivity (
   <span class="italic">K</span>
   <sub>s</sub>) is high (10–1000 m day
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0–10 cm depth)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. Conversely, as the active layer thaws in the summer, precipitation percolates to greater depths and will drain slowly due to lower 
   <span class="italic">K</span>
   <sub>s</sub> in the deeper active layer (0.5–5 m day
   <span class="sup">−1</span> below 20 cm)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. This hydrological style favours greater representation of warm-season precipitation in the lower active layer, where pore waters eventually freeze and become relict following permafrost aggradation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we note that the composite record of pore ice (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a>) is characterised by relatively small inter-sample δ
   <sub>pore ice</sub> variability (on average 0.4‰ for δD and 0.1‰ for δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O) in comparison to the large inter-annual (weather-related) variability in δ
   <sub>precip</sub> that is evident in local GNIP records for most months (see δD
   <sub>precip</sub> ± 1
   <span class="italic">σ</span>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The absence of extreme variability in δ
   <sub>pore ice</sub> suggests that each pore ice sample represents a multi-year seasonal blend of precipitation, whereby weather-related fluctuations in δ
   <sub>precip</sub> are attenuated through the mixing of precipitation from several warm-season months, and multiple years facilitated by repeated freeze–thaw cycles. This is logical given the slow peatland aggradation rate (~0.4 cm decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), which dictates that up to ~20–30 years of mostly warm-season precipitation can mix in the lower active layer before the permafrost table aggrades 1 cm, thereby trapping pore ice situated at the former permafrost table as constrained by ALT
   <sub>max</sub>. While ALT
   <sub>max</sub> will not be reached every thaw season (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), it is the infrequent, warmer-than-normal summers that can reanimate and mix with pore ice that froze at intermediate thaw depths (&lt;ALT
   <sub>max</sub>) during prior, cooler summers. Thus, natural averaging of multi-year pore ice in the active layer ensures a climatic timescale integration (depending on the aggradation rate) of δ
   <sub>precip</sub> and representation of cool and warm summers in any given sample of δ
   <sub>pore ice</sub>, which explains the lack of extreme inter-sample δ
   <sub>pore ice</sub> variability noted above.

Differences in magnitude and timing of early-middle Holocene peak warmth between the summer-specific proxies (i.e. pollen, midges and δD

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our reconstruction shows accelerated warming since ~150 cal yr BP, culminating in the warmest summer climate at present, which (based on the last ~1 decade of relict pore ice, or the uppermost 1 cm of relict pore ice) we estimate is 2.1 ± 0.7 °C warmer than the Holocene average or 1.7 ± 0.7 °C warmer than the peak Δ

The last ~100 years of our record is especially well resolved (e.g. sub-decadal for the top 5 cm of relict pore ice) due to the finer pore ice sampling resolution through this interval, and the historic cryptotephra (1912 CE Novarupta-Katmai at 10 cm depth) and post-bomb

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
   </span>. Retreating glaciers on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic have exposed rooted plant fossils with non-finite 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C ages, which indicates that recent climate warming at that locality is unprecedented since the last interglacial
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. While these select examples do not resolve the debate over whether today’s climate is exceptional everywhere in the Holocene context, they do support the idea that the magnitude of early Holocene warming has varied spatially. At our site in easternmost Beringia, the present-day summer climate does appear to be exceptional in the last 13.6 ka cal BP, and our reconstruction suggests that summer temperatures in recent decades have consistently exceeded the Holocene Thermal Maximum since about the mid-20th century.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variability in Holocene summer climate in this region owes to multiple factors. The centroid of the July–August insolation curves and subsequent decline is closely aligned with the low-frequency trend in our reconstruction (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d–f</a>), and implies that summer insolation played an important role in pacing summer temperatures. The importance of insolation in driving Holocene climate in this region is corroborated by numerical climate model simulations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. However, other factors likely had a moderating effect. For example, the flooding of the Bering Strait (as late as 11 ka BP
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
   </span>) and development of thaw lakes in Yukon and Alaska in the early–middle Holocene probably had a regional cooling effect on summer climate
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>, while the LIS collapse and increases in shrub and boreal taxa likely had a warming effect

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. The integration of all relevant forcings and feedbacks likely explains some of the more complex variabilities in early Holocene climate that diverge from a simple insolation-based interpretation. Finally, the industrial-era warming in our record (~2 °C warming over the last century) is coeval with the rapid increase in global

Our finding that today’s summer climate (last ~30 years) exceeds the early–middle Holocene thermal maximum by +1.7 ± 0.7 °C implies that the threshold for ice-rich permafrost stability in this region has already been crossed. This finding is consistent with recent evidence of climate-driven acceleration of thaw slump activity

Continued warming and permafrost degradation in this region threatens to expose vast pools of frozen organic matter in near-surface permafrost to microbial activity and, if released to the global atmosphere as CO
