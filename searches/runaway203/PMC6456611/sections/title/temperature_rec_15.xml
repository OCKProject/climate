 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two types of temperature estimates were made based on the pore ice record—mean temperatures for the modern era (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) and a full Holocene reconstruction of temperature anomalies (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). The first was calculated based on δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> of ca. modern relict pore ice (58–61 cm, uppermost 3 cm of permafrost from the DHP174-13 core), and was used as a line of evidence to validate the proposed summer seasonality of pore ice. Mean temperature estimates depend on the slope (
  <span class="italic">m</span>) and intercept (
  <span class="italic">b</span>) of the δ
  <sub>precip</sub>-temperature regression line, and δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> values corrected for the first ice enrichment effect (ε
  <sub>ice-water</sub>; 5.8‰ and 0.8‰ for δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub>, respectively; Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Uncertainties in the mean temperature estimates take into account the 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span> error in δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> measurements, and 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span> uncertainties in the regression slope and intercept. The general formula used to calculate mean temperatures based on either isotope is: 
  <span class="italic">T</span> = ([δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> ± 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>] –  
  <span class="italic">ε</span>
  <sub>ice-water</sub> – [
  <span class="italic">b</span> ± 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>])/[
  <span class="italic">m</span> ± 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>].

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature anomalies (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>) were reconstructed for the full Holocene based on δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> anomalies (ΔδD
  <sub>pore ice</sub>, relative to Holocene mean) and the δD
  <sub>precip</sub>–temperature slope (
  <span class="italic">m</span>). Since ε
  <sub>ice-water</sub> is assumed to be a constant (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), ΔδD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and ΔδD
  <sub>precip</sub> are equal. The formula used for estimating Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> is: Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> = [ΔδD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> ± 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>]/[
