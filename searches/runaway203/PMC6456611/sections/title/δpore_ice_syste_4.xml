 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relict pore ice is ‘first ice’ (the first ice to form in a bottom-up or top-down freezeback sequence) that once formed at the bottom of a paleo-active layer. First ice is enriched in heavy isotopes relative to the initial pore waters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Based on an analysis of DHP174-13 active layer ice, the enrichment is ~5.8‰ for δD and ~0.8‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, and is not expected to vary significantly through time due to complacent freezeback conditions in a saturated active layer and unchanging peat lithology for most of the record (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). To establish the δ
  <sub>precip</sub> seasonality of ca. modern δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub>, we account for these enrichments to estimate the initial δ
  <sub>pore water</sub>, which can be compared to the δ
  <sub>precip</sub> climatology of the nearest GNIP site at Mayo, Yukon.

  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore water</sub> estimates for the uppermost 3 cm of DHP174-13 relict pore ice (58–61 cm; representing the last ~3 decades of syngenetic permafrost) are −161.5 and −20.2‰, respectively, with a mean 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> value of +0.1‰. Compared to local meteoric waters from Mayo, our δD
  <sub>pore water</sub> estimate is enriched relative to mean annual δD
  <sub>precip</sub> and within range of thaw season (May–September) δD
  <sub>precip</sub> values (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The pore water 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> estimate is also biased toward warm-season precipitation values (i.e. depleted relative to annual precipitation 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> and enriched compared to the warmest months; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). Both comparisons suggest relict pore ice derives mainly from warm-season precipitation. However, a caveat of these comparisons is that the temporal integrations of the Mayo δD
  <sub>precip</sub> record (1985–1989, variable replication depending on month) and ca. modern pore ice (last ~3 decades) are unequal, which may impact how closely they agree. Mayo δD
  <sub>precip</sub> data generally follow expectations of more depleted values during cold winter months and enriched values during warm summer months (as in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), but discrepancies do occur (e.g., peak δD
  <sub>precip</sub> in September, which is not the warmest month), which are likely attributable to the limited replication in the Mayo record. The proposed seasonality of relict pore ice can also be corroborated by comparing δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub>-based temperature estimates (Methods) with the local climatology as constrained by climate data from the Ogilvie River station (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), ~17 km north of the DHP174 site. The average temperature estimate is 6.3 ± 3.4 °C (1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>) based on δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>), and 7.0 ± 3.3 °C (1

  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4c</a>), which are the same within error. Both estimates are bracketed by mean May–September temperatures in the study area and provide further confirmation that relict pore ice derives primarily from warm-season precipitation.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A warm-season seasonality is also expected for climatological and hydrological reasons. Roughly 65% of the annual precipitation budget is delivered during the thaw season, the bulk of which is rain (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Secondly, the typical active layer hydrology style of raised northern peat plateaus favours a warm-season seasonality. At the time of snowmelt, the active layer is largely undeveloped (e.g. 0–10 cm), which forces meltwaters to drain near the surface where saturated hydraulic conductivity (
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>s</sub>) is high (10–1000 m day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 0–10 cm depth)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Conversely, as the active layer thaws in the summer, precipitation percolates to greater depths and will drain slowly due to lower 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>s</sub> in the deeper active layer (0.5–5 m day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> below 20 cm)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. This hydrological style favours greater representation of warm-season precipitation in the lower active layer, where pore waters eventually freeze and become relict following permafrost aggradation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we note that the composite record of pore ice (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a>) is characterised by relatively small inter-sample δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> variability (on average 0.4‰ for δD and 0.1‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O) in comparison to the large inter-annual (weather-related) variability in δ
  <sub>precip</sub> that is evident in local GNIP records for most months (see δD
  <sub>precip</sub> ± 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The absence of extreme variability in δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> suggests that each pore ice sample represents a multi-year seasonal blend of precipitation, whereby weather-related fluctuations in δ
  <sub>precip</sub> are attenuated through the mixing of precipitation from several warm-season months, and multiple years facilitated by repeated freeze–thaw cycles. This is logical given the slow peatland aggradation rate (~0.4 cm decade
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), which dictates that up to ~20–30 years of mostly warm-season precipitation can mix in the lower active layer before the permafrost table aggrades 1 cm, thereby trapping pore ice situated at the former permafrost table as constrained by ALT
  <sub>max</sub>. While ALT
  <sub>max</sub> will not be reached every thaw season (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), it is the infrequent, warmer-than-normal summers that can reanimate and mix with pore ice that froze at intermediate thaw depths (&lt;ALT
  <sub>max</sub>) during prior, cooler summers. Thus, natural averaging of multi-year pore ice in the active layer ensures a climatic timescale integration (depending on the aggradation rate) of δ
  <sub>precip</sub> and representation of cool and warm summers in any given sample of δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub>, which explains the lack of extreme inter-sample δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub> variability noted above.
