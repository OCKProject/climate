  <span class="sup">18</span>O series from the upper and lower core profiles are compared and combined in a composite series in this section. For the upper core, relict pore ice includes all pore ice from depths greater than ALT
  <sub>max</sub> or ~58 cm (i.e. excluding all active layer pore ice). For the lower core profile, we consider all pore ice at or below a composite depth of 290 cm (~90 cm below the lower coring surface) to be relict pore ice. The deeper cut-off depth to relict pore ice in the lower core avoids pore ice that has been overprinted by modern waters following disturbance of the lower surface (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The upper and lower relict pore ice records collectively span the last ~13.6 ka cal BP. The two records show small systematic differences in their mean δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values during the period of overlap from 8.5 to 6.4 ka cal BP (composite depths 380–290 cm), the upper core being relatively depleted compared to the lower core in δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). There is no offset in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> (
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>excess</sub> = δD – 8 × δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) The δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O differences are small in absolute terms (the mean offsets are 1.35‰ and 0.22‰ for δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, respectively) and are not unexpected for different sites across a landscape given the same source water. As we discuss below, relict pore ice is enriched in heavy isotopologues relative to the initial pore waters due a fractionation that occurs during the freezing process
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. The overall enrichment (
  <span class="italic">ε</span>
  <sub>ice-water</sub>) depends on the rates of freezing and molecular diffusivity. For our site, the lower active layer is saturated in the late summer and, thus, the rate of freezing will be buffered by latent heat effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. However, water table depth and total latent heat content are unlikely to be spatially homogenous due to variations in microtopography and slope, and therefore the rate of freezing and 
  <span class="italic">ε</span>
  <sub>ice-water</sub> are also unlikely to be homogenous. Because the two core locations (~50 m apart) receive the same precipitation and runoff, spatial variability in 
  <span class="italic">ε</span>
  <sub>ice-water</sub> is a probable explanation for the small offsets in δ
  <sub>pore ice</sub>.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of origin, the offsets are systematic and the cores show coherent variations at 10

  <span class="sup">3</span> year timescales (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>), which suggests that both cores are in fact archiving the same source water. To enable a direct comparison of the two series in a composite record, we adjusted the upper core δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> series by adding a constant equal to half of the mean δD and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O offsets, and the lower core δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O

  <span class="sup">18</span>O offsets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). This aligns both series to a common mean value during their period of overlap without modifying the individual trends, and, thus, the composite δD

  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> records (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a>) also accurately depict the raw δ

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composite record covers the last ~13.6 ka with an average time-step of ~158 years between pore ice samples since 10.5 ka cal BP; however, from 13.6–10.5 ka cal BP, the average time-step is relatively coarse (~1020 years between samples) due to low accumulation rates just prior to the peatland initiation.</p>
