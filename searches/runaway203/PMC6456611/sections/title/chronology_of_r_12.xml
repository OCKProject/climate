 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meteoric waters that reach the maximum thaw depth of ~58 cm (see maximum active layer thickness or ALT
  <sub>max</sub> in Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) will eventually freeze in situ as pore ice during the fall freezeback and become ‘relict’ as permafrost aggradation occurs. Since permafrost aggradation is paced by the accumulation of materials at the surface (peat or sediment), the age of relict pore ice at any given depth below the permafrost table can be referenced from the peat-sediment age-depth model by accounting for the 58 cm offset between relict pore ice and its contemporaneous surface. For example, ca. modern relict pore ice at 58 cm composite depth is age-equivalent to the modern surface (i.e. –63 cal yr BP in the age-depth model); likewise, relict pore ice at 530 cm composite depth is age-equivalent to a paleosurface at a composite depth of 472 cm (13,585 cal yr BP in our age-depth model). We assume a static ALT
  <sub>max</sub> of 58 cm through time. Although ALT
  <sub>max</sub> potentially did vary throughout the Holocene due to changes in summer climate, it likely remained within 3–6 cm of the modern ALT
  <sub>max</sub> value and does not significantly influence our pore ice chronology or conclusions (Supplementary Note
