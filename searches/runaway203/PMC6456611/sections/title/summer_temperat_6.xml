  <sub>precip</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). However, if the modern δ
  <sub>precip</sub>-temperature transfer functions (both of which are linear) were applied to the δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>pore ice</sub> records, they would yield different reconstructions given their contrasting trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a>)—and clearly both cannot be correct. As evidenced by the early to late Holocene LMWL transition (as discussed above), δ
  <sub>precip</sub> boundary conditions did change and were likely driven by changes in evaporative conditions at the moisture source. The slow-moving H
  <sub>2</sub>
  <span class="sup">18</span>O isotopologue is especially sensitive to non-equilibrium effects driven by changes in evaporation rate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. By comparison, HDO is relatively insensitive to this effect. For that reason, we consider δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub> to be a potentially more reliable local temperature proxy and use it as the basis for our Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomaly reconstruction (see Methods).
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> reconstruction (expressed as anomalies w.r.t. Holocene mean; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>) shows a strong warming trend during the Pleistocene–Holocene transition, and variable Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomalies ranging from –0.5 to +0.5 °C during the early Holocene (10.4–9.6 ka cal BP) with a mean Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> of +0.1 °C. Local summer Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> reconstructions from pollen and midges show major differences during this interval, with pollen indicating cool Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> values from –2.2 to –1.2 °C, and midges indicating warm values from +0.1 to +0.4 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). This difference may be due to limitations of the modern analogue technique (MAT), which is the quantitative method used to estimate summer temperatures from the E. Beringian pollen records. As discussed by Kaufman et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, it is notable that qualitative interpretations based on pollen in this region have reached the opposite conclusion that the early Holocene was warm. A warm climate is also indicated by a diverse suite of qualitative proxy evidence in E. Beringia, including high frequencies of thaw lake and peatland initiation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>; a multi-proxy ‘all-temperature’ composite record that depicts the dominant mode of variability of all-temperature-sensitive marine and terrestrial records (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>); and warmer SSTs as discussed above. However, not all of these supporting proxies are necessarily sensitive to summer temperatures exclusively. Last, a brief thermal maximum at ~10 ka cal BP is also evident in a multi-proxy temperature record representing the northern extratropics (30–90°N) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), suggesting this phase of early Holocene warmth was widespread. The balance of evidence favours a warm early Holocene. It remains unclear why MAT-based interpretations of pollen in this region, on average, suggest colder summers. Further studies are needed to understand this discrepancy, especially given the popular use of pollen data in Quaternary studies.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 9.6 to 6.6 ka cal BP, our reconstruction shows a sustained warming with Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomalies ranging from –0.1 to +0.4 °C, and an average Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> of 0.2 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Local maxima in Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> occur at 9.6 ka cal BP (+0.4 °C), 8.8 ka cal BP (+0.4 °C), 7.6 ka cal BP (+0.4 °C) and 6.8–6.6 ka cal BP (+0.3 °C). Individual Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomalies should not be over-interpreted; however, it is notable that the +0.4 °C anomaly at 8.8  ka cal BP coincides with a deep thaw unconformity preserved in permafrost near Mayo, which is dated to 8.87 ± 0.2 ka BP and has been linked to a brief period of exceptionally warm conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. We also note that the later warm interval between 7.6 and 6.6 ka cal BP coincides with a period of Arctic treeline expansion in the Mackenzie Delta region (~400 km N.E. of DHP174) that began ~8 ka BP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The 7.6–6.6 ka cal BP warm interval also matches a thermal maximum in the extratropical composite (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). The E. Beringia ‘all-temperature’ composite shows a slightly later thermal maximum at ~6.5–6.0 ka BP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). The regional pollen composite shows warm summers (+0.47 °C) from 7.5 to 7.0 ka BP (comparable to the pore ice Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomaly at ~7.6 ka BP), but slightly warmer summers (+0.55 °C) from 6.0 to 5.5 ka BP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). Similarly, the midge composite shows warm summers (+0.19 °C) from 7.5 to 6.5 ka BP, but even warmer summers (+0.34 °C) from 6.0 to 5.5 ka BP. Differences in magnitude and timing of early-middle Holocene peak warmth between the summer-specific proxies (i.e. pollen, midges and δD
  <sub>pore ice</sub>) are relatively small, and to some extent are likely explained by the unequal spatial representation of the different records. Additional pore ice records across the region may improve inter-proxy coherence.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 6.6 to 1.2 ka cal BP, our reconstruction shows a long-term cooling trend of –0.16 °C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 6.82 × 10
  <span class="sup">–5</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Prominent cooling trends over the same interval are documented in the E. Beringia multi-proxy composite and extratropical multi-proxy composite (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a, b</a>). The extratropical composite shows a cooling trend of the same magnitude (–0.17 °C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) between 6.6 and 1.2 ka BP. Regional pollen and midge composites also show cooling trends through this interval, but at lesser rates of change (–0.04 and –0.05 °C ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). Differences in cooling rates between the records may be explained by seasonality or spatial (e.g. continentality) inequities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From ~1200 to 150 cal yr BP our reconstruction shows a gradual warming trend. A similar warming trend over the last ~1–2 ka is observed in the E. Beringia all-temperature composite (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). However, a warming trend during this interval is relatively uncommon to CE temperature reconstructions globally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, and is not supported by the multi-proxy composites from 30 to 90°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) and 60 to 90°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>), which show a cooling trend during this time. Due to the slow peat accumulation rates from ~1000 to 150 cal yr BP (~0.1 cm ka
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), the late pre-industrial era is not well resolved in our pore ice record; therefore, our reconstruction should not be used for detailed estimates of temperature change during this interval.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our reconstruction shows accelerated warming since ~150 cal yr BP, culminating in the warmest summer climate at present, which (based on the last ~1 decade of relict pore ice, or the uppermost 1 cm of relict pore ice) we estimate is 2.1 ± 0.7 °C warmer than the Holocene average or 1.7 ± 0.7 °C warmer than the peak Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomalies during the early-middle Holocene thermal maximum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). The average ∆
  <span class="italic">T</span> anomaly for the last ~30 years of relict pore ice (uppermost 5 cm of relict pore ice) is +1.9 ± 0.7 °C warmer than the Holocene mean. The last ~100 years of our record is especially well resolved (e.g. sub-decadal for the top 5 cm of relict pore ice) due to the finer pore ice sampling resolution through this interval, and the historic cryptotephra (1912 CE Novarupta-Katmai at 10 cm depth) and post-bomb 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C dating (−35 cal yr BP at 4–5 cm depth) that constrain this part of the chronology (Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Our reconstruction shows ~2 °C of warming over the last 100 years, which matches the overall increase in observed May–September temperature anomalies from this region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Similar warming rates are evident in the extratropical and Arctic composites (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–e</a>), and temperature estimates from the Agassiz ice core ‘melt’ record, Ellesmere Island
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. However, the magnitude of warming in the industrial era vs. early Holocene is still debated. The extratropical multi-proxy composite suggests the modern climate has not yet exceeded early Holocene peak warmth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, while some land-only (North America and Europe) pollen-based temperature reconstructions suggest the last decade was ~1.2 °C warmer than the Holocene mean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Retreating glaciers on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic have exposed rooted plant fossils with non-finite 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C ages, which indicates that recent climate warming at that locality is unprecedented since the last interglacial
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. While these select examples do not resolve the debate over whether today’s climate is exceptional everywhere in the Holocene context, they do support the idea that the magnitude of early Holocene warming has varied spatially. At our site in easternmost Beringia, the present-day summer climate does appear to be exceptional in the last 13.6 ka cal BP, and our reconstruction suggests that summer temperatures in recent decades have consistently exceeded the Holocene Thermal Maximum since about the mid-20th century.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variability in Holocene summer climate in this region owes to multiple factors. The centroid of the July–August insolation curves and subsequent decline is closely aligned with the low-frequency trend in our reconstruction (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d–f</a>), and implies that summer insolation played an important role in pacing summer temperatures. The importance of insolation in driving Holocene climate in this region is corroborated by numerical climate model simulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. However, other factors likely had a moderating effect. For example, the flooding of the Bering Strait (as late as 11 ka BP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>) and development of thaw lakes in Yukon and Alaska in the early–middle Holocene probably had a regional cooling effect on summer climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, while the LIS collapse and increases in shrub and boreal taxa likely had a warming effect
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. The integration of all relevant forcings and feedbacks likely explains some of the more complex variabilities in early Holocene climate that diverge from a simple insolation-based interpretation. Finally, the industrial-era warming in our record (~2 °C warming over the last century) is coeval with the rapid increase in global 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5g</a>), which is an important driver of 20th century warming at the global scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. In addition to the 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing, Arctic warming is amplified above the global average due to reductions in sea ice concentrations, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (north of Alaska)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, which likely accounts for at least part of the 20th century warming trend in our record.
