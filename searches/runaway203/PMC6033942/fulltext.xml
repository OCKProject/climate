The close of MIS19c (~777,000 years ago) thus serves as a proxy for a contemporary climate system unaffected by humans. Our global climate model simulation driven by orbital parameters and observed greenhouse gas concentrations at the end of MIS19c is 1.3&#x02009;K colder than the reference pre-industrial climate of the late Holocene (year 1850). Much stronger cooling occurs in the Arctic, where sea ice and year-round snow cover expand considerably. Inferred regions of glaciation develop across northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the Canadian Archipelago. These locations are consistent with evidence from past glacial inceptions and are favored by atmospheric circulation changes that reduce ablation of snow cover and increase accumulation of snowfall. Particularly large buildups of snow depth coincide with presumed glacial nucleation sites, including Baffin Island and the northeast Canadian Archipelago. These findings suggest that present-day climate would be susceptible to glacial inception if greenhouse gas concentrations were as low as they were at the end of MIS 19c.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000085</institution-id><institution>NSF | Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AGS-1203430, AGS-1203965, AGS-1602771, AGS-1602967</award-id><award-id>AGS-1203430, AGS-1203965, AGS-1602771, AGS-1602967</award-id><award-id>AGS-1203430, AGS-1203965, AGS-1602771, AGS-1602967</award-id><award-id>AGS-1203430, AGS-1203965, AGS-1602771, AGS-1602967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vavrus</surname><given-names>Stephen J.</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Kutzbach</surname><given-names>John E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruddiman</surname><given-names>William F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/I025115/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzedakis</surname><given-names>Polychronis C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">We present a global climate model simulation, using the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4, see Methods), run on the interglaciation during Marine Isotope Stage 19c (MIS19)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> to provide a ground-truth analog for a contemporary climate system not affected by human activities.

The model simulated a buildup of large-scale ice volume at the close of MIS19, whereas glaciation during MIS1 depended critically on whether Holocene CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations followed an inferred natural trajectory to 240 ppm (slightly lower than our estimate) or the actual trajectory of 280&#x02013;285 ppm by the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p id="Par5">This paper also investigates the onset of glaciation in MIS19 but does so using a much higher-resolution global climate model (GCM) simulation that represents circulation patterns, energy transport, and hydrologic processes much more realistically than an EMIC.

Our CCSM4 GCM experiment of MIS19 informs whether contemporary climate conditions are suitable for glacial inception under the much lower GHG concentrations estimated in the absence of both ancient and recent carbon emissions from agriculture and industrialization.</p><p id="Par6">Reconstructions of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations from ice core records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> at Antarctic Dome C, using the EDC3 chronology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, can be compared between MIS19 and MIS1. The MIS19 CO<sub>2</sub> trend reached an early peak of 269 ppm, essentially identical to the peak of 270 ppm early in MIS1, after which both trends started falling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The MIS19 trend continued declining through the time of the modern-day equivalent (777,000 years ago), but the MIS1 trend reversed direction 7000&#x02013;8000 years ago and rose for the remainder of the Holocene. These opposing trends are consistent with the prediction from the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis (EAH) that MIS1 values would have continued falling if not for early agriculture, as they did in other recent interglacials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The 245-ppm CO<sub>2</sub> concentration estimated as the modern-day equivalent in MIS19 (see Methods) is very close to the interpolated 248 ppm value from the latest Dome C data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and lies at the top of our previously estimated 240&#x02013;245 ppm range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The difference in CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing between 245 ppm and 248 ppm amounts to only 0.06&#x02009;W&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and thus should have a minor effect on the model simulation.</p><p id="Par7">CH<sub>4</sub> in MIS19 reached an early-interglacial peak of 739 ppb, compared with the 717-ppb peak early in MIS1, after which both trends began falling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The MIS19 concentration then dropped to a value of 631 ppb by the time of the modern-day equivalent at 777 ka, interrupted by a brief CH<sub>4</sub> maximum near 778 ka that is interpreted as a millennial-scale oscillation because it was defined by two data points separated by just a little over 1000 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The CH<sub>4</sub> trend then resumed its gradual orbital-scale downward trend through (and beyond) the time of the modern-day equivalent, dropping to 530 ppb by around 772 ka (not shown). In contrast, the MIS1 CH<sub>4</sub> trend reversed direction 5000 years ago and has moved steadily upward since then, reaching around 790 ppb just before the industrial greenhouse-gas era began in 1850. These opposing directions (down for MIS19, up for MIS1) are again consistent with the EAH prediction. In this case, however, the MIS19 CH<sub>4</sub> trend remained higher than the downward path of the MIS1 trend proposed in the EAH, based on the average trend of many recent interglaciations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and estimated Holocene emissions arising from plant and animal domestication (see Methods), but the effect of this difference on radiative forcing is small compared with the influence of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par8">Ideally, the contemporary &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the absence of all anthropogenic carbon emissions would be derived from an interactive carbon cycle model with an accompanying dynamical vegetation model. Unfortunately, neither of these modules is up to the task. Coupled carbon cycle models in GCMs are unreliable in their simulations of the observed industrial-era rise in CO<sub>2</sub>, producing a 45 ppm spread in near-present-day concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which is about twice as large as the pre-industrial CO<sub>2</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene that we are studying. Interactive global vegetation models in GCMs often produce unrealistic distributions of grasses and trees in the present-day climate, highly divergent future vegetation distributions even for the same climatic forcing scenario, and a large spread in their carbon-climate feedback parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These modeling inadequacies necessitate the use of prescribed estimates of GHG concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par9">We employed the CCSM4 GCM (see Methods) to test whether glacial inception is simulated for the Stage 19 equivalent of the present day at 777 ka (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), noting that the two largest forcings&#x02013;insolation and CO<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;are very close analogs to those proposed in the EAH. The negative greenhouse forcing in MIS19, relative to pre-industrial &#x0201c;PI&#x0201d; conditions at year 1850, causes a much colder climate. The mean-annual global temperature falls by 1.27&#x02009;K, while the 5&#x02013;6&#x02009;K cooling in the high Arctic is the most pronounced anywhere (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Polar temperatures drop the most over sea ice and along adjacent Arctic land, including Alaska and Baffin Island. High-latitude cooling during summer is especially important for promoting glaciations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and the MIS19 simulation produces substantial and widespread summertime temperature decreases of over 3&#x02009;K across much of the Arctic, especially over northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the Canadian archipelago (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Accompanying this terrestrial cooling is a comparable temperature decrease over the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, where a pronounced expansion of sea ice occurs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The cooling in the North Atlantic versus the North Pacific is presumably enhanced by the response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which weakens by 2&#x02009;Sv (25.5&#x02009;Sv to 23.5&#x02009;Sv) in MIS19.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Changes in surface temperature (K) and sea ice coverage (%) between MIS19 and PI.

One way to identify year-round snow cover is to apply the 5% grid-box snow concentration threshold (see Methods) to the PI and MIS19 simulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Based on this definition, much more permanent snow cover emerges in MIS19, especially in Siberia, Alaska, and the Canadian Northwest Territories. Overall, snow cover persisting throughout the year encompasses 9.92 million km<sup>2</sup> in MIS19, compared with 5.99 million km<sup>2</sup> in PI, representing a 66% increase (92% expansion excluding Greenland). Topography exerts a strong influence on where permanent snow cover forms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), particularly in the PI simulation, as highly elevated regions are the preferred sites in Siberia and Alaska (Brooks Range and coastal Alaska Range). Elevation plays a less obvious role in the MIS19 run, which is cold enough to support a year-round snow pack even at lower altitudes. We assume that these regions of year-round snow cover would eventually become land ice if the model included glacial processes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Regions with a year-round snow pack in (<bold>a</bold>) PI and (<bold>b</bold>) MIS19, based on August snow cover of at least 5% in a gridbox.

Many of these locations are regarded as initial nucleation sites for marine ice sheets that developed over the Barents and Kara Seas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Over Baffin Island and the Archipelago, reduced ablation is promoted by the development of a summertime high-pressure anomaly centered over the broader Greenland area that extends across much of the Arctic Ocean and into Siberia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This anomalous anticyclone is fostered by the strong surface cooling of the ocean surrounding Greenland (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), which in turn is caused by the combination of a weakened AMOC and expanded sea ice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This ice expansion results in a pronounced spread of sub-freezing surface conditions during summer in the North Atlantic-Labrador Sea region, approximately delineated by where sea ice cover expands by at least 15%. A consequence of the anomalous high pressure around Greenland is a change in the lower-atmospheric wind field (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This results in enhanced flow over the much-colder ocean surrounding Greenland and onto Baffin Island, where the most pronounced emergence of maximum snow thickness occurs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The circulation change over the Arctic Ocean also favors less ablation over Siberia, due to the weaker but consistently onshore flow coming from the Arctic Ocean.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Changes between MIS19 and PI simulations.

The large increase of annual snowfall over this region matches well with the appearance of permanent snow cover (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A similar type of circulation change also favors the increase of snowfall over the mountains of Norway, where a few grid cells become permanently snow covered in MIS19.

Present-day orbital forcing is virtually the same as in MIS19, and contemporary GHG forcing would be virtually equivalent to MIS19&#x02019;s if the Holocene climate had followed the expected late-interglacial GHG decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In that case, our present-day natural climate should be approximately the same as MIS19&#x02019;s, including glacial inception.

Removing the CO<sub>2</sub> contribution from industrialization lowers the contemporary concentration to 285 ppm, which therefore serves as an absolute upper limit for a natural present-day. This CO<sub>2</sub> value was preceded, however, by rising concentrations since 8000 years ago, when the concentration had fallen to 260 ppm. Because CO<sub>2</sub> levels in all recent, comparable interglaciations identified by ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. (MIS 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, and 19) declined during their final eight millennia (up to their insolation minimum), an expected present-day CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is no higher than 260 ppm. In fact, CO<sub>2</sub> values have fallen by a minimum of 5 ppm (MIS 7 and MIS 11) and a maximum of 16 ppm (MIS 9 and MIS 17) in their final 8000 years. This spread implies an expected contemporary concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> as low as 244 ppm and sets another plausible upper limit of 255 ppm, bracketing a range that encompasses the 245 ppm concentration used in PI_NAT as our best estimate of a natural present-day value (see Methods).</p><p id="Par21">That a fairly small CO<sub>2</sub> decrease, relative to the CO<sub>2</sub> rise from industrialization, can leverage a large climate change is supported by findings of enhanced cold-climate sensitivity. Stronger positive feedbacks between temperature and albedo (in this case illustrated by a pronounced expansion of sea ice area and permanent snow cover) occur in relatively cold climates, such as those with greenhouse gas concentrations only slightly below those of PI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, implying that only a modest external forcing perturbation is then required to push the climate system into glacial inception. Further evidence for this enhanced cold climate sensitivity is found in comparisons of external forcing changes and climatic responses in the four CCSM4 simulations summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. PI_NAT has only modestly reduced GHG forcing relative to PI (&#x02212;1.02&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>), but there is a large increase in permanent snow cover and a large decrease in Arctic surface temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. MIS 19 has only a small net negative Arctic insolation forcing (&#x02212;0.75&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>) and a slightly smaller reduction in GHG forcing relative to PI (&#x02212;0.92&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>), yet the response is an equally large increase in permanent snow cover and nearly as large a decrease in Arctic temperature as in PI_NAT (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">In contrast, the glacial inception simulation of ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> for 115 ka (the end of MIS 5e) employs a much larger annual negative insolation forcing (&#x02212;4.3&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>) in the Arctic (60&#x02013;90&#x000b0;N) with no change in GHG forcing relative to PI and produces a large increase in permanent snow cover (although not quite as large as PI_NAT or MIS 19), along with a small decrease in Arctic annual temperature. The large orbitally forced decrease in summer temperature is sufficient to initiate the increase in permanent snow cover, even with GHG forcing equivalent to PI (the annual Arctic temperature decrease is smaller because the winter temperatures are higher). These experiments thus demonstrate &#x0201c;bookends&#x0201d; of forcing required for glacial inception: either strong orbital forcing with no change in greenhouse gases (MIS5e) or strong greenhouse forcing with little or no orbital influence (MIS19, PI_NAT) relative to present-day. Glacial inception occurs in all three cases, but cold climate sensitivity via a strengthened positive temperature/albedo feedback is most enhanced for PI_NAT and MIS 19, whose GHG forcing is slightly reduced relative to PI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">There are a number of caveats relevant to our conclusions. First, because there is no accepted definition of glacial inception, we developed our own to identify a major expansion of permanent snow cover. By requiring complete separation in the time series of hemispheric areal coverage between the equilibrated PI and MIS19 climates, we believe that this condition constitutes a fairly strict criterion to define incipient glaciation. However, we also recognize that any such measure is subjective and thus vulnerable to alternative definitions.</p><p id="Par24">Second, simulations of snow cover are highly dependent on variations in model topography, which cannot be fully represented in global climate models of ~1&#x000b0; horizontal resolution used here. This limitation is especially relevant in regions with cold climates and high elevations and thus becomes particularly important for MIS19. The expansion of permanent snow cover in a cooling climate can be strongly muted in coarse-resolution models that are unable to resolve small-scale topographic variations in mountainous areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, the inferred expansion of glaciation in our MIS19 simulation may be a conservative estimate.</p><p id="Par25">Third, the GHG concentrations used in the MIS19 experiment are subject to dating errors and interpolation uncertainties in selecting the most accurate values corresponding to a somewhat subjective date of 777 ka for the close of MIS19. However, we have used the recently updated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> estimates for CO<sub>2</sub>, and our target date agrees well with the end of MIS19 inferred from a recent high-precision <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar chronology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Differences in estimated GHG concentrations within a millennium of our target 777 ka date are small (2&#x02013;4 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> and 10&#x02013;50 ppb CH<sub>4</sub>) and result in minor radiative forcing differences within 0.10&#x02009;W&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Fourth, CCSM4 does not include ice sheet dynamics and relies on a crude way of accounting for glacial calving that constrains the buildup of a snowpack. This limitation necessitates the use of less precise indicators of glacier formation, such as where snow cover persists above a threshold and where it reaches the maximum allowable depth in the model. These indicators are thus simplifications of complex glacier processes, although our chosen sub-gridscale fractional threshold results in a 20<sup>th</sup> century CCSM4 simulation that agrees with observations of residual August snow cover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and we expect that small-scale topographic variations promote patchy snow cover in excess of the broader regional average.</p><p id="Par27">Fifth, CCSM4 has a cold bias in northern Canada and northern Siberia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> that predisposes the model toward forming permanent snow cover in a cooler climate. However, these are mostly cold-season biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; in spring-summer, the terrestrial cold bias is smaller, while the Canadian Archipelago even has a weak warm bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the model produces too much snow cover in its 20<sup>th</sup> century transient simulation over Alaska, the Rocky Mountains, and much of northern Canada (including Baffin), which are glacial inception regions in the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">A confluence of recent studies has greatly improved our understanding of glacial inception during MIS19, with respect to chronology, greenhouse forcing, and climate conditions, although there exist very few detailed observational records for evaluating our MIS19 model simulation. This study bolsters the body of evidence on the late MIS19 climate, when orbital conditions were very similar to present day. Our GCM simulations also significantly advance previous modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> by allowing a higher-resolution fingerprint of glacial inception using a more complete representation of climatic processes. The high resolution reveals important dynamical responses involving circulation changes combined with topographic influences that promote glacial inception through the emergence of permanent snow cover regionally. The model suggests that altered circulation in northeastern Canada and Siberia fosters nucleation via reduced ablation, while anomalous onshore and upslope flow from the Pacific Ocean favors glaciation in the Rocky Mountains via enhanced accumulation. Similar responses were found in a previous study with lowered GHG and shown to be directly attributable to higher model resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, whereas the simplified geography and coarse resolution of EMICs are unable to capture these regional changes. To the extent that these dynamical alterations stem from characteristic surface cooling patterns in colder climates, our findings provide new physical insights into the processes responsible for glacial inception generally. For example, prior research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> suggested that altered atmospheric circulation was critical for the inception of the Laurentide Ice Sheet by 116 ka, but that study was unable to identify the relevant physical mechanisms.</p><p id="Par29">This study builds on our own prior research through a novel investigation of the EAH by simulating an <italic>actual</italic> climate that should have strongly resembled a contemporary climate devoid of anthropogenic carbon emissions, rather than only relying on estimated boundary conditions, as in PI_NAT. Follow-up investigations will benefit from ongoing model developments to explicitly simulate ice sheet dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and increase resolution to even more realistically account for small-scale topographic variations and associated microclimates important for glacial nucleation. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to expand the coverage and spatiotemporal resolution of the very limited observational data for MIS19. In parallel, these kinds of advances in modeling and reconstructions will shed new light on the processes responsible for the end of the MIS19 interglacial climate and the vulnerability of contemporary climate to glacial inception in the absence of anthropogenic interference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Model description</title><p id="Par30">To estimate the climate at the end of MIS19, we employ the widely used Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), a fully coupled global climate model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.
