      <p>S.V. led the write-up of the manuscript and performed much of the analysis of model
         output. F.H. conducted the model simulations and performed most of the post-processing.
         J.K. advised on the experimental design of the model simulations and assisted in the
         write-up. W.R. developed the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis, established the model
         boundary conditions, and contributed to much of the write-up. P.C.T. contributed to
         the interpretation of the orbital signature and observational data of MIS 19.
