  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the climate at the end of MIS19, we employ the widely used Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), a fully coupled global climate model
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. The horizontal resolution in the land and atmospheric components is 1.25° latitude × 0.9° longitude, and the atmosphere is resolved into 26 layers. The ocean and sea ice models use variable grid spacing from 0.27° to 0.54° meridionally and uniform 1.11° zonally, while employing 60 vertical levels in the ocean. CCSM4 has one of the most accurate representations of the contemporary climate system
   <span class="sup">

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of particular importance in our study of cold-climate processes in MIS19 is the representation of snow cover and sea ice. CCSM4’s land model
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span> simulates snow cover extent reasonably well but is biased toward early melt
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
   </span> and tends to underestimate snow depth. The simulated snowpack is treated as a one-dimensional vertical column that accounts for accumulation and melting of fallen snow, as well as compaction and transfer of water between snow layers
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>. Fractional snow coverage within a grid box depends on snow density and snow depth, thus allowing for realistic patchiness of snow cover. To prevent unbounded snow buildup in the absence of an ice sheet dynamics model, CCSM4 limits the accumulation of snow depth to 1 m snow water equivalent. Any snowfall that exceeds this limit is converted into its equivalent fresh water volume and transferred to the ocean to ensure salinity balance.

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea ice component

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
   </span>, includes improvements in depicting radiative transfer, melt ponds, and ice dynamics. CCSM4 is among the best-performing models in simulating Arctic sea ice, due in part to its sophisticated treatment of melt ponds, a sub-gridscale ice thickness distribution, and improved solar radiation physics

  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our MIS19 simulation was integrated for 1420 years, initialized from a long control run using fixed boundary conditions for the pre-industrial climate at year 1850
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. Approximate equilibrium occurred by year 1150, when the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance was achieved and global mean surface temperatures stabilized. We compared the final five decades of the MIS19 simulation to a reference climate state of the last 50 years of a 1300 year-long pre-industrial run, “PI”, driven with modern orbital parameters and GHG concentrations matching those that occurred in year 1850 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Because of the lower GHG concentrations at 777 ka compared with 1850, which we attribute to the absence of early agricultural emissions in MIS 19, the greenhouse radiative forcing is nearly 1 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> lower in the MIS19 simulation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To remove the estimated influence of pre-industrial carbon emissions from early farming, we ran an additional experiment, PI_NAT, which represents our best estimate of the contemporary climate system in the absence of both industrialization and ancient agriculture. The orbital forcing of these two year-1850 experiments is identical, but PI_NAT uses GHG concentrations based on estimates of pre-industrial carbon emissions from archeological and paleoecological data (see below) and levels determined in our previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,

   </span> (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The resulting greenhouse radiative forcing is only slightly more negative (−0.12 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) in PI_NAT than in the MIS19 experiment.
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ancillary simulation of the present-day climate was also used for comparison (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). This transient “20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century” run was begun from the equilibrated, pre-industrial model climate of 1850 and integrated to 2005 using observed boundary conditions of solar irradiance, volcanoes, aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. The final 20 years of this experiment is taken to represent contemporary climatic conditions that include anthropogenic warming contributions from both industrialization and agriculture.

   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> derived for a natural Holocene are based on agreement between “top-down” and “bottom-up” evidence
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>. The top-down estimate is derived from extrapolated GHG concentrations from their early-mid Holocene values and is consistent with the average fall in CO
   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> during previous interglaciations. The interglacial average concentration of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and its envelope of interglacial spread provide strong evidence that the late Holocene CO
   <sub>2</sub> rise far exceeded expected bounds as early as 2,000 years ago (see Supplementary Information). The bottom-up estimate is obtained from carbon emission budgets from archeological and paleobotanical data. For example, the spread of irrigated rice in southeast Asia since the middle Holocene probably contributed most of the CH
   <sub>4</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene by 1000 years ago, with additional emissions caused by the spread of livestock and greater biomass burning of weeds and crop residues

   </span>. Likewise, the estimated 40 ppm reduction in CO
   <sub>2</sub> between PI and a natural contemporary value is based on revised land-use reconstructions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
   </span>. The resulting estimates of pre-industrial, anthropogenic carbon emissions account for a 24 ppm CO
   <sub>2</sub> difference, which swells to approximately 40 ppm when augmented by additional carbon outgassing from a warmer ocean

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of this study, we identify glacial inception in MIS19 if the simulated Northern Hemisphere snow cover area remaining at the end of the summer melt season (August) in all 50 years exceeds the corresponding hemispheric snow cover area in all 50 years of PI. In keeping with our previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
   </span>, we consider a grid cell to be snow covered if its areally averaged snow depth is at least 0.01 m. Based on the model’s parameterized conversion of grid-cell averaged snow depth to fractional coverage
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>, this depth limit translates to at least 5% snow cover. Furthermore, we find that this definition yields a simulated year-round snow cover area in the late 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> and early 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> centuries that nearly matches observations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. We also apply a more stringent alternative condition for defining incipient glaciation: regions where the simulated snow accumulation reaches the model-constrained maximum of 1 m snow water equivalent. Such locations imply glacial growth that is thwarted by the limits imposed by CCSM4. Utilizing both definitions provides a more complete perspective of glacial nucleation sites.
