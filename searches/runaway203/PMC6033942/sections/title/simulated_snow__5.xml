 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of particular importance in our study of cold-climate processes in MIS19 is the representation of snow cover and sea ice. CCSM4’s land model

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> and tends to underestimate snow depth. The simulated snowpack is treated as a one-dimensional vertical column that accounts for accumulation and melting of fallen snow, as well as compaction and transfer of water between snow layers

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. Fractional snow coverage within a grid box depends on snow density and snow depth, thus allowing for realistic patchiness of snow cover. To prevent unbounded snow buildup in the absence of an ice sheet dynamics model, CCSM4 limits the accumulation of snow depth to 1 m snow water equivalent. Any snowfall that exceeds this limit is converted into its equivalent fresh water volume and transferred to the ocean to ensure salinity balance.

CCSM4 is among the best-performing models in simulating Arctic sea ice, due in part to its sophisticated treatment of melt ponds, a sub-gridscale ice thickness distribution, and improved solar radiation physics
