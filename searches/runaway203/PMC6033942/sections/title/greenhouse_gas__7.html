      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentrations of CO
         <sub>2</sub> and CH
         <sub>4</sub> derived for a natural Holocene are based on agreement between “top-down” and “bottom-up”
         evidence
         <span><a>34</a></span>. The top-down estimate is derived from extrapolated GHG concentrations from their
         early-mid Holocene values and is consistent with the average fall in CO
         <sub>2</sub> and CH
         <sub>4</sub> during previous interglaciations. The interglacial average concentration of CO
         <sub>2</sub> and its envelope of interglacial spread provide strong evidence that the late Holocene
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> rise far exceeded expected bounds as early as 2,000 years ago (see Supplementary
         Information). The bottom-up estimate is obtained from carbon emission budgets from
         archeological and paleobotanical data. For example, the spread of irrigated rice in
         southeast Asia since the middle Holocene probably contributed most of the CH
         <sub>4</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene by 1000 years ago, with additional emissions caused
         by the spread of livestock and greater biomass burning of weeds and crop residues
         <span><a>34</a>,
            <a>56</a></span>. Likewise, the estimated 40 ppm reduction in CO
         <sub>2</sub> between PI and a natural contemporary value is based on revised land-use reconstructions
         <span><a>57</a></span> combined with new insights on historical per-capita land clearance
         <span><a>58</a></span>. The resulting estimates of pre-industrial, anthropogenic carbon emissions account
         for a 24 ppm CO
         <sub>2</sub> difference, which swells to approximately 40 ppm when augmented by additional carbon
         outgassing from a warmer ocean
         <span><a>34</a></span>.
