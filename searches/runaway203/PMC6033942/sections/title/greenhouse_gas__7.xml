  <sub>2</sub> and CH

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. The top-down estimate is derived from extrapolated GHG concentrations from their early-mid Holocene values and is consistent with the average fall in CO
  <sub>2</sub> and CH
  <sub>4</sub> during previous interglaciations. The interglacial average concentration of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and its envelope of interglacial spread provide strong evidence that the late Holocene CO
  <sub>2</sub> rise far exceeded expected bounds as early as 2,000 years ago (see Supplementary Information). The bottom-up estimate is obtained from carbon emission budgets from archeological and paleobotanical data. For example, the spread of irrigated rice in southeast Asia since the middle Holocene probably contributed most of the CH
  <sub>4</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene by 1000 years ago, with additional emissions caused by the spread of livestock and greater biomass burning of weeds and crop residues

  </span>. Likewise, the estimated 40 ppm reduction in CO
  <sub>2</sub> between PI and a natural contemporary value is based on revised land-use reconstructions

  </span> combined with new insights on historical per-capita land clearance

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. The resulting estimates of pre-industrial, anthropogenic carbon emissions account for a 24 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub> difference, which swells to approximately 40 ppm when augmented by additional carbon outgassing from a warmer ocean
