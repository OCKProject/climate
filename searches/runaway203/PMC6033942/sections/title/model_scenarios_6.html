      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our MIS19 simulation was integrated for 1420 years, initialized from a long control
         run using fixed boundary conditions for the pre-industrial climate at year 1850
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Approximate equilibrium occurred by year 1150, when the top-of-atmosphere radiative
         balance was achieved and global mean surface temperatures stabilized. We compared
         the final five decades of the MIS19 simulation to a reference climate state of the
         last 50 years of a 1300 year-long pre-industrial run, “PI”, driven with modern orbital
         parameters and GHG concentrations matching those that occurred in year 1850 (Table 
         <a>1</a>). Because of the lower GHG concentrations at 777 ka compared with 1850, which we
         attribute to the absence of early agricultural emissions in MIS 19, the greenhouse
         radiative forcing is nearly 1 W m
         <span>−2</span> lower in the MIS19 simulation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To remove the estimated influence of pre-industrial carbon emissions from early farming,
         we ran an additional experiment, PI_NAT, which represents our best estimate of the
         contemporary climate system in the absence of both industrialization and ancient agriculture.
         The orbital forcing of these two year-1850 experiments is identical, but PI_NAT uses
         GHG concentrations based on estimates of pre-industrial carbon emissions from archeological
         and paleoecological data (see below) and levels determined in our previous studies
         <span><a>37</a>,
            <a>39</a></span> (Table 
         <a>1</a>). The resulting greenhouse radiative forcing is only slightly more negative (−0.12 W m
         <span>−2</span>) in PI_NAT than in the MIS19 experiment.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ancillary simulation of the present-day climate was also used for comparison (Table 
         <a>1</a>). This transient “20
         <span>th</span> century” run was begun from the equilibrated, pre-industrial model climate of 1850
         and integrated to 2005 using observed boundary conditions of solar irradiance, volcanoes,
         aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The final 20 years of this experiment is taken to represent contemporary climatic
         conditions that include anthropogenic warming contributions from both industrialization
         and agriculture.
