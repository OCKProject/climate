      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of particular importance in our study of cold-climate processes in MIS19 is the representation
         of snow cover and sea ice. CCSM4’s land model
         <span><a>51</a></span> simulates snow cover extent reasonably well but is biased toward early melt
         <span><a>52</a></span> and tends to underestimate snow depth. The simulated snowpack is treated as a one-dimensional
         vertical column that accounts for accumulation and melting of fallen snow, as well
         as compaction and transfer of water between snow layers
         <span><a>53</a></span>. Fractional snow coverage within a grid box depends on snow density and snow depth,
         thus allowing for realistic patchiness of snow cover. To prevent unbounded snow buildup
         in the absence of an ice sheet dynamics model, CCSM4 limits the accumulation of snow
         depth to 1 m snow water equivalent. Any snowfall that exceeds this limit is converted
         into its equivalent fresh water volume and transferred to the ocean to ensure salinity
         balance.

            <a>55</a></span>, includes improvements in depicting radiative transfer, melt ponds, and ice dynamics.
         CCSM4 is among the best-performing models in simulating Arctic sea ice, due in part
         to its sophisticated treatment of melt ponds, a sub-gridscale ice thickness distribution,
         and improved solar radiation physics
