      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the climate at the end of MIS19, we employ the widely used Community Climate
         System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), a fully coupled global climate model
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The horizontal resolution in the land and atmospheric components is 1.25° latitude
         × 0.9° longitude, and the atmosphere is resolved into 26 layers. The ocean and sea
         ice models use variable grid spacing from 0.27° to 0.54° meridionally and uniform
         1.11° zonally, while employing 60 vertical levels in the ocean. CCSM4 has one of the
         most accurate representations of the contemporary climate system
         <span><a>44</a></span>, although it does have a cold, snowy bias in high northern latitudes
         <span><a>36</a></span>. This model has been used in paleoclimate studies of the mid-Holocene
         <span><a>45</a></span>, Last Millennium
         <span><a>46</a></span>, Glacial Inception
         <span><a>36</a></span>, and Last Glacial Maximum
         <span><a>47</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>. We have used CCSM4 and its predecessor versions in prior modeling studies of the
         EAH
