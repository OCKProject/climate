      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of this study, we identify glacial inception in MIS19 if the simulated
         Northern Hemisphere snow cover area remaining at the end of the summer melt season
         (August) in all 50 years exceeds the corresponding hemispheric snow cover area in
         all 50 years of PI. In keeping with our previous studies
         <span><a>59</a></span>, we consider a grid cell to be snow covered if its areally averaged snow depth is
         at least 0.01 m. Based on the model’s parameterized conversion of grid-cell averaged
         snow depth to fractional coverage
         <span><a>60</a></span>, this depth limit translates to at least 5% snow cover. Furthermore, we find that
         this definition yields a simulated year-round snow cover area in the late 20
         <span>th</span> and early 21
         <span>st</span> centuries that nearly matches observations
         <span><a>40</a></span>. We also apply a more stringent alternative condition for defining incipient glaciation:
         regions where the simulated snow accumulation reaches the model-constrained maximum
         of 1 m snow water equivalent. Such locations imply glacial growth that is thwarted
         by the limits imposed by CCSM4. Utilizing both definitions provides a more complete
         perspective of glacial nucleation sites.
