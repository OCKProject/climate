 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present a global climate model simulation, using the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4, see Methods), run on the interglaciation during Marine Isotope Stage 19c (MIS19)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> to provide a ground-truth analog for a contemporary climate system not affected by human activities. Both MIS19 and the MIS11 interglaciation have been considered as possible analogs to the Holocene (MIS1) (see Supplementary Information), but MIS19 is regarded as the best analog during the past 800,000 years for which ice-core records are available

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The insolation histories of MIS19 and MIS1 are very similar, such that their caloric half-year summer insolation differed by no more than 3 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> throughout (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The only significant difference in their orbital parameters is the weaker amplitude of the obliquity signal during MIS19. By the time equivalent to present day, however, the MIS19 obliquity was nearly identical to the modern value, and the precession and eccentricity parameters were also very similar (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The strong orbital resemblance between MIS19 and MIS1 enables direct comparisons between climatic signals from these two interglaciations, including GHG trends, such that the closest insolation analog to the present day occurred at the corresponding insolation minimum 777,000 years ago at the close of MIS19

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantial glacial inception likely began by 777,500 to 775,500 years ago, based on various criteria: the appearance of millennial-scale oxygen-isotopic oscillations in marine cores, the appearance of ice-rafted debris in marine cores, and an assumed delay between these first-appearance criteria and the accumulation of enough terrestrial ice to have driven them

 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparable orbital configurations but contrasting glaciation histories of MIS19 and MIS1 motivated a recent modeling study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> using a low-resolution Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) to compare the potential for glacial inception in both stages. The model simulated a buildup of large-scale ice volume at the close of MIS19, whereas glaciation during MIS1 depended critically on whether Holocene CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations followed an inferred natural trajectory to 240 ppm (slightly lower than our estimate) or the actual trajectory of 280–285 ppm by the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper also investigates the onset of glaciation in MIS19 but does so using a much higher-resolution global climate model (GCM) simulation that represents circulation patterns, energy transport, and hydrologic processes much more realistically than an EMIC. Furthermore, we ran a single, unconstrained simulation, whereas the previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> first screened a 20-member perturbed-physics model ensemble and selected only the 20% of simulations that matched observations of glacial inception at the end of MIS19 and MIS5 but not MIS1. Our CCSM4 GCM experiment of MIS19 informs whether contemporary climate conditions are suitable for glacial inception under the much lower GHG concentrations estimated in the absence of both ancient and recent carbon emissions from agriculture and industrialization.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, can be compared between MIS19 and MIS1. The MIS19 CO
  <sub>2</sub> trend reached an early peak of 269 ppm, essentially identical to the peak of 270 ppm early in MIS1, after which both trends started falling (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The MIS19 trend continued declining through the time of the modern-day equivalent (777,000 years ago), but the MIS1 trend reversed direction 7000–8000 years ago and rose for the remainder of the Holocene. These opposing trends are consistent with the prediction from the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis (EAH) that MIS1 values would have continued falling if not for early agriculture, as they did in other recent interglacials
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The 245-ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration estimated as the modern-day equivalent in MIS19 (see Methods) is very close to the interpolated 248 ppm value from the latest Dome C data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The difference in CO
  <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing between 245 ppm and 248 ppm amounts to only 0.06 W m

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). The MIS19 concentration then dropped to a value of 631 ppb by the time of the modern-day equivalent at 777 ka, interrupted by a brief CH
  <sub>4</sub> maximum near 778 ka that is interpreted as a millennial-scale oscillation because it was defined by two data points separated by just a little over 1000 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The CH
  <sub>4</sub> trend then resumed its gradual orbital-scale downward trend through (and beyond) the time of the modern-day equivalent, dropping to 530 ppb by around 772 ka (not shown). In contrast, the MIS1 CH
  <sub>4</sub> trend reversed direction 5000 years ago and has moved steadily upward since then, reaching around 790 ppb just before the industrial greenhouse-gas era began in 1850. These opposing directions (down for MIS19, up for MIS1) are again consistent with the EAH prediction. In this case, however, the MIS19 CH
  <sub>4</sub> trend remained higher than the downward path of the MIS1 trend proposed in the EAH, based on the average trend of many recent interglaciations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> and estimated Holocene emissions arising from plant and animal domestication (see Methods), but the effect of this difference on radiative forcing is small compared with the influence of CO
  <sub>2</sub>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ideally, the contemporary “natural” CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in the absence of all anthropogenic carbon emissions would be derived from an interactive carbon cycle model with an accompanying dynamical vegetation model. Unfortunately, neither of these modules is up to the task. Coupled carbon cycle models in GCMs are unreliable in their simulations of the observed industrial-era rise in CO
  <sub>2</sub>, producing a 45 ppm spread in near-present-day concentration
  <span class="sup">

  <sub>2</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene that we are studying. Interactive global vegetation models in GCMs often produce unrealistic distributions of grasses and trees in the present-day climate, highly divergent future vegetation distributions even for the same climatic forcing scenario, and a large spread in their carbon-climate feedback parameters
