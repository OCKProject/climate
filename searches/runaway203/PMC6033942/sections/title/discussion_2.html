      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of caveats relevant to our conclusions. First, because there is
         no accepted definition of glacial inception, we developed our own to identify a major
         expansion of permanent snow cover. By requiring complete separation in the time series
         of hemispheric areal coverage between the equilibrated PI and MIS19 climates, we believe
         that this condition constitutes a fairly strict criterion to define incipient glaciation.
         However, we also recognize that any such measure is subjective and thus vulnerable
         to alternative definitions.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, simulations of snow cover are highly dependent on variations in model topography,
         which cannot be fully represented in global climate models of ~1° horizontal resolution
         used here. This limitation is especially relevant in regions with cold climates and
         high elevations and thus becomes particularly important for MIS19. The expansion of
         permanent snow cover in a cooling climate can be strongly muted in coarse-resolution
         models that are unable to resolve small-scale topographic variations in mountainous
         areas
         <span><a>37</a>,
            <a>38</a></span>. Therefore, the inferred expansion of glaciation in our MIS19 simulation may be a
         conservative estimate.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the GHG concentrations used in the MIS19 experiment are subject to dating errors
         and interpolation uncertainties in selecting the most accurate values corresponding
         to a somewhat subjective date of 777 ka for the close of MIS19. However, we have used
         the recently updated
         <span><a>6</a></span> estimates for CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and our target date agrees well with the end of MIS19 inferred from a recent high-precision
         
         <span>40</span>Ar/
         <span>39</span>Ar chronology
         <span><a>4</a></span>. Differences in estimated GHG concentrations within a millennium of our target 777
         ka date are small (2–4 ppm CO
         <sub>2</sub> and 10–50 ppb CH
         <sub>4</sub>) and result in minor radiative forcing differences within 0.10 W m
         <span>−2</span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, CCSM4 does not include ice sheet dynamics and relies on a crude way of accounting
         for glacial calving that constrains the buildup of a snowpack. This limitation necessitates
         the use of less precise indicators of glacier formation, such as where snow cover
         persists above a threshold and where it reaches the maximum allowable depth in the
         model. These indicators are thus simplifications of complex glacier processes, although
         our chosen sub-gridscale fractional threshold results in a 20
         <span>th</span> century CCSM4 simulation that agrees with observations of residual August snow cover
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>, and we expect that small-scale topographic variations promote patchy snow cover
         in excess of the broader regional average.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifth, CCSM4 has a cold bias in northern Canada and northern Siberia
         <span><a>41</a></span> that predisposes the model toward forming permanent snow cover in a cooler climate.
         However, these are mostly cold-season biases
         <span><a>36</a></span>; in spring-summer, the terrestrial cold bias is smaller, while the Canadian Archipelago
         even has a weak warm bias
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Nevertheless, the model produces too much snow cover in its 20
         <span>th</span> century transient simulation over Alaska, the Rocky Mountains, and much of northern
         Canada (including Baffin), which are glacial inception regions in the model
         <span><a>42</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A confluence of recent studies has greatly improved our understanding of glacial inception
         during MIS19, with respect to chronology, greenhouse forcing, and climate conditions,
         although there exist very few detailed observational records for evaluating our MIS19
         model simulation. This study bolsters the body of evidence on the late MIS19 climate,
         when orbital conditions were very similar to present day. Our GCM simulations also
         significantly advance previous modeling
         <span><a>5</a></span> by allowing a higher-resolution fingerprint of glacial inception using a more complete
         representation of climatic processes. The high resolution reveals important dynamical
         responses involving circulation changes combined with topographic influences that
         promote glacial inception through the emergence of permanent snow cover regionally.
         The model suggests that altered circulation in northeastern Canada and Siberia fosters
         nucleation via reduced ablation, while anomalous onshore and upslope flow from the
         Pacific Ocean favors glaciation in the Rocky Mountains via enhanced accumulation.
         Similar responses were found in a previous study with lowered GHG and shown to be
         directly attributable to higher model resolution
         <span><a>37</a></span>, whereas the simplified geography and coarse resolution of EMICs are unable to capture
         these regional changes. To the extent that these dynamical alterations stem from characteristic
         surface cooling patterns in colder climates, our findings provide new physical insights
         into the processes responsible for glacial inception generally. For example, prior
         research
         <span><a>29</a></span> suggested that altered atmospheric circulation was critical for the inception of
         the Laurentide Ice Sheet by 116 ka, but that study was unable to identify the relevant
         physical mechanisms.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study builds on our own prior research through a novel investigation of the EAH
         by simulating an 
         <span>actual</span> climate that should have strongly resembled a contemporary climate devoid of anthropogenic
         carbon emissions, rather than only relying on estimated boundary conditions, as in
         PI_NAT. Follow-up investigations will benefit from ongoing model developments to explicitly
         simulate ice sheet dynamics
         <span><a>43</a></span> and increase resolution to even more realistically account for small-scale topographic
         variations and associated microclimates important for glacial nucleation. Furthermore,
         there is a pressing need to expand the coverage and spatiotemporal resolution of the
         very limited observational data for MIS19. In parallel, these kinds of advances in
         modeling and reconstructions will shed new light on the processes responsible for
         the end of the MIS19 interglacial climate and the vulnerability of contemporary climate
         to glacial inception in the absence of anthropogenic interference.
