 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our MIS19 simulation was integrated for 1420 years, initialized from a long control run using fixed boundary conditions for the pre-industrial climate at year 1850
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Approximate equilibrium occurred by year 1150, when the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance was achieved and global mean surface temperatures stabilized. We compared the final five decades of the MIS19 simulation to a reference climate state of the last 50 years of a 1300 year-long pre-industrial run, “PI”, driven with modern orbital parameters and GHG concentrations matching those that occurred in year 1850 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Because of the lower GHG concentrations at 777 ka compared with 1850, which we attribute to the absence of early agricultural emissions in MIS 19, the greenhouse radiative forcing is nearly 1 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> lower in the MIS19 simulation.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To remove the estimated influence of pre-industrial carbon emissions from early farming, we ran an additional experiment, PI_NAT, which represents our best estimate of the contemporary climate system in the absence of both industrialization and ancient agriculture. The orbital forcing of these two year-1850 experiments is identical, but PI_NAT uses GHG concentrations based on estimates of pre-industrial carbon emissions from archeological and paleoecological data (see below) and levels determined in our previous studies

  </span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The resulting greenhouse radiative forcing is only slightly more negative (−0.12 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) in PI_NAT than in the MIS19 experiment.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ancillary simulation of the present-day climate was also used for comparison (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). This transient “20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century” run was begun from the equilibrated, pre-industrial model climate of 1850 and integrated to 2005 using observed boundary conditions of solar irradiance, volcanoes, aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations

  </span>. The final 20 years of this experiment is taken to represent contemporary climatic conditions that include anthropogenic warming contributions from both industrialization and agriculture.
