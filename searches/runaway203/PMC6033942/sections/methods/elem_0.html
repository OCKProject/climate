            System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), a fully coupled global climate model

            ice models use variable grid spacing from 0.27° to 0.54° meridionally and uniform
            1.11° zonally, while employing 60 vertical levels in the ocean. CCSM4 has one of the

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of particular importance in our study of cold-climate processes in MIS19 is the representation
            of snow cover and sea ice. CCSM4’s land model
            <span><a>51</a></span> simulates snow cover extent reasonably well but is biased toward early melt
            <span><a>52</a></span> and tends to underestimate snow depth. The simulated snowpack is treated as a one-dimensional
            vertical column that accounts for accumulation and melting of fallen snow, as well
            as compaction and transfer of water between snow layers
            <span><a>53</a></span>. Fractional snow coverage within a grid box depends on snow density and snow depth,
            thus allowing for realistic patchiness of snow cover. To prevent unbounded snow buildup
            in the absence of an ice sheet dynamics model, CCSM4 limits the accumulation of snow
            depth to 1 m snow water equivalent. Any snowfall that exceeds this limit is converted
            into its equivalent fresh water volume and transferred to the ocean to ensure salinity
            balance.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our MIS19 simulation was integrated for 1420 years, initialized from a long control
            run using fixed boundary conditions for the pre-industrial climate at year 1850
            <span><a>41</a></span>. Approximate equilibrium occurred by year 1150, when the top-of-atmosphere radiative
            balance was achieved and global mean surface temperatures stabilized. We compared
            the final five decades of the MIS19 simulation to a reference climate state of the
            last 50 years of a 1300 year-long pre-industrial run, “PI”, driven with modern orbital
            parameters and GHG concentrations matching those that occurred in year 1850 (Table 
            <a>1</a>). Because of the lower GHG concentrations at 777 ka compared with 1850, which we
            attribute to the absence of early agricultural emissions in MIS 19, the greenhouse
            radiative forcing is nearly 1 W m
            <span>−2</span> lower in the MIS19 simulation.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To remove the estimated influence of pre-industrial carbon emissions from early farming,
            we ran an additional experiment, PI_NAT, which represents our best estimate of the
            contemporary climate system in the absence of both industrialization and ancient agriculture.
            The orbital forcing of these two year-1850 experiments is identical, but PI_NAT uses
            GHG concentrations based on estimates of pre-industrial carbon emissions from archeological
            and paleoecological data (see below) and levels determined in our previous studies
            <span><a>37</a>,
               <a>39</a></span> (Table 
            <a>1</a>). The resulting greenhouse radiative forcing is only slightly more negative (−0.12 W m
            <span>−2</span>) in PI_NAT than in the MIS19 experiment.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ancillary simulation of the present-day climate was also used for comparison (Table 
            <a>1</a>). This transient “20
            <span>th</span> century” run was begun from the equilibrated, pre-industrial model climate of 1850
            and integrated to 2005 using observed boundary conditions of solar irradiance, volcanoes,
            aerosols, and greenhouse gas concentrations
            <span><a>41</a></span>. The final 20 years of this experiment is taken to represent contemporary climatic
            conditions that include anthropogenic warming contributions from both industrialization
            and agriculture.

            <sub>2</sub> and CH
            <sub>4</sub> derived for a natural Holocene are based on agreement between “top-down” and “bottom-up”
            evidence
            <span><a>34</a></span>. The top-down estimate is derived from extrapolated GHG concentrations from their
            early-mid Holocene values and is consistent with the average fall in CO
            <sub>2</sub> and CH
            <sub>4</sub> during previous interglaciations. The interglacial average concentration of CO
            <sub>2</sub> and its envelope of interglacial spread provide strong evidence that the late Holocene
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> rise far exceeded expected bounds as early as 2,000 years ago (see Supplementary
            Information). The bottom-up estimate is obtained from carbon emission budgets from
            archeological and paleobotanical data. For example, the spread of irrigated rice in
            southeast Asia since the middle Holocene probably contributed most of the CH
            <sub>4</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene by 1000 years ago, with additional emissions caused
            by the spread of livestock and greater biomass burning of weeds and crop residues
            <span><a>34</a>,
               <a>56</a></span>. Likewise, the estimated 40 ppm reduction in CO

            <span><a>57</a></span> combined with new insights on historical per-capita land clearance
            <span><a>58</a></span>. The resulting estimates of pre-industrial, anthropogenic carbon emissions account
            for a 24 ppm CO
            <sub>2</sub> difference, which swells to approximately 40 ppm when augmented by additional carbon
            outgassing from a warmer ocean

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of this study, we identify glacial inception in MIS19 if the simulated
            Northern Hemisphere snow cover area remaining at the end of the summer melt season
            (August) in all 50 years exceeds the corresponding hemispheric snow cover area in
            all 50 years of PI. In keeping with our previous studies
            <span><a>59</a></span>, we consider a grid cell to be snow covered if its areally averaged snow depth is
            at least 0.01 m. Based on the model’s parameterized conversion of grid-cell averaged
            snow depth to fractional coverage
            <span><a>60</a></span>, this depth limit translates to at least 5% snow cover. Furthermore, we find that
            this definition yields a simulated year-round snow cover area in the late 20
            <span>th</span> and early 21
            <span>st</span> centuries that nearly matches observations
            <span><a>40</a></span>. We also apply a more stringent alternative condition for defining incipient glaciation:
            regions where the simulated snow accumulation reaches the model-constrained maximum
            of 1 m snow water equivalent. Such locations imply glacial growth that is thwarted
            by the limits imposed by CCSM4. Utilizing both definitions provides a more complete
            perspective of glacial nucleation sites.
