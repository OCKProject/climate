  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our uncertainty estimate also depends on the range of global climate model (GCM) outputs used to force the LSMs, accounting for both the structural uncertainty arising from the different GCM’s climate sensitivities, as well as the irreducible uncertainty arising from weather and climate variability. To capture this uncertainty in the PCF, both LSMs were forced with output from a range of GCMs, sampling the full range of expected Arctic responses under a given climate scenario to 2300. SiBCASA is an explicit LSM and was run to 2300 with output from five CMIP5 GCMs under two scenarios, whereas JULES was configured to run to 2300 with output from 22 CMIP3 GCMs under three climate scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Having information to 2300 is important to capture the nonlinear transitions in the permafrost emissions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dynamic PCF emulator uses a statistical fit to SiBCASA and JULES outputs for the land permafrost carbon emissions in the form of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and methane, capturing nonlinear effects seen in the LSM simulations. The PCF emulator only models the emitted permafrost carbon explicitly, while also accounting for the time lags between the temperature rise, thawed carbon and emitted carbon, as well as the uncertainty in the initial permafrost carbon stock

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We base the SAF emulator on the ALL/CLR method of calculating the SAF using downward and upward atmospheric transmissivity and reflectivity inferred from climate models (GCMs)

   </span>. The method involves an atmospheric reflectivity parameterisation, which represents the effect of clouds and is based on clear sky and all sky shortwave fluxes diagnosed from the GCMs. It allows us to account for the localised changes to the cloud cover and its effect on the SAF in line with the physical interactions represented in the fully-coupled CMIP5 models (Supplementary Figure

   </span>. While short of the complete CMIP5 ensemble, these models sample the full range of Arctic responses as seen in the whole ensemble. Eight of the models have simulations that extend out to 2300, which is necessary to capture the nonlinear transitions in the SAF. Each model has its own domains for Arctic sea ice and land snow covers based on their respective monthly maximum extents during the pre-industrial period. The SAF, therefore, is separated into the northern hemispheric sea ice, northern hemispheric land snow and rest of the world. The components are represented as functions of the GMST rise individually for each model, at which point the multi-model statistics is established (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The sea ice and land snow components of the SAF peak for the GMST anomalies between 0–1 °C and 1–3 °C, respectively, coinciding with the loss of the summer sea ice

   <sub>2</sub> ECS parameter (Methods), the SAF emulator accounts for the difference between the nonlinear SAF and its constant legacy value. It alters the governing equation for the GMST change in PAGE-ICE by adding extra terms to the total anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF) for a given climate scenario (Supplementary Note

  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the legacy value is zero, the PCF increases GMST for all scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The slow response of permafrost to thaw means the change in GMST before 2100 due to the PCF is nearly the same for all scenarios except Zero Emissions. The difference between the scenarios only becomes apparent in the 22nd and 23rd centuries, with the GMST effect of the PCF becoming progressively stronger as emissions increase towards BaU. The GMST increases are virtually indistinguishable between NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU because the marginal effect on GMST of additional CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions from the PCF drops as total atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations increase. In addition, the highest emissions scenarios exhaust the permafrost carbon stocks in some simulations, causing a drop in the annual CO
   <sub>2</sub> flux from permafrost beyond 2200. This results in carbon removal from the atmosphere through CO
   <sub>2</sub> ocean uptake (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and causes a slight decline in the GMST effect of the PCF in the 23rd century for the BaU scenario.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonlinear SAF is dominated by the decrease of its sea ice and land snow components (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), resulting in less warming and negative GMST changes compared to the constant legacy SAF (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). The NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU scenarios have the largest temperature increases and greatest decreases in land snow and sea ice SAF components, and thus show the greatest negative differences in GMST. The differences are the highest for BaU with nearly ice-free oceans and snow-free land even in winter after 2200. For the Zero Emissions, 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and 2.5 °C scenarios, there are small increases in GMST for the entire time period due to the small peaks in the sea ice and land snow SAF components within this temperature range (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Overall, the constant legacy SAF appears reasonable for low emission scenarios, but overestimates GMST for high emission scenarios according to the current generation of climate models (CMIP5), with no apparent tipping points (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonlinear SAF can partially compensate for the PCF (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). For the high emission NDC, NDC Partial, and BaU scenarios, reduced warming due to the nonlinear response of the SAF partially cancels out warming due to the PCF. The effect is strongest for the BaU scenario, where the change in GMST from the legacy value switches sign from positive to negative. The SAF slightly amplifies the PCF for the low emission scenarios where the constant SAF forcing assumption remains valid (Zero Emissions, 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and 2.5 °C). This means IAMs that do not include the PCF and assume a constant SAF will underestimate GMST by between 0.1 and 0.2 C for all but the highest emissions scenarios. These findings stemming from the nonlinearities both in the PCF and SAF have been overlooked in climate policy studies so far (Supplementary Note

   </span>. While the state-dependencies in the planetary feedbacks require further investigations as part of CMIP6, the evidence so far suggests that apart from the SAF effects presented here, the magnitudes of the feedbacks are less likely to decrease with GMST. This implies that our estimates for the impacts of the state-dependent PCF and SAF are likely to be on a conservative side.

   </span>. Of the two most recent studies on the cloud feedback that were based on observational constraints, one matched closely with the ECS parameterisation from IPCC AR5 adopted in PAGE-ICE, suggesting that our climate projections are robust. The uncertainties in the permafrost models used in this study, robustness of our PCF and SAF emulators, and uncertainties in other key parameterisations such as the carbon cycle, sea level rise, mitigation business as usual pathway and economic impacts of rising temperatures are discussed in Methods and
