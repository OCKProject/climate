  <p>Cumulative carbon emissions from thawing land permafrost simulated using specialised land surface models.Â CO
   <sub>2</sub> component of cumulative emissions of carbon from thawing land permafrost, obtained from 
   <span class="bold">a</span> SiBCASA and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> JULES LSMs forced by multiple climate models (GCMs) under a range of climate scenarios out to 2300. Thick lines: multi-GCM means; shaded areas: multi-GCM spread between the lowest and the highest values; thin black lines: SiBCASA runs with individual GCMs. Horizontal black dashed lines: legacy zero permafrost emissions currently assumed in IAMs. Units: GtC.
