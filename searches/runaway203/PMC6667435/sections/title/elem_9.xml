A new energy database was established based on a rural residential energy survey that covered detailed energy use activities, including staple food cooking, side dish preparation, water boiling, animal feed heating, and space heating for more than 34,400 households and daily biomass fuel consumption quantities for more than 1600 households

The rural residential energy database covered detailed information on various energy types including coal, honeycomb briquette, straw, corncob, fuelwood, brushwood, charcoal, LPG, biogas, and electricity. The emission factor database was re-compiled based on carefully screened data from published studies conducted in China. For CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission calculation, all crop residues were considered carbon neutral, and for fuelwood, the non-renewable fractions for all individual provinces in China were sourced from the literature

   <span class="sup">2</span> horizontal resolution and a 5-min time step. Because population density varies with short distances, the calculated PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were downscaled to 30-arc sec in both longitude and latitude, based on wind fields and the emissions inventory
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. In brief, the model- calculated concentrations were interpolated to a finer resolution using 0.1 degree emission inventory as a proxy with the wind-field justified. The detailed downscaling method can be found elsewhere
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. It is reasonable to expect that direct use of emissions in this study can provide better results. A statistically significant relationship between emissions and annual mean PM

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. The WRF meteorological inputs were evaluated against observations from China Earth International Exchange Stations. The normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) were calculated for all validations. The NMB for surface pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were −3%, −7% ~ −10%, −2% ~ −9 and 32% ~43%, respectively (Supplementary Table

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a> shows the spatial pattern of the differences between the modelled PM

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. Our results were lower in the sparsely populated western area and higher in some southeast sites. Previous studies found that satellite-derived PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> might underestimate PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> levels during heavy pollution episodes and overestimate PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in low pollution cases

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
   </span>. The discrepancy is also likely from uncertainties in chemical transport model inputs such as air emissions of PM

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). The differences could come from the uncertainties in modelling, as well as uncertainties in limited observations with different sampling and analytical methods. With all the results taken into consideration, the model-predicted ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and the spatiotemporal variations are generally acceptable.
