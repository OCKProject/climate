 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, WRF/Chem version 3.5 was applied to model the daily PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in ambient air for 1992, 2002, 2007, and 2012 in China (13°N-56°N; 67°E-143°E, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). In brief, the RADM2 chemical mechanism for the gas phase and the MADE/SORGAM aerosol scheme were adopted with a 50 × 50 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> horizontal resolution and a 5-min time step. Because population density varies with short distances, the calculated PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were downscaled to 30-arc sec in both longitude and latitude, based on wind fields and the emissions inventory
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. In brief, the model- calculated concentrations were interpolated to a finer resolution using 0.1 degree emission inventory as a proxy with the wind-field justified. The detailed downscaling method can be found elsewhere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Another commonly used method for downscaling is land-use regression, in which land-use is primarily used as a proxy for emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. It is reasonable to expect that direct use of emissions in this study can provide better results. A statistically significant relationship between emissions and annual mean PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in individual grids has been demonstrated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. The WRF meteorological inputs were evaluated against observations from China Earth International Exchange Stations. The normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) were calculated for all validations. The NMB for surface pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were −3%, −7% ~ −10%, −2% ~ −9 and 32% ~43%, respectively (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). According to the results of a reduced-form modelling, the meteorological conditions in these 4 years were close to the multi-year average
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Prior to 2013, there was no official routine monitoring program for ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> in China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, and sampled PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> data were only available from several field studies reported in the literature and those released from the U.S. Embassy. To validate our modelling results, in addition to comparing with available observational data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), the modelled PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were also compared to those retrieved from the satellite remote sensing, which have been widely used in the scientific community
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>, and compared to those estimated based on visibility records in China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Overall, our model simulated concentrations were slightly higher than the observation data (NMB = 25–30%, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a> and NMB = 3%, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), but considerably lower than those retrieved from the satellite and visibility retrieved results (NMB = −61% ~ −5%, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a> shows the spatial pattern of the differences between the modelled PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in this study and those retrieved from the satellite-derived data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Our results were lower in the sparsely populated western area and higher in some southeast sites. Previous studies found that satellite-derived PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> might underestimate PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> levels during heavy pollution episodes and overestimate PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in low pollution cases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. The discrepancy is also likely from uncertainties in chemical transport model inputs such as air emissions of PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> precursors, and missing mechanisms in the model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. We further compared the modelled major PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> components with measured data, including black carbon (NMB = 67%), organic carbon (NMB = −3%), sulfate (NMB = −12%), nitrate (NMB = 49%), and ammonium (NMB = 38%) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). The differences could come from the uncertainties in modelling, as well as uncertainties in limited observations with different sampling and analytical methods. With all the results taken into consideration, the model-predicted ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and the spatiotemporal variations are generally acceptable.

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> was adopted by running the model three times using emission scenarios of: a 20% reduction in the rural residential sources; a 20% reduction in all but the residential sources; and all sources. The influences on the rural and urban areas were evaluated separately. Rural and urban areas were spatially distinguished by using a dynamic urban mask developed Shen et al., (2017)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. In brief, the urban mask was developed by extracting built-up areas (urban) using remote sensing data, night-time light data, and population census data, based on county-specific thresholds.
