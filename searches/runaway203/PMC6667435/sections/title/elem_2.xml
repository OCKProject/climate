  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the rapid transition of cooking and heating energy from solid fuels towards clean fuels and electricity, as well as a rapid urbanization, most air pollutant emissions from the rural residential sector have been reduced over the last two decades; however, this sector remains a significant source of many air pollutants, contributing 39% and 46% of the total emissions of BC and organic carbon (OC) in 2012, respectively
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>. Based on the results of atmospheric chemical transport modelling (see Method), in 2012, the increment contributed by rural residential emissions to the national annual mean ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 5.4 ± 6.1 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span> with high spatial variations. This value corresponds to a relative contribution of one-third (33 ± 17%) of the total PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentration in ambient air originating from all anthropogenic emission sources including power generation, industry, and transportation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of uneven population distribution, the population-weighted concentration (PWC) was different from the air quality concentration. The contribution from rural residential emissions to the annual mean PWC was 14 ± 10 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>, accounting for 21 ± 14% of the total PWC from all sources. The national average rural residential source associated PWC (14 µg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>) was almost three times the average ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentration attributable to rural residential emissions (5.4 µg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>). Since the National Grade-I standard

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the emissions from this sector occur only in rural areas, their contribution to air pollution is not limited to such areas. According to the model results, the absolute contribution of rural residential emissions to the average ambient PM

   <span class="sup">3</span>) was even higher than that in rural areas (5.3 ± 6.0 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>). This outcome occurred because vast areas in western China with very low population densities are far from high emission regions, whereas most populated cities are located in eastern China and surrounded by highly populated rural villages. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the PWC between rural (13 ± 6 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>) and urban (14 ± 13 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>) areas, due to higher urban population density. In relative terms, the contributions of rural residential emissions in rural areas, for both air concentration (33 ± 17%) and PWC (23 ± 13%), were higher than those in urban areas (21 ± 15% and 20 ± 17%, respectively), due to strong emissions from other sectors in urban areas.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the contribution of the rural residential sector to air pollution remained significant in 2012, it was even higher prior to 2012. Because of the rapid transition of the rural residential energy mix over the past two decades, from domination by solid fuels to clean fuels and electricity, the contribution of this sector to the ambient air concentration has decreased. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the decreasing trends of the PWC in both absolute (A) and relative (B) terms for urban, rural, and national averages from 1992 to 2012. In 1992, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to the overall ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> and PWC were as high as 45 ± 11% and 39 ± 13%, respectively. Over the 20-year period, the national average PWC decreased by ~26% from 18 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span> to 14 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>. The relative decrease of the national average was even more rapid from 39% to 21% because the air pollutant emissions from other sectors increased during this same period

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In comparison with other major emission sectors including power stations, industry, and transportation, after the rapid transition towards clean fuels and electricity, the relative contribution of the residential sector to the annual mean PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> PWC (21 ± 14%) has been relatively low. However, because of the strong seasonality of heating needs in northern China, there has been very high seasonal variation in this contribution. For example, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> shows the monthly contributions of rural residential emissions to PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in China in 1992 and shows strong seasonality. On a national scale, the rural residential sector contributed 33 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span> PM

   <span class="sup">3</span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the seasonal patterns were similar among the four study years, the differences between the heating and non-heating seasons increased over this period. The ratios of the relative contributions between winter and summer months increased from 1.8 (1992) to 2.4 (2002), 2.8 (2007), and 3.7 (2012). This trend can be explained by the fact that, at this stage, the rural residential energy transition occurred primarily for cooking activities. The time-sharing fraction of using LPG, biogas, and electricity for cooking increased from 7% in 1992 to 59% in 2012, whereas the fraction for heating only reached 15% in 2012
   <span class="sup">

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) but also different geographical distribution patterns of the contributions, with much higher levels in northern China during heating periods due to high heating demand. The spatial variation was enhanced by population weighting for assessing exposure, as shown by provincial averages in Fig.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current air pollution control strategy focuses on the most polluted and populated regions, including the North China Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and Northeastern Plain, where ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in winter are generally higher than those in summer
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. In addition to poor dispersion conditions, heating activity in rural areas is definitely one of the most important reasons for the severe air pollution in winter. Despite increasing concerns on this issue
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>, the contribution to exposure has not been well quantified in the literature. To fill this data gap, the contributions of rural residential emissions to the PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in all provinces were calculated. The results are listed in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> in both absolute and relative terms. The relatively high standard deviation values indicate high spatial variation. For the provinces in the North China Plain and Guanzhong Plain, the annual mean contributions were not higher than the national averages. However, the winter (January) values were much higher. For most provinces in the northeast, north, and northwest, except for Beijing and Tianjin, the relative contributions in January were between 27% and 51%, accounting for approximately one-third to one-half of the PWC in the region. The values for the residential emissions alone are already approaching or exceeding the National Grade-I standard of 35 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. More importantly, the absolute contributions of rural residential emissions to the PWC in cities in eastern China are often close to, or even higher than, those in rural areas. For example, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in urban and rural areas in Heilongjiang were 24 ± 14% and 32 ± 10%, respectively. The values were 41 ± 29% and 18 ± 9% for the urban and rural areas in Inner Mongolia, respectively, likely due to the very low population density in rural areas. Although the relative contributions in western provinces such as Xingjiang (34 ± 25%) and Qinghai (23 ± 14%) were even higher, the absolute contributions were much lower (2.9 ± 2.8 and 3.3 ± 2.6 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>, respectively) than those in the east. The contributions were much higher in 1992 compared to those in 2012, indicating a rapid reduction due to the clean energy transition. For example, the absolute and relative contributions in January in 1992 were as high as 53 ± 25 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span> and 60 ± 15% in Hebei, and 77 ± 16 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span> and 69 ± 7% in Henan provinces, respectively, which are among the most populated provinces in China. The rural residential energy transition resulted in a significantly reduced contribution to overall air pollution. Although this trend is promising, the rural residential sector still plays a critical role in PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> pollution, especially in northern China during winter. The emissions from this source should be remediated before the nationwide air pollution issue can finally be solved.

Although baseline mortality rates changed rapidly during this period, the decrease in the mortality attributable to rural residential emissions was still significant from 1992 to 2012, with the influence of the population growth, aging, and age-standardised mortality rate adjusted (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The estimated number of deaths avoided due to decreased rural residential exposure was approximately 130,000 (90,000–160,000). During the same period, because of general increase in emissions from other anthropogenic sources, the total premature deaths induced by exposure to PM

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One limitation of this study is that only the influences on ambient air pollution and associated health impacts were addressed. In reality, another equally, if not more, important effect caused by solid fuel consumption, and impacted by the transition away from it, is household air pollution associated with emissions from indoor solid fuel combustion
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. Both ambient and household air quality can benefit from the rural residential energy transition. Unfortunately, mainly due to the lack of quantitative data on parameters including fugitive emissions, air exchange rate, indoor circulation, etc., household exposure is subject to limitations and constraints at this time. These constraints and limitations are borne by almost all existing literature on the health impacts of indoor air pollution, including the latest GBD study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>. There is an urgent need to develop a reliable method to characterize the process so that the overall exposure and health impacts can be fully addressed. The health benefits of the transition are expected to be even greater when household air pollution is considered. According to the evidence provided in this study, it is recommended that replacing the remaining solid fuels with affordable cleaner fuels or electricity in the rural residential sector be incorporated into the overall air pollution mitigation strategy in China. Similarly, this substitution should be encouraged in other developing countries in South Asia, Africa, and South America.

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, a rapid transition of rural residential energy away from solid fuels from 1992 to 2012 resulted in significantly reduced contributions of this sector to ambient PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, subsequently reducing both adverse health impacts and climate forcing. Despite these changes, solid fuels are still used extensively in rural China, particularly for heating, contributing significantly to air pollution and population exposure.
