 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air pollution is one of the most concerning environmental issues in China, causing more than one million premature deaths each year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Research has documented that air pollutants are primarily from power generation, industry, transportation, agriculture, and residential activities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Although residential fuel consumption contributes a very small fraction of the total energy use in China, it contributes significantly to pollutant emissions and consequently adverse health and climate impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. This is because the emission factors (EFs, quantities of air pollutants emitted per unit of fuel consumed) for extensively used solid fuels in this sector are very high. According to the latest estimation, 27% primary PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) and 51% BC (black carbon) emissions in mainland China were from the residential sector in 2014, and nearly 80% was from rural areas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately, without enough first-hand data, the important role that residential energy transition can play in mitigating health burdens has hardly been justified. The residential sector has long been overlooked for its contribution to air pollution in China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, likely because the relatively low contribution of the residential sector to total energy use was known, whereas very high EFs are often not aware of. Another obstacle for better understanding is the fact that residential energy consumption and emissions were poorly recorded in comparison with other sectors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, leading to higher uncertainties in emission estimations. Consequently, the residential sector is the “shortest wooden bar” in the overall evaluation of emissions and air pollution.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, a thorough nationwide survey was conducted to collect first-hand data on rural residential energy use from 1992 to 2012 in rural China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. A rapid transition of rural residential energy from solid fuels towards cleaner energy was revealed. The study also found that the quantities of biomass fuel use and the energy mix transition have been misestimated to a large extent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The new data from this survey provide us with a unique opportunity to improve our estimation of residential contributions to air pollution and to evaluate the impacts of the residential energy transition on health and climate forcing. In fact, the co-impacts of air pollution and co-benefits of emission reduction on health- and climate-relevant air pollutants are often expected and recognized in literature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. For example, studies quantified premature deaths avoided and the influence on radiative forcing induced by using low sulfur jet and ship fuels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, and co-benefits from increasing household insulation in U.S. households have been previously reported
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we quantitatively distinguish emissions from rural residential sources and all other sectors based on the newly compiled emission inventories of major air pollutants, model the contributions of the rural residential sector to ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, and evaluate the co-impacts of the residential energy transition on air pollution-associated health and climate radiative forcing (see Method). The reason for focusing on rural areas is because the majority of residential emissions in China are from rural areas where the detailed residential energy survey was targeted.
