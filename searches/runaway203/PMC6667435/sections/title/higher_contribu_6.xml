 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In comparison with other major emission sectors including power stations, industry, and transportation, after the rapid transition towards clean fuels and electricity, the relative contribution of the residential sector to the annual mean PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> PWC (21 ± 14%) has been relatively low. However, because of the strong seasonality of heating needs in northern China, there has been very high seasonal variation in this contribution. For example, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> shows the monthly contributions of rural residential emissions to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in China in 1992 and shows strong seasonality. On a national scale, the rural residential sector contributed 33 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> to ambient air in the three winter months from December to February, while the summer value was only 12 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the seasonal patterns were similar among the four study years, the differences between the heating and non-heating seasons increased over this period. The ratios of the relative contributions between winter and summer months increased from 1.8 (1992) to 2.4 (2002), 2.8 (2007), and 3.7 (2012). This trend can be explained by the fact that, at this stage, the rural residential energy transition occurred primarily for cooking activities. The time-sharing fraction of using LPG, biogas, and electricity for cooking increased from 7% in 1992 to 59% in 2012, whereas the fraction for heating only reached 15% in 2012

  </span>. Because cooking emissions tend to remain constant between seasons, the cooking energy transition-induced decrease in PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations did not vary among months. On the other hand, the heating energy transition, which can lead to seasonal change, occurred at a much slower pace and largely in mid-latitude provinces where heating is needed for no more than a few weeks

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, residents cannot shift to electricity or gas for heating due to the high cost and their low income
