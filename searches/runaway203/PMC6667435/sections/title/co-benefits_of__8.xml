 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With significant contributions to exposure, adverse health effects from rural residential emissions are inevitable. Additionally, the residential energy transition away from solid fuels can reduce health impacts. Based on the modelled PWC and the corresponding dose-response relationship, the annual premature deaths caused by ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> originating from rural residential emissions were calculated (see Method) for each year studied, and the result is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. The health impacts of other pollutants, such as O
  <sub>3</sub> and CO were not evaluated in this study due to the relatively low impacts originating from this sector and a shortage of emission data.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study found that the rural residential emission-associated premature deaths were as high as 570,000 (370,000–710,000 with the 95% uncertainty interval) in 1992 and decreased to 210,000 (140,000–260,000) in 2012 according to the GEMM model. Although baseline mortality rates changed rapidly during this period, the decrease in the mortality attributable to rural residential emissions was still significant from 1992 to 2012, with the influence of the population growth, aging, and age-standardised mortality rate adjusted (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The estimated number of deaths avoided due to decreased rural residential exposure was approximately 130,000 (90,000–160,000). During the same period, because of general increase in emissions from other anthropogenic sources, the total premature deaths induced by exposure to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> from all sources increased by 15%, which is consistent with the trend in the GBD study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. This outcome indicates the important health consequences of this emission source as well as the significant health benefits of the rural energy transition. Compared with all other emission sources, the relative contribution of residential emissions to the total premature deaths caused by exposure to ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> from all sources decreased from 33% in 1992 to 10% in 2012 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). This rapid decrease was due to decreased emissions from this sector whereas increased emissions from many other sources. The difference between the relative contributions to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (21%) and to health effects (10%) in 2012 is partly due to the nonlinearity of the dose-response curves. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, because of the increased emissions from other sources from 1992 to 2012, the frequency distribution of PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> PWC shifted towards the right, whereas the response curves were relatively flat.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> reported relatively small numbers of premature deaths in China (220,000, 170,000, and 130,000 in 1990, 2005, and 2010, respectively), because only cooking fuels were considered, a similar decreasing trend was demonstrated. Two other studies focused on the health impacts of sector emissions on a global scale and reported in 2005 that a total of 207,000 deaths in China could be avoided if global residential emissions were zeroed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> compares the geographical distributions of premature deaths originating from rural residential emissions between 1992 and 2012. In both years, the higher mortality areas were the North China Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and the Sichuan Basin. The mortalities decreased throughout all of eastern China over the 20-year period, with an increasing downward trend towards the coastal areas. This trend is likely linked to faster socioeconomic development and the consequent rapid rural residential energy transition in the east. Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> also shows the cumulative frequency distributions of the calculated grid mortality in 1992 and 2012. The fraction of the population facing a risk above 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> due to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> from all emission sources increased from 76% in 1992 to 84% in 2012; however, in this period, the relative contribution of rural residential emissions to premature deaths shifted in the opposite direction from 33% to 10%.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual mean radiative forcing values attributable to rural residential emissions in China were calculated for the four study years as the differences between the radiative forcing derived based on all anthropogenic emissions and that based on all but rural residential emissions using the OSCAR model (see Method). Among the components studied, CO
  <sub>2</sub> and BC contributed positively to climate forcing, whereas primary organic aerosol (POA), nitrate, and sulfate contributed negatively. According to our results, five components from the rural residential sector contributed +0.006 ± 0.004 (CO
  <sub>2</sub>), +0.049 ± 0.007 (BC), −0.019 ± 0.002 (POA), −0.002 ± 0.000 (nitrate), and −0.003 ± 0.000 (sulfate) W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2012, with a net contribution of +0.031 ± 0.008 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This contribution is equivalent to 12.5% of the total forcing caused by CO
  <sub>2</sub> from all sources in 2012. Of the five components, BC was the most important component, whereas the CO
  <sub>2</sub> contribution was much smaller. Indeed, CO
  <sub>2</sub> from the rural residential sector was merely 2.6% of the total CO
  <sub>2</sub> from all sources in 2012

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, mainly because the majority of biomass fuels, including all crop residues and most fuelwood consumed in rural China, are carbon neutral
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Meanwhile, fossil fuels consumed in the rural residential sector accounted for a very small fraction of the total
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. From 1992 to 2012, the rural residential energy transition from solid fuels to clean fuels resulted in a reduction in climate forcing. The absolute contributions of all five components, whether positive or negative forcers, decreased over the two decades. Although the CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from LPG and electricity consumption increased, the decrease in CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from fuelwood use was faster, leading to a net reduction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from this sector from 1992 to 2012. Because BC contributed much more than all others in absolute terms, despite the opposite effects of other forcing components, the residential energy transition-induced decrease in the BC emissions from biomass burning led to a significant decrease in net radiative forcing of 61%, from 0.057 ± 0.016 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> to 0.031 ± 0.008 W/m

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One limitation of this study is that only the influences on ambient air pollution and associated health impacts were addressed. In reality, another equally, if not more, important effect caused by solid fuel consumption, and impacted by the transition away from it, is household air pollution associated with emissions from indoor solid fuel combustion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Both ambient and household air quality can benefit from the rural residential energy transition. Unfortunately, mainly due to the lack of quantitative data on parameters including fugitive emissions, air exchange rate, indoor circulation, etc., household exposure is subject to limitations and constraints at this time. These constraints and limitations are borne by almost all existing literature on the health impacts of indoor air pollution, including the latest GBD study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. There is an urgent need to develop a reliable method to characterize the process so that the overall exposure and health impacts can be fully addressed. The health benefits of the transition are expected to be even greater when household air pollution is considered. According to the evidence provided in this study, it is recommended that replacing the remaining solid fuels with affordable cleaner fuels or electricity in the rural residential sector be incorporated into the overall air pollution mitigation strategy in China. Similarly, this substitution should be encouraged in other developing countries in South Asia, Africa, and South America.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, a rapid transition of rural residential energy away from solid fuels from 1992 to 2012 resulted in significantly reduced contributions of this sector to ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, subsequently reducing both adverse health impacts and climate forcing. Despite these changes, solid fuels are still used extensively in rural China, particularly for heating, contributing significantly to air pollution and population exposure.
