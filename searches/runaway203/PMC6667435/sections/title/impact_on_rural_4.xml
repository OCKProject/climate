 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the emissions from this sector occur only in rural areas, their contribution to air pollution is not limited to such areas. According to the model results, the absolute contribution of rural residential emissions to the average ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentration in cities (13 ± 10 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) was even higher than that in rural areas (5.3 ± 6.0 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>). This outcome occurred because vast areas in western China with very low population densities are far from high emission regions, whereas most populated cities are located in eastern China and surrounded by highly populated rural villages. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the PWC between rural (13 ± 6 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) and urban (14 ± 13 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) areas, due to higher urban population density. In relative terms, the contributions of rural residential emissions in rural areas, for both air concentration (33 ± 17%) and PWC (23 ± 13%), were higher than those in urban areas (21 ± 15% and 20 ± 17%, respectively), due to strong emissions from other sectors in urban areas.
