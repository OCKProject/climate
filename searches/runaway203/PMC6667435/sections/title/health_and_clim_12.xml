  </span>. Premature deaths from acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) for children under five, ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (Stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC) were estimated from the exposure and the latest hazard ratios in the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) constructed by Burnett et al. (2018)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. The population-attributable fraction and annual premature death rate were calculated based on the provincial background disease burdens reported by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Changes in the background disease burden over the 20-year period were considered, and the ratios of urban and rural background disease incidents to total provincial background disease incidents were derived
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. The relative contributions of exposure, population growth, population ageing, and baseline mortality rates were analysed after Cohen et al., (2017)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Health impact models, especially does-response functions, affect estimated premature deaths considerably. For comparison, premature deaths were also calculated using the Integrated Risk Function developed by the GBD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> and the results are compared in the Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>. As expected, the GEMM model yielded more premature deaths than the GBD model. However, the relative contributions of rural residential emissions to the total premature deaths and the temporal trend were similar between these two approaches (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>).

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual mean radiative forcing attributable to rural residential emissions was the difference between two scenarios of all anthropogenic emissions with and without rural residential sources. To estimate the radiative forcing, the global biogeochemical cycle model OSCAR (v2.1) was used
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. The OSCAR model is a reduced-form model used widely in the climate change research community. This model was developed with the three principles of embedding as many components and processes as possible, building as a meta-model capable of emulating the sensitivity of models with higher resolution or superior complexity, and comprising as a dynamic model of the Earth system

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The model outputs include radiative forcing of each climate-relevant component and global surface temperature change, and the inputs are emissions of various compounds and drivers related to land-use and land-cover change. A detailed description of the model was presented by Gasser et al. (2017)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. To estimate the contributions from rural residential sources, the model was run three times using different emission scenarios, in line with those model scenarios in the atmospheric chemical transport modelling, and the normalized marginal method was used (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The derived climate forcing components discussed in this study included CO
  <sub>2</sub>, BC, POA, sulfate, and nitrate, of which residential coal and biomass burning are usually the larger emitters of these compounds or their precursors. The contributions of residential combustion emissions to ozone precursors and methane are relatively small compared to its contribution to aerosol

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Although this is a simple box-model without seasonal variation, it is very efficient in terms of computation. As a parametric model with most parameters previously calibrated against complex models during a meta-modelling process
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
