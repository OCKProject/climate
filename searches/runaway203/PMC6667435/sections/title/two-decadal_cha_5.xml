 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the contribution of the rural residential sector to air pollution remained significant in 2012, it was even higher prior to 2012. Because of the rapid transition of the rural residential energy mix over the past two decades, from domination by solid fuels to clean fuels and electricity, the contribution of this sector to the ambient air concentration has decreased. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the decreasing trends of the PWC in both absolute (A) and relative (B) terms for urban, rural, and national averages from 1992 to 2012. In 1992, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to the overall ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> and PWC were as high as 45 ± 11% and 39 ± 13%, respectively. Over the 20-year period, the national average PWC decreased by ~26% from 18 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> to 14 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>. The relative decrease of the national average was even more rapid from 39% to 21% because the air pollutant emissions from other sectors increased during this same period

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. This increase is particularly true for urban areas after 2002. For example, against the decreasing trend in NOx emissions from the rural residential sector, the total NOx emissions from all sources jumped 316% from 1992 to 2012, primarily driven by the massive industrialization and explosive growth of the passenger car fleet
