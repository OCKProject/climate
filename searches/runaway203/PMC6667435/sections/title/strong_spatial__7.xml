 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the temporal changes, there was also strong spatial variation in the contributions of rural residential emissions to ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, which is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> as provincial averages. Although the national average contribution of rural residential sources to the annual mean ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> was 5.4 ± 6.1 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> in 2012, the contributions in eastern China, where the majority of the population reside, were much higher than those in western China. The heating activity not only caused significant seasonal differences (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) but also different geographical distribution patterns of the contributions, with much higher levels in northern China during heating periods due to high heating demand. The spatial variation was enhanced by population weighting for assessing exposure, as shown by provincial averages in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>. The overlay of the sources (emissions) and receptors (population) led to an even sharper contrast between the heavily and less polluted regions.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current air pollution control strategy focuses on the most polluted and populated regions, including the North China Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and Northeastern Plain, where ambient PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in winter are generally higher than those in summer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In addition to poor dispersion conditions, heating activity in rural areas is definitely one of the most important reasons for the severe air pollution in winter. Despite increasing concerns on this issue
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, the contribution to exposure has not been well quantified in the literature. To fill this data gap, the contributions of rural residential emissions to the PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in all provinces were calculated. The results are listed in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> in both absolute and relative terms. The relatively high standard deviation values indicate high spatial variation. For the provinces in the North China Plain and Guanzhong Plain, the annual mean contributions were not higher than the national averages. However, the winter (January) values were much higher. For most provinces in the northeast, north, and northwest, except for Beijing and Tianjin, the relative contributions in January were between 27% and 51%, accounting for approximately one-third to one-half of the PWC in the region. The values for the residential emissions alone are already approaching or exceeding the National Grade-I standard of 35 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. More importantly, the absolute contributions of rural residential emissions to the PWC in cities in eastern China are often close to, or even higher than, those in rural areas. For example, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> PWC in urban and rural areas in Heilongjiang were 24 ± 14% and 32 ± 10%, respectively. The values were 41 ± 29% and 18 ± 9% for the urban and rural areas in Inner Mongolia, respectively, likely due to the very low population density in rural areas. Although the relative contributions in western provinces such as Xingjiang (34 ± 25%) and Qinghai (23 ± 14%) were even higher, the absolute contributions were much lower (2.9 ± 2.8 and 3.3 ± 2.6 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>, respectively) than those in the east. The contributions were much higher in 1992 compared to those in 2012, indicating a rapid reduction due to the clean energy transition. For example, the absolute and relative contributions in January in 1992 were as high as 53 ± 25 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> and 60 ± 15% in Hebei, and 77 ± 16 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> and 69 ± 7% in Henan provinces, respectively, which are among the most populated provinces in China. The rural residential energy transition resulted in a significantly reduced contribution to overall air pollution. Although this trend is promising, the rural residential sector still plays a critical role in PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> pollution, especially in northern China during winter. The emissions from this source should be remediated before the nationwide air pollution issue can finally be solved.
