         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examine the suitability of the available models to carry out D&amp;A by comparing
            the decadal-frequency variability simulated by individual model historical experiment
            realisations with observations. The individual monthly anomaly time series for 1906–2005
            were filtered with a 5–20 year band-pass filter (see details in Supplementary material)
            and the standard deviation of filtered anomaly for ALLIN and the seven homogeneous
            regions is plotted against the linear trend of the unfiltered time series (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). The linear trend for each of the observations with its 5–95% uncertainty range
            shows that the two datasets are in very good agreement for all the regions except
            ECIND (Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>). The CRU time series consistently shows much higher variability than the IITM data
            in all regions though the standard deviations in the two coastal regions ECIND and
            WCIND are more in agreement. The discrepancies are mainly due to the larger number
            of stations included in the IITM dataset and possibly also differences in the homogenization
            and area averaging/gridding procedures. We note that these differences in variability
            between the two datasets could have a bearing on the results of D&amp;A analysis. In terms
            of the variability, most model simulations are clustered around the IITM value in
            all the regions. The WHIND region (Fig. 
            <a>2h</a>) stands out as the one region where model simulated variability is lower than observed
            for most models and to a lesser extent the NCIND and NWIND regions where the GISS-E2-R,
            GISS-E2-H and CSIRO-MK3-6.0 have lower than observed variability. Taylor Diagrams
            <span><a>15</a></span> comparing CRU and the different experiments and realizations against the IITM reference
            dataset are shown in Fig. 
            <a>S1</a> (Supplementary Information). Among the five experiments, the historicalNat simulations
            are least correlated with observations and the historical and historicalGHG simulations
            have the highest correlation with observations. The standard deviations in this figure
            reveal that historicalNat simulations have less than observed variability whereas
            historicalAA, historicalAnt, historical, and historicalGHG simulations have higher
            standard deviation than observations. Note that this standard deviation includes variations
            on all time-scales and trends in the data as they were computed using unfiltered annual
            mean time-series. On the whole given the small areas of the regions, the CMIP5 simulations
            perform quite well and the realistic simulation of low-frequency variability is encouraging
            for carrying out the D&amp;A analysis. While carrying out the D&amp;A analysis using individual
            models may give different results, we include all the models in our analysis by averaging
            across models (after averaging each across realisations) thereby giving each model
            equal weightage rather than weighting each realisation equally (see Supplementary
            Information for details).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to examine the sensitivity of our results to D&amp;A methodology, we used three
            variants of regression based optimal fingerprint approaches in our analysis of TAS
            over the Indian region - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
            <span><a>16</a></span>, Total Least Squares (TLS)
            <span><a>17</a></span>, and Regularized Optimal Fingerprinting (ROF)
            <span><a>18</a></span>. In all three methods we regress the observations on to the model simulated signals.
            We calculate the scaling factors for time-series of individual regions and for a combined
            “All Region” where we retain the spatial information from the seven homogeneous zones
            (See Supplementary Information for further details). Note that “All Region” is different
            from ALLIN we have used previously to denote a spatial average over India. We estimate
            these regressions separately for three time periods (the 50-year periods 1906–1955
            and 1956–2005, and the full 100-year period 1906–2005) and two averaging time-lengths
            (non-overlapping decadal and pentadal averages).

            Information for further details). In Fig. 
            <a>3a</a> the “All Region” scaling factors for annual mean temperatures from three different
            regression methods, two observational data sets, and two averaging time-lengths are
            shown for the 1956–2005 period. We note that for both the decadal and pentadal analysis,
            the ANT signal amplitudes from all three methods for both the CRU and IITM reference
            data are consistent with unity. In all three decadal analyses the amplitude of the
            NAT signal is consistent with unity for the IITM dataset but consistent with zero
            for CRU. However, for the pentadal analysis, the NAT signal is consistent with unity
            only for the ROF method using IITM. The best estimate scaling factors for ANT and
            NAT in two-signal decadal analyses of “All Region”, together with their marginal confidence
            intervals and joint confidence regions for each of the observed data sets are shown
            in Fig. 
            <a>S2</a> (Supplementary Information). The ANT scaling factors are consistent with one for
            OLS, TLS, and ROF methods while the NAT scaling factors are not significantly different
            from zero. This indicates that the simulated ANT response is consistent with observed
            changes while the NAT forcings are not substantially contributing to observed changes.

            <a>3b</a> the linear trends of scaled reconstructed TAS over the 1956–2005 period are shown,
            revealing that the observed and reconstructed total linear change are in good agreement
            in the Decadal ROF and all the Pentadal analyses. Furthermore, the reconstructed trends
            are almost entirely as a result of the ANT forcing with negligible contribution of
            NAT forcings to the trends. Examining the trends from the decadal ROF analysis over
            the 1956–2005 period gives attributable trends (in °C per 50 years given as 5–95%
            range) for ANT of (0.44, 0.86), for NAT of (−0.01, 0.03), and the best estimate reconstructed

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we analyse the individual homogeneous zones, we can detect the influence of ANT
            forcing over the WCIND, IPIND, and ECIND regions for both observational datasets.
            Additionally, the magnitude of observed trend is almost entirely due to ANT trend
            in each of these cases (see Fig. 
            <a>S3a</a> in the Supplementary Information). The Western Himalayan region (WHIND) has seen
            the largest rates of warming among all the regions and although responses to ANT and
            NAT forcings are detected (only for the IITM dataset), ANT forcing contributes to
            nearly all of the trend. These are robust except for the decadal analysis using the
            ROF method which fails the residual consistency check. The Residual Consistency Check
            (RCC; see Supplementary Material for details) - carried out for all 3 methods in each
            of the individual regions and seasons - tests the hypothesis that model simulated
            internal variability is consistent with observed (similar to what Fig. 
            <a>2</a> shows). Unlike the “All Region” case (which includes the spatial dimension also)
            the individual regions only have 5 decadal time points leading to a situation where
            there is very little information left to estimate the residual’s variance. When we
            consider the 100-year long 1906–2005 period also (see Fig. 
            <a>S3b</a> in Supplementary Information) we see similar detection of ANT signals in the WCIND,
            IPIND, ECIND, and WHIND regions. Between 1906–1955 (see Fig. 
            <a>S3c</a> in Supplementary Information), the observed trends in each of the regions are smaller
            and we were unable to attribute these changes to either NAT or ANT forcings. It is
            therefore clear that most of the changes in annual mean TAS seen in the 100 year period
            have occurred over the second 50-year period (1956–2005), and that ANT forcing is
            responsible for almost all of the change.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now focus our attention on WCIND and WHIND regions to delve into the seasonality
            of changes. Figure 
            <a>4a</a> shows that, over the WCIND region, ANT forcing is detected for each of the seasons
            and annual mean irrespective of observed dataset used. Moreover, the effects of NAT
            forcings are not detected. This is robust across the different methods - except the
            decadal ROF analysis where the RCC fails for reasons noted earlier. The effects of
            ANT forcings are detected in the DJF season over the WHIND in the pentadal analysis
            (Fig. 
            <a>4b</a>). The effects of NAT forcings are also detected but do not make a significant contribution
            to the annual mean trends and contribute to a slight warming during the MAM and SON
            seasons. This is also revealed in the reconstructed pentadal time series (see Fig. 
            <a>S4</a> in Supplementary Information). The NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions have smaller observed
            trends when compared to the other regions and we were able to detect the ANT forcing
            effects only when using the CRU dataset (see Fig.S3a in Supplementary Information).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since anthropogenic forcings include the effects of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic
            aerosols, and land-use land-cover changes (LULC) we explore the possibility of decomposing
            the ANT signal into these signals. The treatment of anthropogenic aerosols and LULC
            are quite different from model to model with some models not including the indirect
            effects of aerosols (see Table 
            <a>S1</a> in the Supplementary Information for details). One of the models considered (CSIRO-MK3-6-0)
            did not include changes in LULC and neither the CMIP5 experimental setup nor the specific
            models chosen included an LULC only set of runs. It is not always possible to decompose
            the signals as a simple linear addition of forcings - for instance, the combination
            of greenhouse gases and indirect effects of aerosols
            <span><a>20</a></span>. We therefore decompose the ANT signal into a GHG forcing driven signal and an “Other
            Anthropogenic” (OA) signal (as in ref.
            <span><a>21</a></span>) which subsumes all non-GHG anthropogenic forcings under the “OA” forcing. For this
            the historical, historicalGHG, and historicalNAT simulations were used to construct
            the transformation equation for deducing the scaling factors

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
            <a>5</a> shows the results of the three-signal analyses of annual mean TAS over “All Region”
            for the 1956–2005 period. The scaling factors in Fig. 
            <a>5a</a> show that the influence of GHG forcing can be detected over “All Region” for both
            observations and in all cases except pentadal TLS analysis with CRU observations.
            The effect of OA forcings can be detected in all cases where IITM observations are
            used but in none of the cases when CRU is used. Although the analysis reveals a detectable
            NAT signal for many cases, the trend contribution from NAT is minimal as seen in Fig. 
            <a>5b</a>. The dominant signal in all the cases seen is the positive trend from GHG forcing
            with the negative trend produced by OA forcings counteracting it. This results in
            a net positive trend in the reconstructed TAS that closely matches the observed trends.
            The uncertainty range of scaling factors and trends for GHG forcing are smaller than
            those for OA and NAT forcings. Moreover the amplitudes of the two anthropogenic signals
            (GHG &amp; OA) are highly correlated as evidenced by the strong tilt in the marginal uncertainty
            ellipse (see Fig. 
            <a>S5</a> in Supplementary Information).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we analyse the “All Region” changes for individual seasons, there are numerous
            cases where we detect the effects of GHG and OA forcings (Fig. 
            <a>S6a</a> in Supplementary Information). However, these are not consistent across seasons or
            observational datasets. The effects of NAT forcings are detected in a handful of cases
            but do not contribute significantly to the trends. The 100-year 1906–2005 period on
            the other hand provides the strongest evidence of the combined influence of the GHG
            and OA forcings irrespective of observational dataset used, particularly through the
            decadal analysis for all the seasons and the pentadal ROF analysis of the Annual,
            DJF, MAM, and SON seasons (see Fig. 
            <a>S6b</a> in Supplementary Information). The NAT forcings are also clearly detected in the
            MAM and JJA (decadal analysis only) seasons although they contribute only a very small
            negative trend. Over the 1906–1955 period, the small observed trends were found to
            be due to NAT forcings in the MAM season but are otherwise not detected in any season
            (Fig. 
            <a>S6c</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the analysis of individual homogeneous regions, we detect the effects of GHG forcing
            in the WCIND region with the pentadal analysis for all seasons except the MAM season
            with some sensitivity to observational dataset used (Fig. 
            <a>S7a</a> in Supplementary Information). Barring one case, the effects of OA are not detected
            at all in this region. Over the WHIND region, the effects of GHG and OA forcings are
            detected in the DJF season for pentadal analysis only (Fig. 
            <a>S7b</a> in Supplementary Information). The WHIND region also indicates a detectable influence
            of NAT forcings in the pentadal analysis of Annual, MAM and SON seasons which results
            in a very small negative trend. The MAM season decadal analysis shows clear detection
            of the influence of GHG, OA, and NAT forcings for the WHIND. Analysis of the Annual
            mean TAS in the ECIND region shows that the effect of GHG forcings is detected, but
            not that of OA or NAT (not shown). In the IPIND, NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions we
            were not able to detect the effects of GHG or OA forcings except in one or two cases.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recognising that the forcings under “OA” predominantly include the effects of anthropogenic
            aerosols and LULCC, the inclusion/omission of indirect effects of aerosols is likely
            an important factor that determines the amount of cooling produced by aerosol effects
            <span><a>21</a></span>. To investigate this further, we ran the three signal analysis with only the subset
            of models that include the indirect effects of models and land use changes (i.e by
            dropping the GFDL-ESM2M, CCSM4, and CSIRO-MK3-6-0 models from our analysis). The results
            thus obtained were not very different from the analysis that included all the models
            except for a reduction in the uncertainty ranges around the
