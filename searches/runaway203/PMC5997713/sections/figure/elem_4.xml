   <span class="bold">a)</span> The three signal scaling factors and their 5–95% uncertainty levels for “All Region” estimated for both decadal and pentadal annual averages between 1956–2005 using OLS, TLS, and ROF methods. (
   <span class="bold">b)</span> Best estimate and 5–95% uncertainty range of individual forcing contributions and total linear change of “All Region” annual mean temperature (°C) for 1956–2005 shown for pentadal and decadal analysis. Best estimates are shown with central 90% uncertainty range. The two solid black symbols indicate cases where Residual Consistency Check (RCC) fails for the corresponding observed datasets and the asterisk indicates cases where the influence of a particular forcing has been detected. It may be noted that no cases fail the RCC. Observed trend uncertainties (5–95%) were calculated as in ref.
