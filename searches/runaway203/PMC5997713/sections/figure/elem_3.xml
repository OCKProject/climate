   <span class="bold">a)</span> West Coast (WCIND) and (
   <span class="bold">b)</span> Western Himalayas (WHIND). The hatched bars and non-hatched bars represent the analysis using IITM and CRU as observed dataset respectively. Red(ANT), blue(NAT), green(Best Estimate), and gray(Observed) bars represent the total linear change of simulated response and observations. The cases where effects of ANT (NAT) forcings were detected are marked using red (blue) symbols with circles representing IITM dataset and triangles representing CRU. The black symbols represent cases where the residual consistency check (RCC) failed. Where bars are missing, either the RCC fails for the corresponding signal or there was no detection (β &lt; 0). Observed trend uncertainties (5–95%) were calculated as in ref.
