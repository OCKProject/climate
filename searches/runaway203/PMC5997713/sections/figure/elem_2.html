            <span>a)</span> The two signal scaling factors and their 5–95% uncertainty levels for “All Region”,
            estimated for Decadal and Pentadal annual averages between 1956–2005 using OLS, TLS,
            and ROF methods. (
            <span>b)</span> Best estimate and 5–95% uncertainty range of individual forcing contributions and
            total linear change of “All Region” annual mean temperature (°C) for 1956–2005 shown
            for Pentadal and decadal analysis. Best estimates are shown with central 90% uncertainty
            range. The two solid black symbols indicate cases where Residual Consistency Check
            (RCC) fails for the corresponding observed datasets and the asterisk indicates cases
            where the influence of a particular forcing has been detected. It may be noted that
            no cases fail the RCC. Observed trend uncertainties (5–95%) were calculated as in
            ref.
