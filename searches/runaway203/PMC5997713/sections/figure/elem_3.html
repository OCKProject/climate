            means over 1956–2005 period for (
            <span>a)</span> West Coast (WCIND) and (
            <span>b)</span> Western Himalayas (WHIND). The hatched bars and non-hatched bars represent the analysis
            using IITM and CRU as observed dataset respectively. Red(ANT), blue(NAT), green(Best
            Estimate), and gray(Observed) bars represent the total linear change of simulated
            response and observations. The cases where effects of ANT (NAT) forcings were detected
            are marked using red (blue) symbols with circles representing IITM dataset and triangles
            representing CRU. The black symbols represent cases where the residual consistency
            check (RCC) failed. Where bars are missing, either the RCC fails for the corresponding
            signal or there was no detection (β &lt; 0). Observed trend uncertainties (5–95%) were
            calculated as in ref.
