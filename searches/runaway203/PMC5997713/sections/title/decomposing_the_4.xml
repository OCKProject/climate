 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since anthropogenic forcings include the effects of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, and land-use land-cover changes (LULC) we explore the possibility of decomposing the ANT signal into these signals. The treatment of anthropogenic aerosols and LULC are quite different from model to model with some models not including the indirect effects of aerosols (see Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> in the Supplementary Information for details). One of the models considered (CSIRO-MK3-6-0) did not include changes in LULC and neither the CMIP5 experimental setup nor the specific models chosen included an LULC only set of runs. It is not always possible to decompose the signals as a simple linear addition of forcings - for instance, the combination of greenhouse gases and indirect effects of aerosols
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. We therefore decompose the ANT signal into a GHG forcing driven signal and an “Other Anthropogenic” (OA) signal (as in ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>) which subsumes all non-GHG anthropogenic forcings under the “OA” forcing. For this the historical, historicalGHG, and historicalNAT simulations were used to construct the transformation equation for deducing the scaling factors

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the results of the three-signal analyses of annual mean TAS over “All Region” for the 1956–2005 period. The scaling factors in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a> show that the influence of GHG forcing can be detected over “All Region” for both observations and in all cases except pentadal TLS analysis with CRU observations. The effect of OA forcings can be detected in all cases where IITM observations are used but in none of the cases when CRU is used. Although the analysis reveals a detectable NAT signal for many cases, the trend contribution from NAT is minimal as seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>. The dominant signal in all the cases seen is the positive trend from GHG forcing with the negative trend produced by OA forcings counteracting it. This results in a net positive trend in the reconstructed TAS that closely matches the observed trends. The uncertainty range of scaling factors and trends for GHG forcing are smaller than those for OA and NAT forcings. Moreover the amplitudes of the two anthropogenic signals (GHG &amp; OA) are highly correlated as evidenced by the strong tilt in the marginal uncertainty ellipse (see Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a> in Supplementary Information).

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we analyse the “All Region” changes for individual seasons, there are numerous cases where we detect the effects of GHG and OA forcings (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6a</a> in Supplementary Information). However, these are not consistent across seasons or observational datasets. The effects of NAT forcings are detected in a handful of cases but do not contribute significantly to the trends. The 100-year 1906–2005 period on the other hand provides the strongest evidence of the combined influence of the GHG and OA forcings irrespective of observational dataset used, particularly through the decadal analysis for all the seasons and the pentadal ROF analysis of the Annual, DJF, MAM, and SON seasons (see Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6b</a> in Supplementary Information). The NAT forcings are also clearly detected in the MAM and JJA (decadal analysis only) seasons although they contribute only a very small negative trend. Over the 1906–1955 period, the small observed trends were found to be due to NAT forcings in the MAM season but are otherwise not detected in any season (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6c</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the analysis of individual homogeneous regions, we detect the effects of GHG forcing in the WCIND region with the pentadal analysis for all seasons except the MAM season with some sensitivity to observational dataset used (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7a</a> in Supplementary Information). Barring one case, the effects of OA are not detected at all in this region. Over the WHIND region, the effects of GHG and OA forcings are detected in the DJF season for pentadal analysis only (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7b</a> in Supplementary Information). The WHIND region also indicates a detectable influence of NAT forcings in the pentadal analysis of Annual, MAM and SON seasons which results in a very small negative trend. The MAM season decadal analysis shows clear detection of the influence of GHG, OA, and NAT forcings for the WHIND. Analysis of the Annual mean TAS in the ECIND region shows that the effect of GHG forcings is detected, but not that of OA or NAT (not shown). In the IPIND, NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions we were not able to detect the effects of GHG or OA forcings except in one or two cases.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recognising that the forcings under “OA” predominantly include the effects of anthropogenic aerosols and LULCC, the inclusion/omission of indirect effects of aerosols is likely an important factor that determines the amount of cooling produced by aerosol effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. To investigate this further, we ran the three signal analysis with only the subset of models that include the indirect effects of models and land use changes (i.e by dropping the GFDL-ESM2M, CCSM4, and CSIRO-MK3-6-0 models from our analysis). The results thus obtained were not very different from the analysis that included all the models except for a reduction in the uncertainty ranges around the
