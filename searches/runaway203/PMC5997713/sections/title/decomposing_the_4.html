      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since anthropogenic forcings include the effects of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic
         aerosols, and land-use land-cover changes (LULC) we explore the possibility of decomposing
         the ANT signal into these signals. The treatment of anthropogenic aerosols and LULC
         are quite different from model to model with some models not including the indirect
         effects of aerosols (see Table 
         <a>S1</a> in the Supplementary Information for details). One of the models considered (CSIRO-MK3-6-0)
         did not include changes in LULC and neither the CMIP5 experimental setup nor the specific
         models chosen included an LULC only set of runs. It is not always possible to decompose
         the signals as a simple linear addition of forcings - for instance, the combination
         of greenhouse gases and indirect effects of aerosols
         <span><a>20</a></span>. We therefore decompose the ANT signal into a GHG forcing driven signal and an “Other
         Anthropogenic” (OA) signal (as in ref.
         <span><a>21</a></span>) which subsumes all non-GHG anthropogenic forcings under the “OA” forcing. For this
         the historical, historicalGHG, and historicalNAT simulations were used to construct
         the transformation equation for deducing the scaling factors

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>5</a> shows the results of the three-signal analyses of annual mean TAS over “All Region”
         for the 1956–2005 period. The scaling factors in Fig. 
         <a>5a</a> show that the influence of GHG forcing can be detected over “All Region” for both
         observations and in all cases except pentadal TLS analysis with CRU observations.
         The effect of OA forcings can be detected in all cases where IITM observations are
         used but in none of the cases when CRU is used. Although the analysis reveals a detectable
         NAT signal for many cases, the trend contribution from NAT is minimal as seen in Fig. 
         <a>5b</a>. The dominant signal in all the cases seen is the positive trend from GHG forcing
         with the negative trend produced by OA forcings counteracting it. This results in
         a net positive trend in the reconstructed TAS that closely matches the observed trends.
         The uncertainty range of scaling factors and trends for GHG forcing are smaller than
         those for OA and NAT forcings. Moreover the amplitudes of the two anthropogenic signals
         (GHG &amp; OA) are highly correlated as evidenced by the strong tilt in the marginal uncertainty
         ellipse (see Fig. 
         <a>S5</a> in Supplementary Information).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we analyse the “All Region” changes for individual seasons, there are numerous
         cases where we detect the effects of GHG and OA forcings (Fig. 
         <a>S6a</a> in Supplementary Information). However, these are not consistent across seasons or
         observational datasets. The effects of NAT forcings are detected in a handful of cases
         but do not contribute significantly to the trends. The 100-year 1906–2005 period on
         the other hand provides the strongest evidence of the combined influence of the GHG
         and OA forcings irrespective of observational dataset used, particularly through the
         decadal analysis for all the seasons and the pentadal ROF analysis of the Annual,
         DJF, MAM, and SON seasons (see Fig. 
         <a>S6b</a> in Supplementary Information). The NAT forcings are also clearly detected in the
         MAM and JJA (decadal analysis only) seasons although they contribute only a very small
         negative trend. Over the 1906–1955 period, the small observed trends were found to
         be due to NAT forcings in the MAM season but are otherwise not detected in any season
         (Fig. 
         <a>S6c</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the analysis of individual homogeneous regions, we detect the effects of GHG forcing
         in the WCIND region with the pentadal analysis for all seasons except the MAM season
         with some sensitivity to observational dataset used (Fig. 
         <a>S7a</a> in Supplementary Information). Barring one case, the effects of OA are not detected
         at all in this region. Over the WHIND region, the effects of GHG and OA forcings are
         detected in the DJF season for pentadal analysis only (Fig. 
         <a>S7b</a> in Supplementary Information). The WHIND region also indicates a detectable influence
         of NAT forcings in the pentadal analysis of Annual, MAM and SON seasons which results
         in a very small negative trend. The MAM season decadal analysis shows clear detection
         of the influence of GHG, OA, and NAT forcings for the WHIND. Analysis of the Annual
         mean TAS in the ECIND region shows that the effect of GHG forcings is detected, but
         not that of OA or NAT (not shown). In the IPIND, NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions we
         were not able to detect the effects of GHG or OA forcings except in one or two cases.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recognising that the forcings under “OA” predominantly include the effects of anthropogenic
         aerosols and LULCC, the inclusion/omission of indirect effects of aerosols is likely
         an important factor that determines the amount of cooling produced by aerosol effects
         <span><a>21</a></span>. To investigate this further, we ran the three signal analysis with only the subset
         of models that include the indirect effects of models and land use changes (i.e by
         dropping the GFDL-ESM2M, CCSM4, and CSIRO-MK3-6-0 models from our analysis). The results
         thus obtained were not very different from the analysis that included all the models
         except for a reduction in the uncertainty ranges around the
