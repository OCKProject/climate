      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the problems of attributing changes at regional scales, numerous studies provide
         evidence of an anthropogenic influence on surface temperature at continental and subcontinental
         scales
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>7</a></span>. Temperature changes over the Indian subcontinent during the 20th Century have been
         documented
         <span><a>8</a>–
            <a>10</a></span> but have not been subject to formal D&amp;A analysis. The Indian subcontinent contains
         many sub-regions with vastly different climatic conditions and each of these have
         witnessed changes to different extents. It is critical for the mitigation and adaptation
         policy responses of a large developing economy with a population of more than a billion
         to be informed of the extent to which anthropogenic and natural factors have caused
         the observed climate changes. In this study we attempt to detect statistically significant
         changes in surface air temperature (TAS) over sub-regions of India and when detected,
         quantify contributions of natural (NAT) and anthropogenic (ANT) forcings using formal
         D&amp;A methods
         <span><a>11</a></span>. We also examine whether the anthropogenic forcings due to Greenhouse Gases (GHG)
         can be isolated from Other Anthropogenic (OA) factors. We use climate model simulations
         that include individual and combinations of forcings as prescribed in the standard
         experimental protocols of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 (CMIP5)
         <span><a>12</a></span>. We also use two publicly available long-term datasets of observed temperature over
         India; i) the CRU-3.22 gridded temperature dataset (0.5° × 0.5° resolution) available
         from 1901 to 2013
         <span><a>13</a></span>, and ii) a monthly mean temperature time-series from 1901 to 2007 for seven “homogeneous
         temperature zones” obtained from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The IITM dataset includes observations from many more stations than the CRU dataset
         over the Indian region. The Indian region (ALLIN) is further divided into seven homogenous
         temperature zones West Coast (WCIND), East Coast (ECIND), Interior Peninsula(IPIND),
         North East (NEIND), North Central(NCIND), North West (NWIND), and Western Himalaya
         (WHIND) based on geographical, topographical and climatological features. The CRU
         data is regridded to a 1° × 1° grid and masked over each homogeneous temperature zone
         (see Fig. 
         <a>1i</a>) before being spatially averaged to produce a monthly time-series analogous to the
         IITM data. The monthly mean TAS data from the piControl’, ‘historical’, ‘historicalNat’,
         ‘historicalAnt’, ‘historicalGHG’, and ‘historicalAA’ experiments were obtained from
         7 models in the CMIP5 database and treated in the same way as the CRU data (see Table 
         <a>S1</a> and details of data processing in Supplementary Information). Figure 
         <a>1a–h</a> shows the annual mean anomaly time series for each of the 8 regions from the two
         observed datasets as well as the historical and historicalNat simulations (5–95% confidence
         intervals shown in pink and light-blue shading respectively). The historical and historicalNat
         simulations are similar for most of the record but diverge from each other after about
         1990. Clearly seen in both observations and in the model simulations are the sharp
         decreases in temperature resulting from volcanic eruptions of the 20
         <span>th</span> Century.
