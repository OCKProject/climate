      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We utilize climate model output from the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
         Project CMIP5
         <span><a>12</a></span>. While output from nearly 60 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models
         (AOGCMs) are available in the CMIP5 archives, we utilize output from models that performed
         piControl (Pre-Industrial control), historicalGHG (GHG forcings only), historicalNat
         (Natural forcings only), historicalAA (forcings due to anthropogenic aerosols only)
         and historicalAnt (all forcing due to anthropogenic activities) and historical (combination
         of all forcings) experiments. The AOGCMs used in this study span a wide range of resolutions
         and sophistication of physical modeling. Each model experiment may have more than
         one ensemble member typically generated by initializing a set of runs with different,
         but equally realistic initial conditions that are distinguished by a unique realization
         number. We use the subset of models that performed all the experiments listed above
         and whose output fields included surface air temperature (TAS) and -although these
         were not analyzed for this study, minimum and maximum surface air temperature (TASMIN
         and TASMAX respectively) - in order to avoid changing sample sizes. TableÂ 
         <a>S1</a> in the Supplementary Information shows details of the models, experiments, and realizations
         used in this study.
