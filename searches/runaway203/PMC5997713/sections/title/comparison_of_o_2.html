      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examine the suitability of the available models to carry out D&amp;A by comparing
         the decadal-frequency variability simulated by individual model historical experiment
         realisations with observations. The individual monthly anomaly time series for 1906–2005
         were filtered with a 5–20 year band-pass filter (see details in Supplementary material)
         and the standard deviation of filtered anomaly for ALLIN and the seven homogeneous
         regions is plotted against the linear trend of the unfiltered time series (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). The linear trend for each of the observations with its 5–95% uncertainty range
         shows that the two datasets are in very good agreement for all the regions except
         ECIND (Fig. 
         <a>2d</a>). The CRU time series consistently shows much higher variability than the IITM data
         in all regions though the standard deviations in the two coastal regions ECIND and
         WCIND are more in agreement. The discrepancies are mainly due to the larger number
         of stations included in the IITM dataset and possibly also differences in the homogenization
         and area averaging/gridding procedures. We note that these differences in variability
         between the two datasets could have a bearing on the results of D&amp;A analysis. In terms
         of the variability, most model simulations are clustered around the IITM value in
         all the regions. The WHIND region (Fig. 
         <a>2h</a>) stands out as the one region where model simulated variability is lower than observed
         for most models and to a lesser extent the NCIND and NWIND regions where the GISS-E2-R,
         GISS-E2-H and CSIRO-MK3-6.0 have lower than observed variability. Taylor Diagrams
         <span><a>15</a></span> comparing CRU and the different experiments and realizations against the IITM reference
         dataset are shown in Fig. 
         <a>S1</a> (Supplementary Information). Among the five experiments, the historicalNat simulations
         are least correlated with observations and the historical and historicalGHG simulations
         have the highest correlation with observations. The standard deviations in this figure
         reveal that historicalNat simulations have less than observed variability whereas
         historicalAA, historicalAnt, historical, and historicalGHG simulations have higher
         standard deviation than observations. Note that this standard deviation includes variations
         on all time-scales and trends in the data as they were computed using unfiltered annual
         mean time-series. On the whole given the small areas of the regions, the CMIP5 simulations
         perform quite well and the realistic simulation of low-frequency variability is encouraging
         for carrying out the D&amp;A analysis. While carrying out the D&amp;A analysis using individual
         models may give different results, we include all the models in our analysis by averaging
         across models (after averaging each across realisations) thereby giving each model
         equal weightage rather than weighting each realisation equally (see Supplementary
         Information for details).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to examine the sensitivity of our results to D&amp;A methodology, we used three
         variants of regression based optimal fingerprint approaches in our analysis of TAS
         over the Indian region - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
         <span><a>16</a></span>, Total Least Squares (TLS)
         <span><a>17</a></span>, and Regularized Optimal Fingerprinting (ROF)
         <span><a>18</a></span>. In all three methods we regress the observations on to the model simulated signals.
         We calculate the scaling factors for time-series of individual regions and for a combined
         “All Region” where we retain the spatial information from the seven homogeneous zones
         (See Supplementary Information for further details). Note that “All Region” is different
         from ALLIN we have used previously to denote a spatial average over India. We estimate
         these regressions separately for three time periods (the 50-year periods 1906–1955
         and 1956–2005, and the full 100-year period 1906–2005) and two averaging time-lengths
         (non-overlapping decadal and pentadal averages).
