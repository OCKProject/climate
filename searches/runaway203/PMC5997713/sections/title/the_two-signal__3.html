         Information for further details). In Fig. 
         <a>3a</a> the “All Region” scaling factors for annual mean temperatures from three different
         regression methods, two observational data sets, and two averaging time-lengths are
         shown for the 1956–2005 period. We note that for both the decadal and pentadal analysis,
         the ANT signal amplitudes from all three methods for both the CRU and IITM reference
         data are consistent with unity. In all three decadal analyses the amplitude of the
         NAT signal is consistent with unity for the IITM dataset but consistent with zero
         for CRU. However, for the pentadal analysis, the NAT signal is consistent with unity
         only for the ROF method using IITM. The best estimate scaling factors for ANT and
         NAT in two-signal decadal analyses of “All Region”, together with their marginal confidence
         intervals and joint confidence regions for each of the observed data sets are shown
         in Fig. 
         <a>S2</a> (Supplementary Information). The ANT scaling factors are consistent with one for
         OLS, TLS, and ROF methods while the NAT scaling factors are not significantly different
         from zero. This indicates that the simulated ANT response is consistent with observed
         changes while the NAT forcings are not substantially contributing to observed changes.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Fig. 
         <a>3b</a> the linear trends of scaled reconstructed TAS over the 1956–2005 period are shown,
         revealing that the observed and reconstructed total linear change are in good agreement
         in the Decadal ROF and all the Pentadal analyses. Furthermore, the reconstructed trends
         are almost entirely as a result of the ANT forcing with negligible contribution of
         NAT forcings to the trends. Examining the trends from the decadal ROF analysis over
         the 1956–2005 period gives attributable trends (in °C per 50 years given as 5–95%
         range) for ANT of (0.44, 0.86), for NAT of (−0.01, 0.03), and the best estimate reconstructed
         trend of (0.43, 0.89) with the CRU observed trend of (0.45, 0.60). For the same period,
         pentadal averages reveal attributable trends for ANT of (0.36, 0.77) and NAT of (0.0,
         −0.01) with the CRU observed trend of (0.35, 0.64). Table 
         <a>1</a> shows the trends attributable to ANT and NAT forcings for the different time-periods,
         temporal averaging lengths, and observed trends for both observations and clearly
         reveals that where analysis period includes the 1956–2005 half-century, when ANT forcing
         is strongest, ANT response dominates over NAT response.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we analyse the individual homogeneous zones, we can detect the influence of ANT
         forcing over the WCIND, IPIND, and ECIND regions for both observational datasets.
         Additionally, the magnitude of observed trend is almost entirely due to ANT trend
         in each of these cases (see Fig. 
         <a>S3a</a> in the Supplementary Information). The Western Himalayan region (WHIND) has seen
         the largest rates of warming among all the regions and although responses to ANT and
         NAT forcings are detected (only for the IITM dataset), ANT forcing contributes to
         nearly all of the trend. These are robust except for the decadal analysis using the
         ROF method which fails the residual consistency check. The Residual Consistency Check
         (RCC; see Supplementary Material for details) - carried out for all 3 methods in each
         of the individual regions and seasons - tests the hypothesis that model simulated
         internal variability is consistent with observed (similar to what Fig. 
         <a>2</a> shows). Unlike the “All Region” case (which includes the spatial dimension also)
         the individual regions only have 5 decadal time points leading to a situation where
         there is very little information left to estimate the residual’s variance. When we
         consider the 100-year long 1906–2005 period also (see Fig. 
         <a>S3b</a> in Supplementary Information) we see similar detection of ANT signals in the WCIND,
         IPIND, ECIND, and WHIND regions. Between 1906–1955 (see Fig. 
         <a>S3c</a> in Supplementary Information), the observed trends in each of the regions are smaller
         and we were unable to attribute these changes to either NAT or ANT forcings. It is
         therefore clear that most of the changes in annual mean TAS seen in the 100 year period
         have occurred over the second 50-year period (1956–2005), and that ANT forcing is
         responsible for almost all of the change.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now focus our attention on WCIND and WHIND regions to delve into the seasonality
         of changes. Figure 
         <a>4a</a> shows that, over the WCIND region, ANT forcing is detected for each of the seasons
         and annual mean irrespective of observed dataset used. Moreover, the effects of NAT
         forcings are not detected. This is robust across the different methods - except the
         decadal ROF analysis where the RCC fails for reasons noted earlier. The effects of
         ANT forcings are detected in the DJF season over the WHIND in the pentadal analysis
         (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>). The effects of NAT forcings are also detected but do not make a significant contribution
         to the annual mean trends and contribute to a slight warming during the MAM and SON
         seasons. This is also revealed in the reconstructed pentadal time series (see Fig. 
         <a>S4</a> in Supplementary Information). The NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions have smaller observed
         trends when compared to the other regions and we were able to detect the ANT forcing
         effects only when using the CRU dataset (see Fig.S3a in Supplementary Information).

                  are marked using red (blue) symbols with circles representing IITM dataset and triangles

                  check (RCC) failed. Where bars are missing, either the RCC fails for the corresponding
