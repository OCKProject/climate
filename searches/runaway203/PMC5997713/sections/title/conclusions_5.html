      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using three regression based optimal fingerprint methods, two observed datasets, and
         two temporal-averaging choices we are able to robustly attribute TAS changes over
         India between 1956–2005 and 1906–2005 to anthropogenic forcing. The contributions
         of natural forcings to the observed trend during 1956–2005 period is minimal with
         a comparatively larger contribution during 1906–1955. We also find that the observed
         increases in TAS over WCIND, IPIND, ECIND, and WHIND cannot be explained by natural
         forcings or internal climate variability alone. The largest warming rates are seen
         in the Western Himalayas - a mountainous region that is likely experiencing elevation
         enhanced warming
         <span><a>22</a></span>. This has implications for the health of glaciers in this region with continued anthropogenic
         forcing leaving them more prone to mass loss and resulting downstream effects
         <span><a>23</a></span>. The influence of anthropogenic forcing is also detected in NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND,
         but only with the CRU dataset. However, the two observational datasets are different
         in the number of observing stations they include and this influences results to some
         extent. Using a three-signal analysis, we find that GHG forcing is the dominant contributor
         to the positive trends over India with OA forcings exerting a cooling influence. Over
         the individual sub-regions however, we were not able to consistently detect the influence
         of GHG and OA. The influence of aerosols
         <span><a>24</a></span> and land use (that are the main constituents of OA) cannot be separated using these
         methods which assume that signals can be decomposed as a simple linear addition of
         forcings. The impact of observational uncertainty (to the extent evident in the two
         datasets used) is clearly seen in our results for individual regions. Concerted efforts
         to quantify observational uncertainty at these smaller spatial scales are necessary
         to have better confidence in D&amp;A results and also to enable climate model improvements
