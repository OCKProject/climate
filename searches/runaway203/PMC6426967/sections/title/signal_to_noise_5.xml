 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the signal-to-noise ratio to measure how large the expected change of drought is compared to the uncertainty in the projections of drought. Understanding and modeling signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for different regions could aid water resource planning. We quantify the signal as the change of soil moisture anomalies relative to the mean of the baseline period 1976–2005 and the noise as the square root of the total uncertainty (sum of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty) in the projection

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. We calculate the S/N ratio for each pixel. We also examine the spatiotemporal variability of annual and seasonal S/N change across the globe and at different lead times (3rd decade, 6th decade, and 9th decade) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). An absolute value of S/N greater than 1 means that the magnitude of soil moisture anomaly change signal exceeds uncertainty.

    <p>The annual and seasonal signal to noise ratio of surface soil moisture anomalies for the 3rd decade, 6th decade, and 9th decade relative to mean of 1976–2005 based on CMIP5 MMEs (summer: JJA in North hemisphere and DJF in South hemisphere; winter: DJF in North hemisphere and JJA in South hemisphere). The negative values indicate drying and the positive values indicate wetting. The grids with stippling indicate an absolute value of S/N greater than 1, which means that the magnitude of soil moisture anomaly change signal exceeds uncertainty.</p>

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the end of the 21st century, the annual negative S/N occurs across the Mediterranean and Europe, in many parts in United States, Mexico, southern Africa, many parts of northern South America, Southeast China, and West Australia. However, the S/N is less than −1 in a very limited region of the Mediterranean and Europe, Southwest United States, and southern Africa. The S/N ratio for drying is stronger in the summer than the winter. The annual positive S/N are found in limited regions including mid- to high-latitude Asia, high-latitude North America, India, east Argentina, and Sahara, but no regions show S/N values greater than 1. Positive S/N are more commonly found in the winter than the summer, especially in mid- to high-latitude Asia, and high-latitude North America. The spatial patterns of S/N do not change too much through time; while the magnitude of S/N becomes slightly greater, it does not change significantly. This indicates that the spread of uncertainty becomes larger as the signal becomes stronger.</p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare the S/N of soil moisture anomaly with the S/N of temperature and precipitation projections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. The S/N of temperature is far higher than that of soil moisture anomalies over all regions and all three lead times. The S/N of temperature peaks at the middle of the 21st century which is greater than 3 in the lower- to mid-latitude and even 4 in the tropics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. For precipitation, the highest wetting S/N is mainly shown in the high-latitude region. Over lead time, the high-latitude S/N of precipitation is increasing approximately from 1 to 2 and even larger than 2 but smaller than 3
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. The drying S/N is mainly shown in the Mediterranean and Central America and the absolute value of S/N is increasing slightly from below 1 to above 1 over lead time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Thus, the S/N of both temperature and precipitation are stronger than that of the soil moisture anomalies, with the S/N of temperature far stronger.
