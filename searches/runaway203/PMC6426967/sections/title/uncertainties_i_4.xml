  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(a)</a> shows time series of global decadal mean standardized soil moisture anomalies. We perform a Mann-Kendall trend test for the time series for each model and each scenario and we found that only model FGOALS-s2 in RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 show a significantly positive trend, only model CESM1(CAM5) in RCP6.0 does not show a significant trend, and all other models in all four RCP scenarios show a significantly negative trend at a significance level of 0.05. Soil moisture is projected to decrease in the twenty-first century, with the strongest drying associated with the highest emissions scenario. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(b)</a> shows time series of global decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence, representing the month counts in a 10-year moving window when soil moisture values fall below the 10th percentile of the historical simulation (1900–2005). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(c)</a> shows time series of global decadal sum of severity, representing the sum of severity for all drought events in a 10-year moving window. The time series of decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence and sum of severity show similar results, both are projected to increase over the 21st century with the highest increase for RCP8.5, and the lowest increase for RCP6.0 before mid-century and for RCP2.6 after mid-century. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6(d)</a> shows time series of the global decadal mean spatial extent of severe drought, representing the global decadal mean percentage of areas experiencing severe drought conditions. The multi-model mean is projected to increase from approximately 10% during the 20th century to 26.5% (RCP2.6) and 35.2% (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century. Collectively, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows that the spread of different models in response to the same radiative forcing (the spread of thin lines of the same color) is much larger than the spread of the different responses depending on the radiative forcing (RCP) (the spread of four thick lines) for the 21st century.

The difference in the model response is the largest source of uncertainty (over 80%) over the entire 21st century. In the period before 2030, internal variability is the second largest source of uncertainty. After 2030, the scenario uncertainty exceeds internal variability and becomes the second largest source of uncertainty.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contributions to total uncertainty for the three drought statistics: 1-month drought occurrence, sum of severity, and spatial extent, all show similar patterns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7(b–d)</a>). The model uncertainty is always the dominant source of uncertainty during the entire 21st century. In the early period, the internal variability typically is the second largest source of uncertainty in the early half of the 21st century. By the latter half of the century, it is often exceeded by scenario uncertainty. Our finding that uncertainty in soil moisture projections is dominated by model differences contrasts with the uncertainty partition for global decadal annual mean temperature changes found by Hawkins and Sutton
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In the case of global temperature, model uncertainty is relatively high in the early part of the century, but steadily falls and is exceeded by scenario uncertainty by the middle of 21st century. By the end, the scenario uncertainty accounts for approximately 82% of the total uncertainty and the model uncertainty accounts for 18%. Our results for soil moisture more closely approach the uncertainty in precipitation projections observed by Hawkins and Sutton
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> wherein model uncertainty is the largest source of uncertainty over the entire 21st century. Of course, differences in modeled precipitation contribute greatly to simulated soil moisture differences. Yet, it is revealing that scenario uncertainty is so diminished despite the important role of temperature on evapotranspiration rates. Undoubtedly, uncertainty in simulated soil moisture values also results from the complexity of the water balance system and the model treatment of important factors, such as land use/cover, soil characteristics, landforms, vegetation, and evapotranspiration.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional patterns of uncertainty partition in decadal mean spatial extent of severe drought are similar and model uncertainty dominant uncertainty (approximately 80%) for all regions in the 21st century (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The difference across regions results mainly from the slight differences in the magnitude of scenario uncertainty shown in Fig.
