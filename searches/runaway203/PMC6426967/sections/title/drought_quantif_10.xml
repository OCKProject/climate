Here, we focus on severe drought and even worse (0 to 10th percentile), i.e., including D2, D3, and D4 drought category in USDM. A threshold value of 10% is chosen reflecting a drought condition for a specific month that could be expected once every ten years on average. Hence, following the method of Sheffield and Wood

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, for each grid point, each month, and each GCM, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is calculated for the surface soil moisture from the historical simulation (1900–2005) and then the 10% quantile threshold of surface soil moisture is computed. A 1-month drought occurrence either in the historical period or future period is defined as the month with a surface soil moisture value lower than the 10% quantile threshold based on the ECDF. We selected a long enough historical period (106-year, 1900–2005) to sufficiently account for the historical variability in surface soil moisture.

  </span>, a drought event is characterized in terms of duration, severity, intensity, and spatial extent. A consecutive sequence of 1-month drought occurrence results in a drought event of different durations. We define two types of drought duration based on the USDM: short-term drought (less than 6 months) and long-term drought (longer than or equal to 6 months). We define severity as the sum of deficit below the 10% threshold. For example, the cumulative probability of the surface soil moisture in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month during a 3-month drought event are respectively 6%, 2%, and 3%, and hence the deficit below the 10% threshold for those three months is 4%, 8%, and 7% respectively. Consequently, the sum of deficit below the threshold is 19%, i.e., the severity of this drought event is 19%. We define intensity as the mean deficit below the threshold for a drought event, i.e., severity divided by duration. For example, the intensity of this 3-month duration drought mentioned above is 19%/3 (6.33%). We define spatial extent of drought as the percentage of grid points in which the surface soil moisture falls below the threshold for each month in the region of interest. The area of each grid point is weighted by the cosine of the latitude to account for the actual grid size. We estimate the drought characteristics for the 15 regions defined by the IPCC
