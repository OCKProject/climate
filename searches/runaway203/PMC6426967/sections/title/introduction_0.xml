   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Warming associated with climate change accelerates land surface drying, enhances evapotranspiration, and increases the potential incidence and severity of droughts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts would have significant impacts on water management, natural resources, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems, and socioeconomic sectors. In the context of climate change, it is important for decision makers to understand how drought conditions might change at the regional scale in order to plan adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought is a complex multivariate phenomenon caused by the interaction of atmospheric, hydrological, and biogeophysical processes. There are considerable uncertainties in evaluating drought trends both in the instrumental record and future drought projections. For example, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> concluded that, since the 1970s, more intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas, particularly in the tropics and subtropics, which are linked with higher temperatures and decreased precipitation. However, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> indicated that the global increasing trends in drought since 1970 were no longer supported. Recent evidence has yielded conflicting results on drought changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Such phenomena demonstrate the challenges and uncertainties in quantitatively detecting long-term changes of this complex phenomenon. In addition to uncertainties with respect to past observations, there are even more considerable uncertainties associated with future drought projection centering on a different set of factors including inherent climate variability, model errors, and uncertainty in future radiative forcing.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior works investigating potential changes in drought have revealed that different drought indices can produce different results due to different variables involved in calculating the drought indices from the general circulation models (GCMs)

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Droughts involve a wide range of related variables. Different types of drought highlight different variables of interest, for example, meteorological droughts highlight precipitation, agricultural droughts highlight soil moisture, and hydrological droughts highlight streamflow/runoff 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. In this study, we focus on agricultural drought. Agricultural droughts reduce soil-water availability, affect crop production and yield, and pose threats to food security and livestock industries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Soil moisture is an important indicator for agricultural drought since it can reflect the total effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration, represent the status of agriculture, and determine the available water supply for healthy plant growth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Modeling soil moisture changes is much more complicated than precipitation and temperature. Future soil moisture changes depend on the total interaction of temperature and precipitation, the complex surface hydrological process, as well as other factors, such as wind speed, vegetation, land use/cover change, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> (influence plant stomatal conductance and hence plant transpiration)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Thus, we use soil moisture as an integrative variable to reflect the change in agricultural drought risks.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior studies have assessed and quantified the uncertainty associated with primary climate variables like surface air temperature

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> to project future drought conditions using soil moisture data from GCMs. However, fewer studies have assessed and quantified the sources of uncertainties in projecting future agricultural drought conditions. AR5 stated that the regional to global-scale projections of drought conditions remain relatively uncertain compared to other aspects of the water cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Understanding and modeling uncertainties and hotspots in drought projection are of great importance in natural resources and water resources planning management. Quantifying and partitioning uncertainty associated with drought is also very important for decision makers to understand the scope and direction for narrowing the uncertainty through investment in climate science

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use all available GCMs providing surface soil moisture outputs under the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which enable us to capture model uncertainty in the representation of climate sensitivity and climate process. We use all available representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, which enable us to understand the uncertainty originating from unknown future greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing. We focus on agricultural drought and use soil moisture as an important indicator for agricultural drought. We analyze the raw GCMs outputs for surface soil moisture, instead of computing drought indices from related variables, which may introduce additional uncertainty. First, we investigate the multi-model ensemble (MME) annual and seasonal percentage change of surface soil moisture and evaluate the statistical significance of change using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each grid by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05. Second, we calculate the duration, frequency, severity, and spatial extent of severe agricultural drought and analyze the spatial-temporal change of those drought characteristics. Third, we quantify and partition the three sources of uncertainty associated with these drought projections: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Finally, we examine the spatiotemporal variability of annual and seasonal signal to noise (S/N) change in soil moisture anomalies across the globe and for different lead times to measure the magnitude of the expected change compared with the uncertainty in the projection.</p>
